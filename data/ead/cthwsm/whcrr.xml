<head>Biography</head>
<p>The Henry Whitfield State Museum, established by the State of Connecticut in 1899, explores four centuries of Connecticut history through the evolution of the 1639 Whitfield House. Thirty-two years after the founding of Jamestown and nineteen years after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, a group of English Puritans journeyed across the Atlantic Ocean to establish a community in the New World free from religious persecution. They were led by their minister, Reverend Henry Whitfield. The Whitfield family home also served as a fort for the community. Its massive stone walls and chimneys, steeply-pitched roof, and casement windows reflect the style of post-medieval domestic architecture found in England - rare in 17th-century America and unique today. Through the years, the "Old Stone House" has undergone many changes and many families have called it home. Restored by noted architects Norman Isham and J. Frederick Kelly in the early 1900s, the house is an important example of Colonial Revival restoration work. Based on these restorations, the Whitfield House was designated a National Historic Landmark. The museum and library collections number over 10,000 items.</p>
