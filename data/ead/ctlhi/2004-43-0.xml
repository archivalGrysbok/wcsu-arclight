	<head>Scope and Contents</head>
	<p>The papers of the Guion family of Litchfield. Brothers Hobart Guion (1869-1950) and George Guion (1870-1962) married sisters Harriet Cutler McAllister (1880-1977) and Amelia Hamilton McAllister (1877-1962), respectively. The McAllister sisters were the nieces of New York social arbiter Samuel Ward McAllister, who coined the term &quot;the 400&quot; to describe, in his opinion, the elite New York society members who mattered.</p>
	<p>Hobart and George moved to Litchfield in 1907, purchasing the Barber property on Milton Road, where they raised horses and provided hauling and other services. The brothers were instrumental in the formation of the Litchfield Light Horse in 1915 and were active in the formation of the Litchfield Horse Show in the 1930s. They sold the farm in 1942. Hobart and George remained active in the state militia. George was also an artist who specialized in paintings of animals, such as dogs and horses.</p>
	<p>Amelia published short stories and poems in the early 1900s in such publications as Everybody&#039;s Magazine and Town and Country. Harper&#039;s Bazaar featured her in an April 28, 1900, article titled, &quot;Women Who Interest Us.&quot; During the 1920s and 1930s, Harriet and Amelia, billed as The McAllister Sisters, wrote and performed entertainments they called &quot;Duologues&quot; and &quot;Thumb Nail Comedies.&quot; Amelia also wrote poetry in the 1950s.</p>
	<p>Items include photographs of family members and subjects in and around Litchfield, a scrapbook related to the stagework of Amelia McAllister Guion and Harriet McAllister Guion, daily record books of Hobart Guion and George Guion (1907-1946), three notebooks of poetry and notes of Amelia McAllister Guion, and a document related to Litchfield Light Horse. The collection also includes documentation on the Litchfield Players (1925), &quot;Fashion Through the Years&quot; (1969), and a talk given by Mrs. Hobart Guion at the Litchfield Historical Society on her reminiscences of Litchfield (1965).</p>
	<p>An additional grouping of materials relates to George Guion&#039;s involvement with Litchfield Light Horse, the Litchfield Military Association, and the Connecticut State Guard, 1914-1961. These documents consist of receipts for military items, publications and ephemera, photographs, correspondence, and drawings. Other items include a letter and clipping from 1929 relating to Guion&#039;s painting of a dog; copies of memoranda on the Constitution and &quot;the stern determination to preserve &#039;States Rights&#039;&quot;; a letter related to the Litchfield Horse Show Association; four military manuals, three inscribed by George Guion (Basic Course for Cavalry, 1914; Cavalry Drill Regulations, 1911; Fundamentals of Military Service, 1916) and one inscribed by Harry F. Lynch (Field Service Regulations, United States Army, 1914); and one oversize recruiting poster for Litchfield Light Horse, Connecticut State Guard, circa 1943 [this poster currently stored in 18B2 shelf 5 box 12].</p>
