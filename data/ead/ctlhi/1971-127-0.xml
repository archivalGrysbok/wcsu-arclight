	<p>In 1797, Brewster moved to Cornwall, Conn., from Stratford, Conn., with his brother George and his mother Sarah Bentley Brewster. Her husband Peter Brewster had been lost at sea with his vessel, of which he was owner and captain, in 1793. Nelson Brewster was admitted to the county bar from Cornwall in 1824, lived two years in Litchfield, and then moved to Goshen where had a limited law practice.

They had two children, one of whom, William Root Brewster, rose to prominence in the Union Army during the Civil War. Nelson Brewster died in 1850.</p>
	<p>Included in the collection is a set of papers (23 items) related to the administration of Putnam Bailey&#039;s estate, 1840-1841. Bailey was a successful merchant and postmaster in North Goshen and left an estate of approximately $50,000. The estate required several years for settlement. The reports to Brewster as a bank commissioner are returns filed by Connecticut banks to the bank commissioners 1847-1848 and report their financial condition and their corporate stock organization. There is also a small account book relating to Brewster&#039;s bank commissioner work. The collection also contains the court record of Humphrey v. Humphrey (1811). This dispute involved the use of farm property. The connection to Brewster has not been determined. The rest of the documents pertain to minor criminal and civil offenses in Goshen, most involving Brewster as justice of the peace.</p>
