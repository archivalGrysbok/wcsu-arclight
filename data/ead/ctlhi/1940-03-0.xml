<bioghist altrender="Biographical Note" encodinganalog="545"><head>Biographical Note</head>
  <p>Adelaide Deming (1864-1956), born in Litchfield, was an artist and educator whose interest in her town&#039;s past provided subjects for many of her paintings. She was a descendant of a prominent Litchfield family of the post-Revolutionary War period, and a nationally known landscape painter. In addition to her art, Deming was involved in the issues of the day and in local affairs. She was president of the Litchfield Equal Franchise League. She was also one of the first presidents of the Women&#039;s Forum, a group still in existence. As a member of the town&#039;s board of education, she was credited with helping to bring a hot lunch program to the schools. She also pushed to get a new school built in the 1920s.</p>
