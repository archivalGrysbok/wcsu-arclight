	<head>Scope and Contents</head>
	<p>Research files and other materials related to Samuel Fisher&#039;s 1946 book, Litchfield Law School, 1774-1833: Biographical Catalogue, containing information about its students. There are also papers related to other aspects of Litchfield&#039;s history.</p>
	<p>Starting in the 1930s, Fisher undertook a project to assemble data on every student who attended the Litchfield Law School from 1774-1833. He conducted research and corresponded with colleges and universities, state libraries, historical societies, and other institutions across the country. He also employed genealogists to track down information. The results of his investigations were published in a book by the Yale Law School Library in conjunction with Yale University Press in 1946.</p>
	<p>The Litchfield Law School research records fill 4 document boxes and are filed in the following categories: Litchfield Law student research by states; individual student files; lists of students by college attended, occupation, and other criteria; copies of correspondence written by students; general correspondence; photographs of students; information about lectures and notebooks; and books and pamphlets relating to the Law School. There is much information not included in the 1946 book.</p>
	<p>An additional document box contains other materials that relates to Fisher&#039;s interest in Litchfield history. Among the topics covered: files related to Selleck Osborn and the Litchfield Witness, Uriah Tracy, and Elijah Hubbard; documentation on restoration of Phelps Tavern in the 1930s; and photographs and scripts relating to the Litchfield Players.</p>
