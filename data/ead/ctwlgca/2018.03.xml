<head>History</head>
<p>The Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. was founded in Wilton, Conn., in 1818 by Benjamin Gilbert (1788-1847). Benjamin Gilbert and his family initially used horsehair and other animal fibers to make sieves mounted on wooden hoops. Not long after Benjamin Gilbert expanded his business in 1826 to include the production of curled animal hair stuffing for mattresses and cushions, his son-in-law Sturges Bennett (1804-1880) joined the company. The company's first mill, the Old Red Shop, was purchased in Georgetown in 1830. From about 1834, the company began innovating with fine iron wire as a durable substitute for animal hair in its sieves. In these years, company growth was also driven by traveling salesmen, including Benjamin Gilbert's son William J. Gilbert (1814-1884) and son-in-law Edmund O. Hurlbutt (d. 1903). The last of the Gilbert family to head the company was the philanthropist Edwin Gilbert (1822-1906). Successive members of the Miller family then directed the company through 1953. Georgetown remained the administrative and manufacturing center of the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. through 1989, when all non-administrative operations shifted out-of-state. A few years later the administrative branch followed. The company declared bankruptcy in 1998.</p>
<p>The Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co.'s most famous product was wire window screening, first marketed at the start of the Civil War as an improvement upon the delicate cheese cloth formerly used to facilitate air circulation while still protecting against disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects. Improvements and variations on the original screening soon followed, including the substitution of steel for iron, galvanization, and the development of screening and fencing materials of different gauges, opening sizes, weaving patterns, and coating types, culminating in the twentieth century with vinyl and plastic coated products. </p>
<p>The history of the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. is intertwined with that of Georgetown. The upper and lower mills as well as the 1875 and 1906 office buildings of the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. were located in the center of Georgetown, effectively defining the character of the local community that grew and flourished around them. Prominent Georgetown buildings and institutions were provided by the company, including the Georgetown Post Office, the Gilbert Memorial Church, the Gilbert Farm, and the Gilbert &amp; Bennett School. In addition many local houses, such as those on Portland Avenue and Own Home Avenue, were produced by the company or built with the assistance of low-rate loans that the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. extended to their employees.</p>
