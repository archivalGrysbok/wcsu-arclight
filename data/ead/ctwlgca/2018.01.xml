<head>Biography</head>
<p>William Arthur Smith (1907-1991) was the son of Betty Hazel Fryer Smith (1887-1978) and Arthur Albin Smith (1882-1935), all lifelong Georgetown residents. William was a World War Two veteran, a paralegal, and a member of the Georgetown United Methodist Church, most notably serving as the church organist. Along with his siblings and mother, William was an active participant in local theater. He married Orpha Perkins Smith. </p>
<p>Betty Hazel Fryer Smith was William's mother. She was the daughter of William Robert Fryer (1856-1937) and Medora Batterson Bennett Fryer (1847-1919). Known as Hazel, she was a schoolteacher, a postmistress, and, after marriage, a newspaper journalist, besides being active in the Georgetown United Methodist Church and the Methodist Ladies Aid Society of Georgetown. She and her husband settled on West Church Street in Georgetown. Hazel's sister, who died young, was Edith Louise Fryer (1885-1899).</p>
<p>Arthur Albin Smith was William's father. He was the son of Marietta Albin Smith Sniffen (1861-1897) and William Smith. Arthur worked variously as a farm hand, a postman, a wire drawer at Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., and a painter. He was a member of the Georgetown Volunteer Fire Department, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, and was certified by the Connecticut Board of Examiners of Embalmers.</p>
<p>William's siblings were Edith Marie Smith (1909-2001), a lifelong Georgetown resident and manager and later vice-president at the Norwalk Savings Society; Ethel Louise Wellebil (1914-2001); and Elizabeth "Betty" Hazel Cowan (1922-2012), a graduate of the Methodist Hospital School of Nursing.</p>
