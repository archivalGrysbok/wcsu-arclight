<head>Biography</head>
<p>Louis P. Miller (1865-1949) was the son of Irish and English immigrants Catherine Wellin and Major David H. Miller, Sr., (1831-1915), a Civil War veteran, member of the Grand Army of the Republic, and president of the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. Joining the family business, Louis served as superintendent of Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., likely taking the post sometime during his father's (1906-1915) or his brother Samuel J. Miller's tenure as president (1915-1936). Louis was an active member of Georgetown's Ark Lodge, Connecticut Knights Templar.  </p>
<p>Olive Caroline "Carrie" Kennel Miller (1883-1979) was the daughter of Bertha Zimmer and German immigrant Jacob Kennel, a carpenter. As a young woman at the turn of the century, Carrie worked at the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., possibly as a wire weaver. After her husband Louis's death in 1949, she traveled extensively across North America and became a close friend and patron of Rolan S. Mattson, a local composer and designer, and his partner R. William "Bill" Stromberg.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Louis P. and Carrie Miller Collection contains papers and objects from the Miller's public and private lives. The bulk of the collection is made up of studio portraiture of family and friends, vacation snapshots, financial documents, Carrie's personal correspondence, and a large box of recipes. There is an extensive collection of greeting cards, travel postcards, and domestic travel brochures and paper ephemera (primarily relating to travel by automobile, railroad, and steamship in the 1940s and 1950s), as well as Carrie's travel diaries. Louis's involvement in the fraternal order of the Connecticut Knights Templar is well-documented. Only a few items relate to his father Major David H. Miller's membership in the Grand Army of the Republic, or to his own employment at the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. Finally, the collection includes a number of household objects and office desk equipment.</p>
