<head>History</head>
<p>European exploration and colonization of Connecticut began with the Dutch in the early 1600s, and British settlers arrived soon after. The Connecticut Colony joined the Union as a state in 1788. Early historical connections between Connecticut and the surrounding colonies, and later states, were maintained overland via carriage routes and, where possible, using the rivers. Seaports, however, were the major focus of trade. The industrial revolution improved Connecticut's interstate connections with steamboats on the larger navigable rivers and with railroads, which began laying down track between 1839 and the 1850s and had grown extensively to cover the region by the end of the century. Telephones and later automobiles augmented these earlier trends and brought them into the home by the early twentieth century, further facilitating the local and regional connections and activities of Georgetown residents.</p>
