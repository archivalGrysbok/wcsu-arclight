<head>Biography</head>
<p>Rolan S. Mattson (1920-1994) was the son of Mathias Maurits (1884-1970), a wire drawer at the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., and Esther (1891-1977) Mattson, both Finnish immigrants. Rolan's elder siblings were Norma, Gudrun, and Naomi; his younger siblings were Gloria, Gerald, Eva, and Constance. Rolan served in World War II as an Army Technician Fourth Grade; during his service he was put in charge of social and special events for his unit. Upon Rolan's return from the war, he became good friends with Olive Caroline "Carrie" Kennel Miller (1883-1979). Over the years Carrie also became Rolan's patron and landlord. By 1956, their friendship included joint vacations to Florida, accompanied by Rolan's partner R. William "Bill" Stromberg. Rolan's eventual home in Georgetown, a former carriage barn that he converted into a residence on Carrie's property, would be named "Villa Caroline" in her honor.</p>
<p>Rolan was a prolific poet, composer, and designer, as well as an enthusiastic painter and sketcher. He created his works at Studio One, a space rented from Carrie Miller. Beginning in about 1960, he began writing his most famous musical productions, A Georgetown Story, at Studio One. Around the same time and perhaps even earlier, he also offered his services as a custom milliner and women's fashion designer, designing for stars including Helen Hayes. At some point in the 1970s or 1980s, he operated the Mattson School of the Arts.</p>
<p>Within Georgetown, Rolan S. Mattson is remembered for his kindness, his many talents, his stylish parties, his patriotism, his affection for all things Scandinavian, and for hosting Loyalty Day Concerts with the U.S. Coast Guard Band for the community on his lawn, featuring a bandstand with famous headliners drawn from among his musical circle of friends.</p> 
<p>Ellen Ballon (1898-1969) was the daughter of Samuel Jacob, an industrialist, and Charlotte Ballon of Montreal, Canada. She was a child prodigy on the piano, attracting public notice by the age of 6. She studied at McGill University, New York City, and Vienna. As a student in New York in the 1920s through the early 1930s, Ellen lived with her sister Miriam and brother-in-law William Nevard in Westchester County. She continued on as a successful concert pianist, based out of Montreal, from the 1930s through the 1950s. Her apparent connection to Rolan S. Mattson is unclear; presumably it was through their shared love of music.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The bulk of the Rolan Mattson Collection is made up of sheet music, poetry, and lyrics for Rolan's numerous productions including, but not limited to, A Georgetown Story, The Wonderful Sounds of Christmas, The Bad Man, and The Front Page.</p>
<p>The many photographs in the collection include numerous portraits of Rolan Mattson, R. William "Bill" Stromberg, and Olive Caroline "Carrie" Kennel Miller, vacation snapshots, and professional photography of "Villa Caroline" and various events held there. Programs, guest lists, and other papers relating to concerts, parties, and other entertainments hosted, produced, or attended by Rolan Mattson are also prominent in the collection. </p>
<p>Rolan's correspondence includes letters and greeting cards exchanged with or relating to Olive Caroline "Carrie" Kennel Miller, as well as letters to and from various musical and acting celebrities, including June Havoc and Rosa Rio. Newspaper clippings relate to Rolan's social life as well as his cultural productions.</p>
<p>Items in the collection relating to Ellen Ballon include photographs and photograph albums, publicity materials from the 1940s, and a small amount of correspondence. Most notable is a photograph album from 1927, chronicling her first major European tour through Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and England. Two additional photograph albums are dated circa 1908 and circa 1916.</p>
