<head>Biography</head>
<p>Carl Haldor Johnson (b. ca. 1903) grew up in Georgetown on the Weston Road, where he lived with his Finnish immigrant parents, Olga Exenia and Carl A. Johnson. Several other close relatives lived in town: Gustav and Esther Johnson, Mathias Maurits Mattson (father of Rolan S. Mattson), and Frank Eliel and Anna R. Johnson. Gustav Johnson - either Carl Haldor's cousin or his uncle - was married to Mathias Maurits Mattson's sister. The family was employed by the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. Carl Haldor's father was a wire drawer and so was Maurits Mattson; Frank Eliel was a galvanizer; Carl Haldor started off a spool winder, but later found other employment first in the construction business and then in a hat factory.</p>
<p>Carl Haldor married Muriel Margaret Howard (b. 1909), a trained nurse, in 1937.</p>
