<head>History</head>
<p>Georgetown is a neighborhood located along the Norwalk River and partially within four separate townships: Wilton, Redding, Ridgefield, and Weston, Conn.</p>
<p>Residents of Fairfield, Conn., and select others began receiving land grants, known as the Fairfield long lots, in the Georgetown area as early as the 1720s, with the first confirmed house built in Georgetown in 1734. These early residents attended the Congregational Church in Redding, not having their own community church until as late as the 1780s. The land along the Norwalk River--which later became the center of Georgetown, encompassing Main Street and the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co.--was settled in the 1750s. Beginning in 1764, George Abbott's grist mill on the Norwalk River served the area. There may have been a saw mill at this site even earlier. Georgetown before the mid-1700s was not yet a single community but rather a loose collection of smaller localities, including Honey Hill, Sugar Street, and Osborntown. Local legend says the name Georgetown was only adopted sometime after the Revolutionary War.  </p>
<p>The Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. was founded in Georgetown in 1818. At that time and for the next few decades, the firm was only one of many manufacturing companies in the Georgetown area, many of which were powered by the Norwalk River. From the mid-1800s, however, Georgetown history and Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. history become inextricably linked. The company became the town's major employer and benefactor. After mid-century, it was also the primary driver of demographic change in Georgetown, increasingly attracting and hiring immigrants from Scandinavia, Poland, and Italy. Demographic change in turn added to and influenced the character of the town. By the late 1870s a Catholic congregation had formed, a Swedish congregational church was founded in 1889, and a Lutheran church followed soon after. </p>
<p>Several Georgetown institutions were founded within a decade or two of 1900, during the boom years of the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co. These include Connery Brothers Company (1882), the Gilbert &amp; Bennett School (1915), the Georgetown Post Office (1908), and the rental houses on Portland Avenue (1920-1925). These decades also saw the blossoming of community activities and activism, through increasing participation in social events and organizations, religious charities, and social reform movements. </p>
<p>The fortunes of Georgetown in the twentieth century have remained tied to the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., as the company suffered set-backs during the Great Depression, contributed to the war effort in the 1940s, weathered a disastrous flood in 1955, faced labor strikes in the 1970s, saw its campus added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, and declared bankruptcy in the 1990s. Following the Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co.'s departure from Georgetown between 1989 and 1998, the heavily polluted former mill site was evaluated by the EPA and clean-up and containment operations followed. The future of the site today--and with it a major component of Georgetown's history--remains uncertain.</p>
