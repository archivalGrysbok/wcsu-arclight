<head>Biography</head>
<p>The Avery family of Connecticut traces its American origins to Christopher Avery (circa 1616-1679) who settled in Gloucester, Massachusetts and relocated to Connecticut in 1665. </p>
<p>James Denison Avery was the Town Clerk of Groton, Connecticut in 1894. On Friday night, July 20, 1894, his house, the old Avery family homestead (referred to as the Hive of the Averys) was burned to the ground by the sparks from a passing train. The wave of nostalgia after the destruction of the homestead led to the formation of the Avery Memorial Association in 1894. James Denison Avery was the first President of the Association until his death on January 26, 1897.</p>
<p>The Association was incorporated in 1895 by a special act of the Connecticut legislature. The names on the Association's Charter are as follows: James D. Avery, Cyrus Avery, Christopher L Avery, Helen Avery of Groton, Allen Avery of Stonington and Elroy M Avery of Cleveland, Ohio. </p>
<p>The Hive homestead site by the railroad tracks was deeded to the Avery Memorial Association by James Denison Avery. A large obelisk-shaped monument was erected on the site. On Friday, July 20, 1900, the monument was dedicated. It is located at the corner of Poquonnock Hill Rd and U.S. Highway 1 in the town of Groton.  </p>
<p>The Ebenezer Avery House was built sometime in the 1750s by Parke Avery for his son Ebenezer. The house was used to shelter some of those wounded in the September 6, 1781 Battle of Groton Heights at Fort Griswold in Groton. In 1970, R. Stanton Avery of San Marino, California bought the house and gave it to the Association along with funds to help in the restoration. Ground was broken on June 23, 1971 to move the house from its original location at the corner of Thames and Latham Streets to the grounds of Fort Griswold State Park. The house itself was turned over to the State of Connecticut in a letter dated April 27, 1973 (signed by Governor Tom Meskill). Members of the Avery Memorial Association contributed 18th-century period furnishings, which the Association owns. The house was opened to the public on November 29, 1973.</p>
