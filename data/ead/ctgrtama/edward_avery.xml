<head>Biography</head>
<p>The Edward Avery Association represented a branch of the Groton Avery family and was founded at an 1896 Avery family reunion held at the Ledyard, Connecticut family homestead. Billings Theophilus Avery (October 17, 1856-November 27, 1946), then owner of the homestead, is credited as the EAA founder. The constitution stated that the association was formed to preserve the history, genealogy and traditions of the Edward Avery branch of the Avery family, Edward being one of the grandsons of Captain James Avery, who received a land grant in 1653 that included what is now Ledyard. Edward settled in this area and successive descendants occupied the homestead, which was the site of annual family reunions. Seventeen members were present at the last meeting of the EAA. At some point after 1916 the association ceased to be active, and its records became part of the Avery Memorial Association Archives. Billings Theophilus Avery is buried at the Avery Stoddard Cemetery in Ledyard. </p>
    <p>A book by Homer DeLois Sweet (https://archive.org/details/averysofgrotonge00swee), The Averys of Groton, 1894, provides information about the Edward Avery branch of the Groton Averys, including successive descendants who were owners of the Ledyard homestead:
Edward Avery (No. 13, page 30), Theophilus Avery (No. 35, page 35), James  (No. 119, page 54), Theophilus (No. 309, page 105), Billings (No. 801, Page 185), Theophilus (No. 1570, page 270), and Billings Theophilus (No. 2245, page 300). It also includes information about the association officers who were recorded as present at the last meeting: Billings T. Avery (No. 2245, page 300), president; Mrs. Helen Norman (No. 2246, page 270), vice-president; Irving J. Avery (No. 2248, page 270), secretary.</p>
