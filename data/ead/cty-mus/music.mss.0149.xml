         <head>Content Description</head>
         <p>This collection contains correspondence, company memos, and insurance documents. Also included are programs, biographical information, clippings and press releases - ostensibly collected by the insurance company archives. Of particular interest is Charles Ives' own life insurance policy, and training materials that Ives created for his employees.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Charles Ives and Julian Myrick met in 1899, while employed at Charles H. Raymond and Company, general agents for Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1907, Ives and Myrick started their own agency, Ives and Company, which later became Ives and Myrick, which was owned by Mutual Life Insurance Company.</p>
         <p>Ives held firm beliefs about the purpose and value of life insurance, about which he wrote a number of articles. Although Ives was rather reserved, he played an active role in training their agents. Ives and Myrick was a very successful agency, and its employees were fiercely loyal. Charles Ives retired from business in 1930.</p>
