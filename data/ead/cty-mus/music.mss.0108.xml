         <p>Danny Kaye (born David Daniel Kaminsky in 1913) ranks among the most talented and versatile stars of Broadway, Hollywood, radio and television; he was admired for his acting, singing, dancing, and comedy. His many films included <emph render="italic">The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Inspector General.</emph> He died in 1987.</p>
         <p>In 1940 Kaye married Sylvia Fine (1913-1991), a lyricist and composer. She wrote many of her songs for Kaye and helped manage his career, and she was a successful movie and TV producer in her own right.</p>
         <p>Fine and Kaye had one daughter, Dena Kaye.</p>
