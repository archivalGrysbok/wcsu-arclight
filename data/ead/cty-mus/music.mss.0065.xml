         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Primary source materials for most of Swift's musical compositions and writings constitute the most noteworthy and complete portion of the collection. These materials have been arranged into three series: Music, Scripts, and Writings. Series I, by far the largest, contains holograph and copyist's manuscripts for nearly all of Swift's theater compositions, individual songs, and instrumental projects. There are full orchestral scores for <emph render="italic">Alma Mater</emph>, <emph render="italic">One Little Girl</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Reaching for the Brass Ring</emph>. The collection also includes most of Swift's published sheet music, as well as music by other composers in Swift's possession at the time of her death.</p>
         <p>The collection is rich in drafts and proposals for theater projects. Series II, in addition to having scripts and lyrics sheets for the produced musicals, includes outlines, scripts, sketches, and lyrics for many unrealized projects, including <emph render="italic">A Candle for St. Jude</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sarah was There</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Here's the Pitch</emph>. Holograph scores and musical sketches for many of these projects are found in Series I.</p>
         <p>Series III contains Swift's writings. These include a number of autobiographical sketches, a novel entitled <emph render="italic">Then Welcome Each Rebuff</emph>, and a copy of her autobiographical novel <emph render="italic">Who Could Ask for Anything More?</emph> The series also includes writings done in collaboration and by others. There are two articles, for instance, by Swift's daughter Kay Levin, and an incomplete diary by her grandmother, Gertrude Horton Dorr Swift.</p>
         <p>Correspondence, financial and business records, programs, clippings, photographs, and miscellaneous items comprise the remainder of the collection. The correspondence dates mostly from the second half of her life. Swift claimed to have destroyed all of Gershwin's letters to her. There are a few letters from Ira Gershwin as well as letters from Johnny Mercer, Robert Russell Bennett, and Bing Crosby, to name a few. The clippings, too, date mostly the second half of Swift's life. The Music Library has added several important items to the collection, including a script from the Camp Fire Girls production of <emph render="italic">One Little Girl</emph>, photocopies of three original programs for Fine and Dandy, and photocopies of the songs that Swift wrote in 1935-36 for Radio City Music Hall, copied from the originals in the Radio City Music Hall archives.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Kay Swift (1897-1993) is known today primarily for her close association with George Gershwin. As a composer, however, she was a pioneer, producing scores for Broadway and the American Ballet at a time when few women wrote for the stage. Her music spans seven decades and ranges in style from highbrow to lowbrow. For the same work she could compose complex contrapuntal music one moment and a jazzy, popular melody the next. The Papers of Kay Swift at the Yale University Music Library document most of her creative activity, from the earliest period of her career until the end of her life.</p>
         <p>Born in New York City on April 19, 1897, Katharine Faulkner Swift was the daughter of Ellen Mary Faulkner and Samuel Swift, who was music critic at the <emph render="italic">New York Evening Mail</emph>. She received formal conservatory training in music, studying composition and piano with Arthur Edward Johnstone and Bertha Feiring Tapper, respectively, at the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School), and with Charles Martin Loeffler and Heinrich Gebhard at the New England Conservatory. (Leonard Bernstein would later also study with Gebhard.) With Percy Goetschius, Swift learned counterpoint and orchestration. As a performer Swift accompanied singers and instrumentalists, and toured with the Edith Rubell string trio.</p>
         <p>In 1918 Swift married the banker James P. Warburg, with whom she had three daughters: April, Kay, and Andrea. Although the marriage put an end to her performing activities, it launched her career as a Broadway composer. Warburg (using the pen name Paul James) and Swift collaborated on songs for interpolation into three Broadway revues: <emph render="italic">The First Little Show</emph> (1929), <emph render="italic">Garrick Gaieties</emph> (1930), and <emph render="italic">The Nine-Fifteen Revue</emph> (1930). The song "Can't We Be Friends" has been a favorite ever since Libby Holman first sang it to Clifton Webb in <emph render="italic">The First Little Show</emph>. The Swift-James collaboration reached its peak in 1930 with the opening of the hit musical <emph render="italic">Fine and Dandy</emph>, for which they wrote the complete score. It ran 255 performances, longer than <emph render="italic">Strike Up the Band</emph> (191 performances), one of Gershwin's two musicals of the same year.</p>
         <p>Swift's intimate relationship with George Gershwin began in 1925 and led to her divorce from Warburg. In 1937, two years after the divorce, Gershwin died in California of a brain tumor. Throughout her life, Swift was considered an invaluable source of knowledge about Gershwin and his music. She and Ira Gershwin used sketches for songs left unfinished by George to construct a score for the 20th Century Fox film <emph render="italic">The Shocking Miss Pilgrim</emph> (1946), which starred Betty Grable and Dick Haymes. Swift also helped to reconstruct Gershwin's music for posthumous publication and recordings. For example, she provided some of the harmonization for "The Union League" from the 1933 musical <emph render="italic">Let 'Em Eat Cake</emph>.</p>
         <p>In 1934 George Balanchine commissioned Swift to write a ballet about student life at Yale during the twenties. Morton Gould provided the orchestrations for the ballet called <emph render="italic">Alma Mater</emph>. (She made extensive revisions to the score in the early 1970s for a revival that never took place.) In 1935-36 Swift worked as a staff composer at Radio City Music Hall, collaborating on songs with lyricist Al Stillman. She served as supervisor of music for the 1939 New York World's Fair. At the Fair's rodeo exhibition she met her second husband, rancher Faye Hubbard. They spent their six-year marriage in Oregon raising Hubbard's two daughters and training stunt horses for Hollywood. In 1943 Swift published a fictional account of her experience as a rancher's wife, <emph render="italic">Who Could Ask For Anything More?</emph> RKO adapted the book for the 1950 film <emph render="italic">Never a Dull Moment</emph>, starring Irene Dunne and Fred MacMurray, with music by Swift herself.</p>
         <p>Swift's other full-length Broadway score was for <emph render="italic">Paris '90</emph> (1952), a showcase for Cornelia Otis Skinner about Parisian life in the late nineteenth century. This time Swift was her own lyricist. Orchestrations were by Robert Russell Bennett, who had orchestrated several of Gershwin's musicals.</p>
         <p>Throughout the 1950s Swift remained active both as a composer and a Gershwin expert. She wrote songs and incidental music for Marc Connelly's play <emph render="italic">Hunter's Moon</emph>, which opened and quickly closed in London in 1958. One song from the play, "Look Skyward," was published separately by Chappell. In 1959 Samuel Goldwyn hired Swift for a national lecture tour to promote the film version of <emph render="italic">Porgy and Bess</emph>. Swift later wrote about her experiences on the road.</p>
         <p>In the 1960s Swift received numerous commissions for a variety of projects developed and coordinated by Alfred Stern, whom she had first met at Radio City in the 1930s. The first of these came from the Camp Fire Girls Association for the composition of <emph render="italic">One Little Girl</emph>, a musical commemorating the organization's golden anniversary. Hans Spialek, orchestrator for both <emph render="italic">Fine and Dandy</emph> and <emph render="italic">The First Little Show</emph>, did the orchestrations. In 1962 she was commissioned to write the music for the Century 21 Exposition in Seattle. She also provided the scores for the Borden Company's exhibition <emph render="italic">All About Elsie</emph> and the Clairol Pavilion at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. (The former had a script by Joel Oliansky, then Playwright-in-Residence at Yale.) For the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976, the American Medical Association engaged her to write music for their presentation <emph render="italic">Dr. Rush Pays a House Call</emph>.</p>
         <p>Swift also wrote instrumental works (for example a Theme and Variations for piano and 'cello for Marie Rosanoff) and many individual songs based on texts by a variety of writers, including Ursula Vaughan Williams and Swift's daughters Andrea Kaufman and April Gigliano. The most celebrated of these works is <emph render="italic">Reaching for the Brass Ring</emph>, a song cycle in honor of her grandchildren. The Philadelphia Orchestra first performed the cycle in 1953.</p>
         <p>With various collaborators, including her third and last husband, Hunter Galloway, Swift created numerous proposals and song sketches for stage and television musicals. She collaborated with Robert Lewis Taylor on a show about the life of Bobby Clark, with Rumer Godden on a musical adaptation for her novel <emph render="italic">A Candle for St. Jude</emph>, and with Deems Taylor on <emph render="italic">Spring Again</emph>, for which she set lyrics to music by Puccini. Unfortunately, none of these projects ever reached the stage.</p>
         <p>Swift also arranged music by other composers. She made a chorus arrangement of "Aquarius" from the rock musical <emph render="italic">Hair</emph>. She was in her seventies at the time. She arranged Gershwin's "Yankee Doodle Blues" for Eva Jessye, the chorus director for the original <emph render="italic">Porgy and Bess</emph>. For the wedding of her granddaughter Katharine Kaufman Weber, she made a flute and trombone arrangement of a bourrée by Bach.</p>
         <p>A musical tribute to Kay Swift was held in New York at Merkin Concert Hall on October 14, 1986. The concert was hosted by William Bolcom and featured Julie Wilson, Joan Morris, and Steve Ross. Swift herself performed two piano works, "For Betsy," written in memory of her granddaughter killed in a car accident, and "Keep On Keeping On," her last known composition. She died in Southington, Connecticut on January 28, 1993.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series includes manuscript and printed music by Kay Swift and composers with whom she was associated personally or professionally. The music is divided into six subseries: Subseries A-C are distinguished by genre; Subseries D comprises Kay Swift's unidentified sketches; and Subseries E and F consist of music by other composers. Kay Swift's musical works are ordered alphabetically; Subseries E and F are ordered first by composer and then by title of composition.</p>
               <p>Uniform titles are used to bring together all manifestations of a work with different titles. For multiple-part works, full or partial scores appear first, followed by other versions of individual compositions in different formats. In some cases (i.e. Paris '90) cross references are present between parts of a work and pieces that are included with another work.</p>
               <p>Where identification is possible, sketches for each composition are kept with the completed music for a given project. The unidentified sketches in Subseries D are arranged by genre.</p>
               <p>Scripts, outlines, project proposals, and lyric sheets for the musical works can be found in Series II. In addition, Series IV contains project folders for many of these works. Boxes and folders are numbered consecutively throughout the series.</p>
               <p>Additional music composed and arranged by Kay Swift during her tenure as a staff composer at Radio City Music Hall (1935-36) may be found in Addendum 1 of this register (pp. 228-234).</p>

                     <p>Both incomplete: Fine and Dandy lacks all after p. 11, Can This Be Love? all after p. 8.</p>
                     <p>Arr. for: voice, piano, double bass, and percussion.</p>
                     <p>Parts for double bass only, some inconsistent with score.</p>
                     <p>Parts are holograph in pencil and ink, annotations in ink and pasted in.</p>
                     <p>Note on last page of 1 part: Homer: After this chorus, the rest is a pizz. accomp. to a sung chorus, probably in E-flat. Any suggestion as to key for you being changed, or preference as to pizz. over arco will be welcomed Kay Tempo is approx. 108=[half note], but not any faster.</p>

               <p>This series includes holograph and typed scripts, outlines, proposals, notes, and lyrics for theater, song, and unidentified projects. Many of these projects were never realized, and a few did not involve Kay Swift. Projects are arranged alphabetically by title, and in each case single lyrics and miscellaneous notes come at the end of a project heading. A full script of One Little Girl (13/409), obtained directly from the Camp Fire Girls Association, has been added to the original donation of the papers. The series ends with 155 unidentified or miscellaneous lyrics. Project files corresponding to some of the realized projects may be found in Series IV. Severely aged or damaged pages have been copied onto acid-free paper.</p>

               <p>This series consists of personal and professional correspondence to and from Kay Swift. Letters are either typescript or manuscript and include drafts and carbon copies. The majority of correspondence dates from the 1950s onward, although there are some letters from earlier decades. Letters are arranged alphabetically by correspondent, then chronologically. Additional correspondence directly related to theatrical projects is located in Series V under project title. Cross references to the project folders have been included in this series for individual correspondents of particular importance. Severely aged or damaged pages have been copied onto acid-free paper.</p>

               <p>This series is divided into four subseries: A. Programs involving Kay Swift; B. Programs involving others; C. Press releases and publicity; D. Clippings. Subseries A and B are arranged alphabetically by title. Photocopies of three programs of Fine and Dandy (22/628) have been added to the original donation of the papers. Subseries C is also arranged by title, while the clippings in Subseries D are arranged chronologically by year, with undated clippings at the end. All clippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper, and the originals have been discarded.</p>

               <p>This series consists of photocopies of music by Kay Swift from the Archives of Radio City Music Hall. The music dates from Swift's tenure as a staff composer at Radio City during the years 1935 and 1936. Included are both music newly-composed for Radio City and arrangements of songs which were also used in Swift's other theatrical projects.</p>
               <p>The music is arranged in the order it was received from Radio City. The four-digit numbers stamped on the original scores, reproduced on the photocopies, and transcribed in the register represent the numbering system in the Radio City Archives. Whenever dates appear they indicate the presence of pages photocopied from the program for that week's Radio City production.</p>
               <p>All materials in this addendum to the Kay Swift Papers were provided to the Yale University Music Library through a special contractual agreement with Radio City Music Hall Productions. The Radio City materials may be used for scholarship and research; however, all other uses must be cleared through Radio City.</p>
