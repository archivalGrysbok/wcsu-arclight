         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Benny Goodman was born in Chicago, May 30, 1909. He received his first musical training at a local synagogue, and later studied clarinet with Franz Schoepp. Goodman made his debut at the age of twelve, and left home to become a full-time professional clarinetist when he was sixteen.</p>
         <p>After a decade of performing as a free-lancer and as a member of Ben Pollak's band, Goodman established his first big band in 1934, and soon it achieved unprecedented success. He won great acclaim both for his dazzling clarinet solos and for the brilliance of his band. In an era of segregation, Goodman was a pioneer in hiring without regard to race; his ensemble included outstanding black musicians (such as Teddy Wilson) as well as leading white performers (such as Gene Krupa). Goodman also employed talented arrangers, including Fletcher Henderson, Eddie Sauter, and many others. At his peak, in the late 1930s, Goodman may have been the most popular musician in the world. His Carnegie Hall concert on January 16, 1938 is regarded as a key moment in jazz history.</p>
         <p>Goodman did not restrict himself to big band music; he also won renown for his work with a series of small combos that included Wilson, Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Charlie Christian, and other prominent jazz musicians. He even pursued a classical career, performing clarinet concertos with numerous orchestras and playing chamber music with ensembles such as the Budapest String Quartet. He commissioned major works from Bela Bart'k, Aaron Copland, Paul Hindemith, and other composers.Although the swing era eventually passed, Goodman retained a large and loyal following, even as bop, rock, and other musical styles came into vogue. He and his band performed widely, not only in the United States, but also in Latin America, Europe, the Soviet Union, and East Asia. Over the course of his long career, Goodman made innumerable recordings and appeared frequently on radio, television, and film. His life and music have been the subject of many biographies, discographies, and other studies.</p>
         <p>Benny Goodman died in New York on June 13, 1986. Years after his passing, he remains the unchallenged 'King of Swing.'</p>
