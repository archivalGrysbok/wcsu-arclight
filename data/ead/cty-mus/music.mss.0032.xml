         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The bulk of the Horatio Parker Papers was a gift from his wife, Anna Ploessl Parker, four years after his death. Eva J. O'Meara (Music Librarian at Yale, 1924-1952) writes: "Mrs. Parker, when she was about to leave New Haven in 1923, brought to Sprague Hall all the manuscripts left in Dr. Parker's possession at the time of his death. They were accepted as a gift to Yale University for the Library of the School of Music, and were formally acknowledged by the University Librarian in a letter of April 25, 1923. There were among them a few manuscripts that Mrs. Parker wished to be given to other persons or institutions; they were sent out as she desired." A preliminary arrangement of this gift was done by Miss O'Meara with the help of a few of the faculty members of the School of Music.</p>
         <p>The remainder of the collection includes: a gift of two boxes of items from Mr. and Mrs. George Herbert Semler (1980 Oct 25); a gift of a few items from Isabel S. Curtis (1981 Aug); the purchase-of a scrapbook belonging to Thomas Dwight Goodell (1977/78); and several items which were transferred from the Yale University Library and from the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (1982 Mar). Any items which are not part of Mrs. Parker's initial gift have their provenance indicated on the item and/or folder. The greater part of the papers is comprised of musical works by Parker. There is a broad range of genres including: Choral Works; Opera and Incidental Music; Songs and Other Vocal Works; Anthems and Services; Keyboard Works; Orchestral and Chamber Music; and Miscellaneous Works. The music includes holographs as well as manuscripts in other hands and published works. The remainder of the papers contains correspondence, program, clippings, writings by Parker, biographical information, and miscellaneous items. There are occasionally cross-references between series.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Horatio Parker was born in Auburndale, Massachusetts, on September 15, 1863. He took composition lessons with George Whitefield Chadwick in Boston, and then completed his training with three years of study at the Hochschule für Musik in Munich, where Josef Gabriel Rheinberger was numbered among his teachers. After his return to the United States in 1885, Parker held a series of positions as a teacher and church musician.</p>
         <p>In 1894 Parker became the Battell Professor of the Theory of Music at Yale University. His appointment and his growing reputation both owed much to the great success of his oratorio <emph render="italic">Hora Novissima</emph>, which received its first performance in New York in 1893, and quickly achieved renown throughout the United States. In 1899, Parker's fame crossed the Atlantic with the performance of <emph render="italic">Hora Novissima</emph> at the Three Choirs Festival in Worcester, England. Cambridge University awarded Parker an honorary doctorate in 1902.</p>
         <p>In New Haven Parker continued to distinguish himself as a composer, teacher, conductor, organist, administrator, and writer. He became the first Dean of the Yale School of Music in 1904. Parker was the founding conductor of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, and he directed two other New Haven organizations as well: the New Haven Oratorio Society and the Euterpe Society. In addition to his university courses on music theory, he lectured and wrote on music history at Yale and elsewhere.</p>
         <p>Parker composed two operas, both with librettos by his former Yale colleague Brian Hooker. <emph render="italic">Mona</emph>won the Metropolitan Opera Prize for the best American opera in 1911 and was produced at the Met in 1912. <emph render="italic">Fairyland</emph>won the prize offered by the Women's Federated Musical Clubs and was performed in Los Angeles in 1914.</p>
         <p>Parker died in Cedarhurst, New York on December 18, 1919. His legacy lived on in his many students. Yale holds the papers of several of them, including Charles Ives, David Stanley Smith (Parker's successor as Dean of the School of Music), and Quincy Porter.</p>

               <p>This series is divided into seven subseries (A-G) by genre. An index at the end of this register gives access by title. Cross-references have been made from parts of works to the title under which they are described. Transcription of the title page is given only when it contains information not stated in the uniform title. The first entry under a uniform title contains the fullest description. The date is noted only in the first entry unless it varies. Many of the published works were previously catalogued, and any cards containing extra information have been laid in with their respective works. The term "bis", beside an opus number in a uniform title, is taken from the old cataloging where it was used to distinguish items with the same opus number. Subseries A-F are arranged alphabetically by title. The subseries G (Miscellaneous Works) is divided into: Copybooks, School songbooks, Sketches, Works by others arranged by Parker, Works by others, Librettos and texts, Lists of Parker's works and discographies, and Sound recordings of Parker's works; the works are arranged alphabetically by composer or title under these broad headings. The term "holograph" as used in the section entitled "Works by others arranged by Parker" refers to Parker's hand.</p>
               <p>The location of an item appears in the column on the left. A shelf number of the form "capital letter/op. no." (e.g. L/op.84d) denotes a bound volume. Unbound items are arranged in boxes according to size, with shelf numbers of the form "Box no./folder no." (e.g. Box 2/10).</p>

               <p>This series contains newspaper and magazine clippings concerning Parker. All have been photocopied onto acid-free paper and the originals were not kept. There are five subseries: A. Parker's Works and Performances, arranged alphabetically by title of work, then chronologically; B-D, arranged chronologically within each subseries; and E. Scrapbooks. The last subseries is a microfilm of six scrapbooks. A paper copy was made from the microfilm, and the articles are distributed in their appropriate subseries. A red star and the number of the scrapbook in which it appears are on the copies. If a clipping was found with an item such as a letter, a note has been added to the clipping and the item.</p>
