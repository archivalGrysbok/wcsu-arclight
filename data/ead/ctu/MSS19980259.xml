            <head>History</head>
            <p>The Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs assists the Vice President for Academic Affairs at the University of Connecticut. The Vice President for Academic Affairs, formerly and currently the Provost , was the chief academic officer of the University and reported directly to the University President. The Office of the Provost was established in 1950 when the Provost assumed the functions of the Dean of the University. In 1975, the Office of the Provost was abolished and its functions were assigned to the new Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President of Finance and Administration.</p>
            <p>The office is responsible for university matters pertaining to academic activities and policy, including jurisdiction over the various schools, as well as faculty and student matters. In addition, the office is responsible for the daily internal operations of the University Senate and the Board of Trustees. In the 1990s, these responsibilities were reorganized and the office designated as the Chancellor and Provost for University Affairs. While the title of Chancellor has since been dropped, the Provost is also the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. Additional information on the responsibilities of the Office is available at:

            <p>Born in 
                <geogname>Dayton, Ohio</geogname>, David Carter was raised by his mother and his three older brothers. He earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from 
                <corpname>Central State University</corpname> in Ohio, an M.Ed. degree in curriculum and supervision from 
                <corpname>Miami (Ohio) University</corpname>, and a Ph.D. in educational development and educational administration from 
                <corpname>Ohio State University</corpname>. David Carter’s career as a professional educator spans 45 years, beginning in 
                <geogname>Ohio</geogname> and, since 1977, in Connecticut. He became the fifth president of 
                <corpname>Eastern Connecticut State University</corpname> on April 2, 1988, and was the first African-American president of a four-year institution of higher education in 
                <geogname>Connecticut</geogname>. He served as president for nearly 18 years, leading Eastern from a small university into a thriving academic institution with newly constructed first-rate facilities attracting a dynamic residential population from across the state, now designated as Connecticut’s public liberal arts university. He spent 11 years at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> before becoming the President of 
                <corpname>ECSU</corpname>, and served as a professor of educational administration and associate dean in the School of Education, in addition to serving as associate vice president for academic affairs. Before joining the faculty at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>, he was an associate professor in the college of education at 
                <corpname>Pennsylvania State University</corpname>.</p>
