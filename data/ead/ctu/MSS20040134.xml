            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>
                <persname>Hans Wilhelm</persname> was born in 
                <geogname>Bremen, Germany</geogname> shortly after the end of the second World War. He later attended art and business school in 
                <geogname>Germany</geogname> before moving to 
                <geogname>South Africa</geogname> where he began his career in illustrating, writing, and art. Wilhelm traveled throughout the world before finally settling in the 
                <geogname>United States</geogname>, at which point he began to write and illustrate hundreds of children's books. Wilhelm has written several series of popular children's books, to include those about the soccer playing bunny, Ralph, the vulnerable dinosaur, Boland, and the mean spirited Tyrone, from whom he teaches children solutions to the problem of being bullied. In addition to writing his books Wilhelm also illustrates his stories, many of which have been translated into dozens of foreign languages. When not writing Wilhelm can often be found visiting schools and libraries, showing children how he writes his books, sharing new stories, and helping children write and illustrate their own stories. 
                <persname>Hans Wilhelm</persname> lives in 
                <geogname>Westport, Connecticut</geogname>.</p>
