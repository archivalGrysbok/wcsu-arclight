<p>Fillipo (Phil) Dominic Antonucci, son of Pasquale and Mary of West Hartford, Connecticut, was born and attended local schools before joining the Army Air Corps in 1939.  He played the trumpet in the Army band while training as a pilot at Harding Field in Louisiana and was commissioned at Luke Field (Glendale, Arizona).</p><p>Lt. Antonucci served in the European theater during World War II and was reported missing in action on 4 October 1944 when he failed to return from a dive bombing mission over Landau, Germany.  His P47 fighter was last seen near St. Avold, France, when his flight was broken up by heavy flak.  The War Department notified his family of an official finding of death on 5 October 1945.</p>  </bioghist>
