         <head>Biography</head>
         <p>
            <persname>Daniel Yankelovich</persname>, noted social researcher and  public opinion analyst, was born in 1924 in <geogname>Boston, Massachusetts</geogname>.  He earned both his bachelor's degree (1946) and M.A.(1950) from <corpname>Harvard University</corpname>.  Post-graduate studies at the <corpname>Sorbonne</corpname> in Paris led  Yankelovich to embark upon an academic career.  He also holds honorary  doctorates from <corpname>Washington University</corpname> and <corpname>George Washington University</corpname> largely for his work  in the public sector.</p>
         <p>Yankelovich taught as a Research Professor of Psychology at <corpname>New York University</corpname> (1968-1973) and a Professor of Psychology in the Graduate Faculty of the <corpname>New School for Social Research</corpname> (1973-1978). In 1981 the <corpname>University of California at Irvine</corpname> named him a Distinguished Scholar.  In 1996 Yankelovich served as a Senior Fellow at the <corpname>Harvard University Kennedy School of Government</corpname> and currently lectures as a Visiting Professor at the <corpname>University of California at San Diego</corpname>.</p>
         <p>In 1958 Yankelovich temporarily departed academia to found the marketing and research firm <corpname>Daniel Yankelovich, Inc.</corpname>, which was renamed in 1974 to <corpname>Yankelovich, Skelly, &#x0026; White, Inc.</corpname>  He chaired this company from  1958-1986.  In 1976, joining former U.S. Secretary of State <persname>Cyrus Vance</persname>, he founded the <corpname>Public Agenda Foundation</corpname>, a nonprofit organization intended "to find and test new ways to present complex public issues."  Yankelovich  subsequently created the <corpname>New York Times/Yankelovich Poll</corpname> in the mid-1970s, which evolved into the <corpname>New York Times/CBS Poll</corpname>.  He serves as the chairman of <corpname>DYG, Inc.</corpname> which he established in 1986. Yankelovich has held directorships at firms such as <corpname>CBS, Inc.</corpname>, <corpname>Loral Corporation</corpname>, <corpname>Meredith Corporation</corpname>, <corpname>Reliance Group Holdings</corpname> and <corpname>U.S. West, Inc.</corpname>, among others.  He has served as a trustee at the <corpname>Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education</corpname>, the <corpname>Charles F. Kettering Foundation</corpname>, <corpname>Brown University</corpname>, and other institutions and organizations. </p>
         <p>Mr. Yankelovich has authored nine books in addition to hundreds of speeches and articles.  His books include, <title render="italic">Beyond the Beltway: Engaging the Public in U.S. Foreign Policy</title> (1994), <title render="italic">Coming to Public Judgment: Making Democracy Work in a Complex World</title> (1991), <title render="italic">Starting with the People</title> (1988), <title render="italic">New Rules: Searching for Self-fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down</title> (1981), and <title render="italic">Ego and Instinct: The Psychoanalytic View of Human Nature-Revised</title>  (1969).</p>
         <p>Mr. Yankelovich has a daughter, Nicole, through his first marriage to <persname>Hassie Kaboolian</persname>. In 1991 he wed <persname>Mary Komarnicki</persname>,  who also worked in the social  research/public opinion field after earning a master's degree in Social  Ecology from <corpname>St. Bonaventure University</corpname> in 1983.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The <persname>Daniel Yankelovich</persname> Papers document the  career of a noted scholar, social researcher and public opinion analyst  from  roughly 1955 to 1994.  The collection consists primarily of  research and draft material for three books, <title render="italic">Coming to Public Judgment: Making Democracy Work in a Complex World</title> (1991), <title render="italic">Starting with the People</title> (1988), <title render="italic">New Rules: Searching for Self-fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down</title> (1981), and  numerous survey projects, such as "The Public, the Soviets, and Nuclear  Arms".  Although the majority of the public opinion material covers  political life, a wide variety social issues receive attention as well.   The papers also chronicle Yankelovich's participation in numerous  organizations and the involvement of his second wife, <persname>Mary Komarnicki Yankelovich</persname>, in public opinion analysis.  </p>

         <head>Organization</head>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Series I: Writings</emph> (1947-1992) houses the various writings and related materials of Yankelovich.  The series has been broken down into the following subseries: <emph render="italic">Articles</emph>, <emph render="italic">Books</emph>, <emph render="italic">Other Writings</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Presentations</emph>.  The <emph render="italic"> Articles</emph> subseries contains copies of a number of Yankelovich's  many newspaper and journal articles.  In some cases there is additional  material, such as notes or fan mail.  The <emph render="italic">Books</emph> subseries includes varying amounts of r esearch material, drafts, reviews, and miscellaneous material for the  three books <title render="italic">Coming to Public Judgment: Making Democracy Work in a Complex World</title> (1991), <title render="italic">New Rules: Searching for Self-fulfillment in a World Turned Upside Down</title> (1981), and <title render="italic">Starting with the People</title> (1988).  Interviews for the <title render="italic">New Rules</title> book have been restricted until 1/1/  2009.  The material for each book has been typically arranged in order  of creation. Documents from the Abrams Lecture Series and the New  Framework Group are in this subseries because of their relation to the  books.  The <emph render="italic">Other Writings</emph> subseries  contains copies of odd materials such as reports and book chapters.  The <emph render="italic">Presentations</emph> subseries encompasses  material associated with the many speeches, discussions, and conference  presentations given by Yankelovich. Not all folders contain copies of  the presentation text.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Series II: Projects</emph> (1949-1994) showcases the materials associated with several major survey projects.  The series is broken down into several broad subject categories, such as, <emph render="italic">Harvard Business Review Projects</emph>, <emph render="italic">Nuclear Policy Projects</emph>, <emph render="italic">Work Projects</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Youth Projects</emph>.

For the  most part, the materials include meeting agenda books and reports, but  in some cases include a wider range of documents.  The series is  arranged alphabetically by institution name. </p>
         <p/>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Series IV: Subject Files</emph> (1965- 1992) contains source material associated with subjects of interest to  Yankelovich, such as education, politics and government, and polls.   The documents consist primarily of books, reports, and papers.  A  collection of <corpname>Harris Surveys</corpname> and <corpname>Business Week/Harris Polls</corpname> from 1975- 1988 (with  some gaps) may prove of particular interest to researchers.   The  series is arranged alphabetically by subject.</p>

         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Series V: Related Material </emph> (1959-1991) encompasses a wide range of papers not related directly with the material in the other series.

A  clippings scrapbook covering the period from 1959-1969 comprises one  highlight of this series.  The series is arranged alphabetically by  general subject headings.</p>
         <p/>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Series VI: Mary Komarnicki Yankelovich</emph> (1937-1993) holds the material created by or belonging to Mary Komarnicki.
