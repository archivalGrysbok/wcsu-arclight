            <p>The Women's Center at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> was formed in 1972 after many years of active petitioning by students and faculty. The center was established through the initiative of the Free Women's Collective, and was initially set up in the Bishop Center under the Continuing Education for Women's program. The Women's Center participated in affirmitive action, discrimination, and accessible facilities debates on campus, and helped to bring numerous women's collectives together. These collectives were later consolidated into other organizations on campus, such as the Rape Crisis Collective which became the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. The center has served the needs of a diverse cross section of students on campus, and has provided counseling services, operated crisis centers, and brought awareness to numerous issues facing gay, African American, and divorced students, in addition to helping the victims of discrimination, assault, and rape. The Women's Center continues to educate members of the university, as well as the community at large, about different forms of oppression through community organization, interaction, and education.
