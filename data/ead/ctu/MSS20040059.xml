            <p>
                <persname>David A. Katz</persname>, born in 1949 in Miami, Florida, is an artist and children's book illustrator. Katz's artistic training began under the tutelage of 
                <persname>Duane Hanson</persname>, and 
                <persname>Salvador LaRosa</persname>. Katz graduated with a Masters in Art from the 
                <geogname>University of South Florida </geogname>.</p>
            <p>Various artistic movements are evident in Katz's work and include German Expressionism, Fauvism, and Pop Art. Additionally, Katz also found inspiration from several artists including 
                <persname>Paul Klee</persname> and 
                <persname>Andy Warhol. </persname></p>
            <p>Katz's work has been selected for numerous film festivals including the Anima Mundi in Brazil, the Chicago Internatiuonal Animation Festival, the New York International Film Festival, and the AIVF DV Expo in Los Angeles. Katz's film 
                <title render="italic">Cartoon Sea</title> was selected for worldwide viewing by Film Aid, in association with the United Nations and has been used as an interstitial on PBS. David Katz's 
                <title render="italic">Cartoon Consciousness</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Embryo</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">Mega One</title> have been acquired by the Mississippi Museum of Art, the USF Contemporary Art Museum, and the Bass Museum of Art for their permanent collections. Additionaly, Katz has recently been asked to be part of the Canal Street Projection Project. The event is part of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce arts program.</p>
            <p>David Katz has illustrated a total of fourteen books. As a children's book illustrator, Katz uses digital technology to produce exciting new visuals. Some of his most noted work has been done with his wife 
                <persname>Judith Love Cohen</persname>, a space engineer and children's book author, who writes books to inspire young girls and teach them that the 'sky is the limit' in terms of their careers. Katz's illustrations compliment and complete Cohen's books for young women including
