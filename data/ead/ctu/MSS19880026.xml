            <head>History</head>
            <p>In April 1881, the Connecticut General Assembly established the Storrs Agricultural School after accepting a gift of 170 acres of land, several frame buildings, and money from Charles and Augustus Storrs. The School opened on 28 September 1881, with twelve students in the first class. Before the turn of the century there were two name changes (Storrs Agricultural College1893, Connecticut Agricultural College1899). In 1933, two years after the institution celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, it became Connecticut State College, a name more in keeping with its steady advances and broadened mission. Six years later, in 1939, the General Assembly designated the institution the University of Connecticut, an acknowledgment of the institution's developing importance to the State in graduate and professional education, research and public service.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection contains ephemeral and artifactual materials created, collected, utilized, worn and/or associated primarily with students in conjunction with their experiences at or with the University of Connecticut. The collection by no means completely documents activities at the institution since its establishment, but the materials do provide balance and depth to the understanding of student life and college experiences when utilized in conjunction with the official University administrative records.</p>
