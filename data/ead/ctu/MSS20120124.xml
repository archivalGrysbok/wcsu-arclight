            <p>The collection contains the papers of Dr. 
                <persname>Arthur W. Fanta</persname>. The papers are mostly biographical in nature, including two obituaries, a speaker pamphlet, and a two page typed biography. There are also a number of photographs of Fanta and his wife, Dr. 
                <persname>Ruth Roscoe Fanta</persname>, possibly taken during their time in 
                <geogname>Germany</geogname>. The collection also contains a map of 
                <geogname>Czechoslovakia</geogname>, where Fanta was born, showing major cities and connecting roadways. A large portion of the collection is Fanta’s copies of the International Military Tribunal’s indictment against the major Nazi War Criminals, a reflection of his work at the Nuremberg War Trials from 1945-1948. There is no additional documentation of his work at the Nuremberg Trials in this collection.</p>

            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Dr. 
                <persname>Arthur W. Fanta</persname> was born in 
                <geogname>Broumov, Bohemia</geogname> (
                <geogname>Czech Republic</geogname>), on August 1, 1893. He received his doctorates of law and philosophy from the 
                <corpname>University of Prague</corpname> and the 
                <corpname>University of Vienna</corpname>. After serving in the Austrian Army during the First World War, Fanta practiced international and industrial law in 
                <geogname>Karlsbad, Czechoslovakia</geogname>. He also served as the Legal Advisor to the Social Democratic Party in 
                <geogname>Czechoslovakia</geogname>. Because of this affiliation and his political activities against the Nazi Party, Fanta was forced to flee to 
                <geogname>England</geogname> in 1939. He remained in 
                <geogname>England</geogname> during the war and was employed for two years by the British Ministry of War as a Lecturer for the British Army.</p>
            <p>In 1945, Fanta became a U.S. War Department employee, acting as one of the prosecutors and trial attorneys in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. He was involved in the prosecution of 
                <persname>Hans Lammers</persname>, chief of the Reich Chancellery, and the interrogation of Gauleiter 
                <persname>Ernst Bohle</persname>, leader of Nazi activity outside of 
                <geogname>Germany</geogname>. While working on the trials, Fanta met the American 
                <persname>Ruth Roscoe</persname>. They married in 1948 and moved to the 
                <geogname>United States</geogname> later that year. While living in the United States, Fanta taught at 
                <corpname>Trinity College</corpname> in 
                <geogname>Hartford, Connecticut</geogname>, the 
                <corpname>University of Hartford</corpname>, and the 
                <corpname>University of Pennsylvania</corpname>. He was also a research associate and statistician with the State Department of Labor. Fanta died on July 9, 1963 at the age of 69.</p>
