<abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract:">The Meriden &#x0026; Cromwell Railroad ran between these two cities in 
Connecticut from 1885 to 1888 when its name changed to the Meriden, Waterbury &#x0026; Connecticut River Railroad, and was 
extended to Waterbury, Connecticut, until 1892, when the line was taken over by the New York &#x0026; New England Railroad.  
The Album, compiled by James M.S. Ullman of Meriden, Connecticut, has 185 photographs of locomotives, stations, and other 
scenes associated with these railroad lines.	</abstract>

	<head>History</head>
	<p>Building for the <corpname>Meriden &#x0026; Cromwell Railroad</corpname> began in 1883, when a dormant charter, granted 
in 1871, was revived by manufacturers in the town of <geogname>Meriden, Connecticut</geogname>.  When the line was completed 
in 1885 it ran from Center Street in <geogname>Meriden, Connecticut</geogname>, to a point in <geogname>Cromwell, 
Connecticut</geogname>, on the <geogname>Connecticut River</geogname>.  It was soon proposed to extend the line 
to <geogname>Waterbury, Connecticut</geogname>, and in 1887, with subscriptions of stock from the citizens of Waterbury, building commenced.  It was completed in July 1888 and the name of the railroad line changed to the <corpname>Meriden, Waterbury &#x0026; Connecticut River Railroad</corpname>. By 1889 the line owned five locomotives, seven passenger cars and 154 freight cars. </p>
<p>In October 1892 the MW&#x0026;CR became part of the <corpname>New York &#x0026; New England Railroad</corpname> system, 
and then the <corpname>New England Railroad</corpname> system in 1895.  In 1896 the <corpname>New England Railroad</corpname> suspended service on the line and it was abandoned. Service was sporatically resurrected once the <corpname>New York, New Haven &#x0026; Hartford Railroad</corpname> (better known as the New Haven Railroad) took over the entire 
New England Railroad system, and there was a brief attempt on reverting the line to trolley service in the 1910s, but by 1938 only two short remnants of the original MW&#x0026;CR remained at Waterbury and Meriden, and these were abandoned in 1976 when Conrail took over the line.  </p>

	<head>Scope and Content</head>
	<p>The album, compiled by Mr. <persname>James M.S. Ullman</persname> of <geogname>Meriden, Connecticut</geogname>, consists 
of 185 photographs almost exclusively depicting the locomotives, stations and other scenes of the <corpname>Meriden &#x0026; Cromwell Railroad</corpname> and the <corpname>Meriden, Waterbury, and Connecticut River Railroad</corpname>.  Most of the photographs have brief descriptions; most are dated.  Of special interest are photographs of wrecks on August 10, 1888, and July 19, 1889, at Red Bridge, in <geogname>Meriden, Connecticut</geogname>, and a trolley wreck on October 10, 1913, on the Berlin Branch.  Also of interest are photographs from the 1920s and 1930s of men on motorcycles who used the Meriden station as a base for their motorcycle club, and of Highland House (town unknown), a historic house that was located near the railroad line and burned down on November 24, 1914. </p>
