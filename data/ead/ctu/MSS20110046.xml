            <p>
                <persname>Albert Francis Blakeslee</persname> was born in 
                <geogname>Geneseo, New York</geogname>, in 1874 the son of 
                <persname>Francis Durbin Blakeslee</persname> and 
                <persname>Augusta Miranda Hubbard Blakeslee</persname>. He attended East Greenwich Academy (RI) before entering 
                <corpname>Wesleyan University</corpname>, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1896. Before his employment at 
                <corpname>Harvard University</corpname> as an teaching fellow of botany in 1900 and an instructor at 
                <corpname>Radcliffe College</corpname>, Blakeslee taught science at the Montpelier Seminary (VT) and East Greenwich Academy (RI). He received his Ph.D. in 1904 from Harvard University and from 1904-1906 studied Mucors in 
                <geogname>Germany</geogname> with a research grant from the 
                <corpname>Carnegie Institution of Washington</corpname>.</p>
            <p>Returning from

                <geogname>Storrs, Connecticut</geogname>, as professor of botany at 
                <corpname>Connecticut Agricultural College</corpname> in 1907. Before his departure in 1915, Blakeslee title changed to include genetics due to his successful work with the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station. In the fall of 1915, Blakeslee left

                <corpname>Carnegie Institute of Washington</corpname> in its Cold Spring Harbor (Long Island) facility. At Cold Spring Harbor, Blakeslee continued his studies as well as serving as Assistant Director from 1923-1936 and Director from 1936 until his retirement in 1941.</p>
