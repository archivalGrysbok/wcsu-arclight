            <p>The 
                <corpname>Cell Stress Society International</corpname> promotes collaboration among the various fields of stress research, international scientific cooperation, and public awareness. The society is made up of scholars investigating stress responses using molecular and cellular approaches, or bridging from the molecular and cellular level to organismal biology including studies of natural populations and to clinical and environmental applications. The idea to organize an international cell stress society has it roots deep in 
                <geogname>Asia</geogname> and in three events in particular.</p>
            <p>The first event was the launch by 
                <corpname>Churchill Livingstone</corpname> publishers of the journal 
                <title render="italic">Cell Stress &amp; Chaperones</title> in the fall of 1995 at the urging of attendees at an international meeting in 
                <geogname>Japan</geogname> earlier that year. By 1999, the 
                <corpname>CSSI</corpname> had taken ownership of its journal, assuring its successful survival. 
                <persname>Takashi Yura</persname> was appointed 
                <geogname>Asia</geogname>-
                <geogname>Australia</geogname> Regional Editor, and all of his successors have been Japanese scientists, including our current regional editor, 
                <persname>Kazuhiro Nagata</persname>. These appointments acknowledged the major contributions that Japanese scientists have made to the cellular stress response field and their scientific leadership, especially in greater 
                <geogname>Asia</geogname>.</p>
            <p>The second event was the first World Congress of Stress, organized by 
                <persname>Peter Csermely</persname> in Budapest in 1997. With an attendance twice the size of the largest previous meeting, the Budapest meeting demonstrated that there was great interest and enthusiasm from the global scientific community to support and attend international meetings in our field.</p>
            <p>The third event was a workshop entitled “Molecular Biology of Stress Responses”, held in Varanasi later in 1997, and organized by 
                <persname>Subhash Lakotia</persname> (
                <geogname>India</geogname>) at the encouragement of 
                <persname>Wolfgang Schumann</persname> (
                <geogname>Germany</geogname>). Workshop participants agreed on the value of continuing these workshops in developing countries with an emphasis on giving international students access to our field.</p>
            <p>By the second international workshop organized by 
                <persname>Tangchun Wu</persname> and 
                <persname>Robert M. Tanguay</persname> in Wuhan, P.R. 
                <geogname>China</geogname> in 1999, the CSSI was a reality and the Wuhan workshop became the first event officially sponsored by the Society. With the sponsorship of the 
                <corpname>CSSI</corpname>, the international workshops have continued with the third held in 
                <geogname>Mendoza, Argentina</geogname> (
                <persname>Daniel Ciocca</persname>, organizer), the fourth in 
                <geogname>Wuhan, P.R. China</geogname> (
                <persname>Tangchun Wu</persname>, organizer), the fifth in 
                <geogname>Concepción, Chile</geogname> (
                <persname>Antonio De Maio</persname>, organizer), the sixth in 
                <geogname>Bangkok, Thailand</geogname> (
                <persname>Wolfgang Schumann</persname> and , organizers) and the seventh in 
                <geogname>South Korea</geogname> (organized by 
                <persname>Eunil Lee</persname>). On a larger scale, the First CSSI International Congress (Quebec, 2003) was organized by 
                <persname>Robert M. Tanguay</persname>. The Second CSSI International Congress (
                <geogname>Tomar, Portugal</geogname>, 2005) was organized by 
                <persname>Claudina Rodriguez-Pousada</persname>, the third in Budapest (2007) by 
                <persname>Peter Csermely</persname> as part of the Second World Congress of Stress, and the Fourth CSSI International Congress in Sapporo (2009), was organized by 
                <persname>Noriyuki Sato</persname>. The upcoming Fifth CSSI Congress (2011), organized by 
                <persname>Robert M. Tanguay</persname>, will be held in Quebec City. The CSSI Medallion for career achievement has been awarded to 
                <persname>Takashi Yura</persname>, 
                <persname>Susan Lindquist</persname>,

                <persname>John Ellis</persname>, 
                <persname>Costa Georgopoulos</persname> and 
                <persname>Ferruccio Ritossa</persname>. The 
                <persname>Alfred Tissières</persname> Young Investigator Award has gone to 
                <persname>Anton Vila-Sanjorjo</persname>, 
                <persname>Ellen Nollen</persname> and 
                <persname>Wanping Xu</persname>. The Society continues to grow both in numbers and in international stature.</p>
