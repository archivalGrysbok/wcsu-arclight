         <head>History</head>
         <p>In 1991, President <persname>Harry J. Hartley</persname> appointed a  committee to advise him on appropriate and necessary considerations for  the celebration of the anniversary of the enrollment of women at the  institution that would become the <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>.  The committee of fifteen women, chaired by Professor <persname>Cynthia Adams</persname>, developed a year-long  program of activities to meet the stated goals of the committee: To seek women of the highest caliber to honor; promote diversity of women throughout higher education; celebrate the achievements of women, particularly those at the <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>; recognize the historical path of women; identify and address those paths not yet taken by women at the University; and to advance the institutional value and role of women at UConn. </p>
         <p>The activities included a convocation, lectures, presentations, awards and an exhibition on the Concourse between the Legislative Office Building and the State Capitol in Hartford during March 1992.</p>

      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520" id="a3">
         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The collection consists of the contents of a scrapbook created by the Committee to document the "100 Years" activities during the 1991-1992 academic year.  The scrapbook contained photographs, clippings, programs, announcements, memoranda, correspondence, flyers, brochures and posters.  The original scrapbook pages were photocopied in order prior to being disassembled and placed in folders.  In addition, other materials in the University Archives associated with the project have been included in the collection, including the lists of captions for the photographs included in the exhibition and photocopies of the images.  The original photographs have been reintegrated into the University Photograph Collection.  </p>
         <p>The original scrapbook, a flower print cloth bound, "magnetic" photograph album was returned to Professor Adams.</p>
