            <p>Poetic Journeys™ was developed by the Creative Writing Program at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> and inspired by the MTA New York City Transit's Poetry in Motion® series itself inspired by London's Poems on the Underground®. Poetic Journeys™ features poems written by UConn students, faculty and staff on placards designed by students in the University's Design Center.</p>
            <p>The first poetic journey began in the fall of 2000 and subsequent journeys have taken place every few weeks since on all of the campus buses. Poetic Journeys™ grants poets and designers a unique collaborative artistic experience. It offers the campus community and visitors a poetic respite from their busy days, and an opportunity, each time they board a bus, to embark on a different kind of journey. Other program sponsors include the UConn Co-op and the UConn Transportation Department.
