            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Carl W. Rettenmeyer was an American biologist who specialised in army ants. He was well known for his photography of army ants, with his photographs appearing in over 100 publications and he used his video footage to create two DVDs. He taught at the University of Kansas from 1960 until 1971 and then at the University of Connecticut until his retirement in 1996, after being diagnosed with Waldenstromâ€™s macroglobulinemia. After his death on April 9, 2009, a set of papers on army ants were published in 
                <emph render="italic">Insectes Sociaux </emph>in memory of his work. This collection houses correspondence and field notes from his professional life.</abstract>

            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>
                <persname>Carl W. Rettenmeyer</persname> was born in 
                <geogname>Meriden, Connecticut</geogname>, on February 10, 1931. He attended 
                <corpname>Swarthmore College</corpname> in 
                <geogname>Pennsylvania</geogname> after high school, majoring in biology and receiving a bachelors degree in 1953. During his junior year of college Rettenmeyer took a position as an assistant to a biology professor working in 
                <geogname>Panama</geogname>. It was during this six month assistanceship that Rettenmeyer became interested in studying army ants, which he would devote his professional career to studying. It was also during his college years that he met his future wife Marian, whom he would marry in 1955.</p>
            <p>From his interest in army ants, Rettenmeyer became fascinated with the animals that associated themselves with the ants, namely mites. After graduating from Swathmore, Rettenmeyer continued his studies at the 
                <corpname>University of Kansas</corpname>, receiving his Ph.D in entomology in 1962. He began teaching at the 
                <corpname>University of Kansas</corpname> in 1962, and during his time there he went on numerous expeditions to various rain forests. During his career Rettenmeyer discovered more than 500 other species of animals that lived among the ants, and was influential is bringing an awareness of the ant's importance to other scientists.</p>
            <p>In 1971 Rettenmeyer left the 
                <corpname>University of Kansas</corpname> to become a faculty member at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>. While at the university, Rettenmeyer taught courses in biology, social insects, and photography for biologists. He was also responsible for the redevelopment of the 
                <corpname>Connecticut State Museum of Natural History</corpname>, located at the university, in 1985. While at the university he also served as the head of the Section of Systematic and Evolutionary Biology from 1980 to 1983, and as the Executive Officer of the Biological Sciences Group from 1983 until 1985. In 1986 Rettenmeyer retired from teaching in order to focus entirely on rebuilding and promoting the Natural History Museum. He retired from the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> in 1996.</p>
            <p>
                <persname>Carl W. Rettenmeyer</persname> died April 9, 2009.</p>
