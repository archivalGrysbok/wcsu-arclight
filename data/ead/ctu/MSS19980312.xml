Some documents also contain French and/or German, often side by side with the Italian text. Many of the oldest documents also contain Latin, particularly those relating to Church matters. Some of the collection contains documents written in various Italian dialects, though in these instances, the language does not vary so much from standardized Italian as to be incomprehensible.</langmaterial>

                    <p>The period known as the Italian Risorgimento, or Resurgence, spanned from the early nineteenth century until the end of the Italian Unification period, which began in 1861 when a constitutional monarchy was established and ended when Rome was made capital of Italy in 1871. Unification of Italy into a republic was the ultimate goal of the Risorgimento activities, though many deemed the contitutional monarchy a successful end to their struggle. Figures such as Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Daniele Manin, Aurelio Saffi, Nicola Fabrizi and Massimo d’Azeglio were prominent within the movement, and they can be found as signatories on many of the documents found within the Broadside Collection. Additionally, the leaders of the various regional governments issued many of the notices and proclamations found here. Dukes Francesco IV and Francesco V of Modena, Duchess Maria Luigia and Duke Carlo II of Parma, Tuscan Grand Dukes Ferdinando III, Leopoldo II, and Ferdinando IV and Savoy Kings Carlo Alberto and Victor Emanuel II are all prominent in the collection. Lastly, the pope played a prominent role in peninsular political activities. Popes Pius VII, Leo XII, Pius VIII, and Gregory XVI all actively resisted the revolutionary uprisings of the first part of the nineteenth century while Pius IX was incredibly active in trying to maintain the integrity of the Papal States during the height of the revolutionary activities and moments of unification. The Risorgimento period was punctuated by years of intense revolutionary activity—1831, 1848, and 1849. It is in these years that there is an increased number of documents in the collection.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement and Description</head>
                    <p>All of the documents in this collection are ordered chronologically. In most cases, the regions and/or cities from which the documents originate are described, though the documents are not arranged by these various regions and/or cities. Regional inventories include those regions which can be found in each year, though this may include only one document (ie., If Papal States, Modena, and Lombardy are listed, there may only be one document from Lombardy).</p>
                    <p>There is a significantly larger number of documents from the years 1831, 1848, and 1849, so these documents are separated into the regions, cities and/or political organizations of their given historical moment. The most common designations include: Papal States, Duchy of Modena, Duchy of Parma, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Lombardy and Venice. There are also a significant number of documents from provisional governments in Rome, Bologna, Pesaro and Urbino, Senigallia, and Reggio. There is a more limited number of documents from the Kingdom of Piedmont and Sardinia and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, though these regions are represented. There are also some foreign documents, mostly from France and Austria. Within each regional designation, the documents are ordered chronologically. While documents from any one year are largely in the same location, very small or very large documents are housed elsewhere. The specific materials found in each box are listed in the scope and content section for that box. Within the box, selections of documents are grouped in the most logical order possible, either by a single year or a range of years. In instances where there are disparate years, all years are indicated on the division tabs as well as in this finding aid.</p>
                    <p>Some documents from 1796-1802 (Cisalpine Republic) are dated according the French Republican calendar. This calendar is structured in such as way that each Gregorian year spans two Republican years. Documents that fall into this category are organized by the Republican year/month system if no Gregorian year is given. The Gregorian year is noted on the organizing folder. If both a Republican date and a Gregorian date is given, the document is grouped with the Gregorian calendar documents. For example, documents from 1800 span Republican years VIII and IX.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of documents that do not contain any date information. These documents are separated in their designated boxes and are placed with the dated documents to which they seem closest. This placement is based on similarities in content, typeface, paper type, and any marginal notations that may exist.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                    <p>The earliest documents from this collection, from 1650 until the early nineteenth century generally relate to practices of everyday life. The large majority of these documents are legal notices stating rules and regulations for various practices. The most common topics include: sanitation ordinances (mostly related to the spread of both human and animal diseases such as cholera and bovine epizootic influenza), notices regarding acceptable currency and specie exchange rates, governmental organizational changes (newly appointed officials), rules and regulations regarding guild affiliation (who could join, who could not, organization of guilds, when guild affiliation must be declared), criminal activity reports and sentences, and rules and regulations regarding the celebration of Carnival (who could wear masks and when they could be worn, rules for the setting off of fireworks, rules regarding general merriment). There are also many Church documents from these years.</p>
                    <p>The documents from 1796 to 1800 relate to the Napoleonic invasion of Italy and the establishment of the Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy. The regions, or departments, of the Cisalpine Republic included the areas around the following cities: Milan, Cremona, Bergamo, Morbegno, Brescia, Mantua, Modena, Reggio, Bologna, Ferrara, and Forlì. The Cisalpine Republic adopted the French Republican calendar, so many of the documents are dated according to this system. These are indicated within their respective boxes. The content of these documents is similar to that discussed above.</p>
                    <p>Of any given year in the collection, the most documents come from the major revolutionary years of 1831, 1848, and 1849. The documents from 1831 contain many notices and proclamations from the provisional government that were formed during the various uprisings, particularly in Bologna, Pesaro and Urbino, Senigallia, and Modena. There are also documents from the short lived United Provinces. 1848 was a major year for revolutions not only in Italy, but throughout Europe. Provisional governments were established in Venice, Milan, Piedmont, and eventually in Rome. The collection contains many news reports, proclamations, and declarations from this year. In 1849, the short lived Roman Republic was established, led by the Triumvirate of Giuseppe Mazzini, Aurelio Saffi, and Carlo Armellini. The Roman Republic spread to and was supported by the governments in other cities, including Bologna, Pesaro, and Urbino. The collection contains documents from all of these cities and speaks to the important and progressive changes instituted by the Republican leaders. After the fall of the Roman Republic in July 1849 there is a drastic decrease in the number of broadsides for that year. Throughout these years there are also a significant number of documents issued by the Pope in the Papal States and well as those issued by the hereditary leaders in various regions (Dukes, Grand Dukes, etc.). Many of these serve as counter measures/arguments to those documents issues by the revolutionary/provisional governments. While many of the documents are official in nature, the collection also contains examples of propaganda-type materials. Short pieces discussing the activities of Mazzini, Garibaldi, and others can be found, as well as short writings by these individuals. “Republican Catechisms” are present, which appear to have been used as a method though which to convey and expand the impact of revolutionary goals. There are also news dispatches from various locations, discussing the movements of revolutionary and non-revolutionary forces.</p>
                    <p>The documents from the 1850s return to the style, themes, and structures of those from before the revolutionary period. There also seems to be an effort to quell revolutionary activities and stabilize, if not increase, the power of the Church. There are relatively few documents from the unification period, and most maintain the quotidian themes previously discussed. There are a few documents, however, that speak to the success of the revolutionary goals and the achievements made through past struggles.</p>

                        <p>The Cisalpine Republic was the French client republic in Northern Italy that existed from 1797 to 1802. The republic followed the French Republican calendar. The years of this calendar began in September of the Gregorian calendar, thus one Republican year spanned parts of two Gregorian years. This calendar also uses a different month system. For example, Republican Year VI ran from 1797-1798. The months Vendemiare, Brumiare, Frimiare, and Nivôse (days 1-10) are from the first year, and the months Nivôse (day 11 onward), Pluviôse, Ventôse, Germinal, Floreal, Prairial, Messidor, Thermidor, Fructidor are from the second year.</p>

                        <p>The Cisalpine Republic was the French client republic in Northern Italy that existed from 1797 to 1802. The republic followed the French Republican calendar. The years of this calendar began in September of the Gregorian calendar, thus one Republican year spanned parts of two Gregorian years. This calendar also uses a different month system. For example, Republican Year VI ran from 1797-1798. The months Vendemiare, Brumiare, Frimiare, and Nivôse (days 1-10) are from the first year, and the months Nivôse (day 11 onward), Pluviôse, Ventôse, Germinal, Floreal, Prairial, Messidor, Thermidor, Fructidor are from the second year.</p>
