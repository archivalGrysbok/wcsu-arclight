            <p>Founded in 1993, the Asian American Studies Institute at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> is a leading East Coast multidisciplinary research and teaching program that reflects the heterogeneity of both Asian American Studies and Asian America. Although the primary focus of the Institute is upon experiences of people of Asian ancestry in America, attention is also given to the study of Asia, since Asian informs the Asian American Experience. This transnational orientation is reflected through the Institute’s research initiatives, teaching, and community outreach. The institute encourages students to explore the ways in which race, gender, and class are shaped though immigration histories, social inequalities, changing global dynamics and shifting border politics.</p>

The Institute has proudly hosted a number of national initiatives (including "East of California," "History and Politics of Filipino Americans," and a conference focused on Nepali Women). The Institute’s commitment to community engagement is apparent in its programming, such as the annual Nazrul Conference and "Day of Remembrance" Lecture.</p>
            <p>The Institute offers a minor in Asian American Studies and cross-list courses with several departments. Detailed information about the Institute and its activities and programs is available on the Institute

                    <p>Day of Rememberance at the University of Connecticut is a free, annual, public educational lecture/event that examines the history and significance of imprisoning people of Japanese ancestry in the Americas, the United States, Canada, and countires in Central and South America, during World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. At UConn, the Asian American Studies Institute initiated this event, observed annually in February to demonstrate its continued commitment to study this negalected aspect of US constitutional history. Originally funded by the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund to create a Japanese American Internment resource library and conceived to support the investigation of the issue by students, staff and faculty at UConn. The Institute facilitates this study by inviting formerly interned persons to share their recollections of life in the camps with the university community as a "Day of Rememberance." This program has developed into the region's most visible forum for educating the general public about this still largely neglected era of US history and associated implications for international politics and human rights.</p>
