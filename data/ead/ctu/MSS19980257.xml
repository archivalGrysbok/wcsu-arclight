            <head>History</head>
            <p>In 1896, the students of the 
                <corpname>Storrs Agricultural College</corpname> established a student newspaper, 
                <title render="italic">The Lookout</title>. Published every month, the paper had a small, unpaid staff who laid out the pages by hand using tiny metal slugs with embossed letters from a printer's California job case. By 1914, the paper had changed its name to 
                <title render="italic">The Connecticut Campus</title>, reflecting the growth of the institution that had become the 
                <corpname>Connecticut Agricultural School</corpname> in 1899 and the student newspaper increased its publication schedule to twice a month. The paper continued to grow along with the campus in 
                <geogname>Storrs, CT</geogname>, and in 1953 the 
                <title render="italic">The Connecticut Campus</title>, which had moved from being published monthly, to weekly and then to a three days a week publication schedule made its last transition to becoming a daily newspaper. In 1955, the renamed 
                <title render="italic">Connecticut Daily Campus</title> becomes a morning paper that is printed on newsprint. In the 1970s, the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> Board of Trustees granted the 
                <title render="italic">Connecticut Daily Campus</title> its independence from the Associated Student Government.</p>
            <p>Currently, the 
                <title render="italic">Daily Campus</title> is the largest daily college newspaper in the state of 
                <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> and employs more than 120 students during the academic year. Published Monday through Friday during the academic year, 10,000 copies are delivered to over 80 locations both on- and off-campus.</p>
