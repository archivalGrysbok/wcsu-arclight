            <head>History</head>
            <p>In April 1881, the 
                <corpname>Connecticut General Assembly</corpname> established the 
                <corpname>Storrs Agricultural School</corpname> after accepting a gift of 170 acres of land, several frame buildings, and money from Charles and 
                <persname>Augustus Storrs</persname>. The School opened on 28 September 1881, with twelve students in the first class. Before the turn of the century there were two name changes (
                <corpname>Storrs Agricultural College</corpname> 1893, 
                <corpname>Connecticut Agricultural College</corpname> 1899). In 1933, two years after the institution celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, it became 
                <corpname>Connecticut State College</corpname>, a name more in keeping with its steady advances and broadened mission. Six years later, in 1939, the General Assembly designated the institution the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>, an acknowledgment of the institution's developing importance to the State in graduate and professional education, research and public service.</p>
            <p>The 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> is recognized as the state's flagship institution of higher learning. Since its establishment, the University has grown to include 13 Schools and Colleges at its main campus in Storrs, separate Schools of Law and Social Work in Hartford, five regional campuses throughout the state and Schools of Medicine and Dentistry at the UConn Health Center in Farmington.</p>
            <p>UConn is a Land Grant and Sea Grant College and a Space Grant Consortium institution. The University spans 4,104 acres at its main campus and five regional campuses, and an additional 162 acres at the UConn Health Center in Farmington.</p>
            <p>Designated a Carnegie Foundation Research University-Extensive, UConn has more than 70 focused research centers where faculty, graduate students and undergraduates explore everything from improving human health to enhancing public education and protecting the countryâ€™s natural resources.</p>
            <p>At this time there is no specific information about the Institute of Cooperative Marketing.</p>
