            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Joanna Cole was born in Newark, New Jersey on August 11, 1944. After graduating from the City College of New York, Ms. Cole worked at Newsweek answering letters to the editor. For a brief period she worked as a librarian at an elementary school in Brooklyn before returning to Newsweek and continuing her career in publishing. She also worked as an associate editor for the SeeSaw Book Club at Scholastic, and as a senior editor for Doubleday Books for Young Readers. In 1980, she became a freelance writer, writing children's books and articles for magazines.</p>
            <p>While she has written some 250 fiction and nonfiction books for children, she is most famous for her Magic School Bus Series. The first book in that series was written in 1985 and published the following year. The main character, Ms. Frizzle, was inspired by Cole's own fifth grade teacher who would conduct science experiments in front of the class on a regular basis, inspiring Ms. Cole's love of the subject.</p>
            <p>She has sold millions of copies of her books, which have also been translated into multiple languages.</p>
            <p>For more information on Joanna Cole, please see her page at Scholastic.</p>
