            <head>History</head>
            <p>Three acts signed by President Lincoln in 1862 shaped the 
                <geogname>U.S.</geogname> Agricultural history: the act authorizing a 
                <corpname>U.S. Department of Agriculture</corpname>; the Homestead Act, encouraging settlement of public domain lands; and the Morrill Act establishing land grant colleges in every state and placing instruction in agriculture and home economics in higher education.</p>
            <p>The history and formation of the cooperative extension dates back to The Hatch Act of 1887 which established a cooperative bond between USDA and the nation's land-grant colleges allocating annual federal funding for research. This was one of the ways to improve the productivity of the farms and by doing this, build up the economy and also help the communities. It was the driving force for the land-grant colleges to meet the agriculture's needs. The Smith-Lever Act in 1914 provided funds for cooperative administration of agricultural extension education by USDA and the state land grant colleges.</p>
            <p>In 1893, the 
                <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> General Assembly approved an act “establishing the 
                <corpname>Storrs Agricultural College</corpname> [
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname>] and providing for the distribution of money received from the 
                <geogname>United States</geogname> for Educational purposes.” With the passage of this act, the institution which would become the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> was designated the state's land-grant college and the recipient of federal funds for agricultural education.</p>
            <p>In 
                <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> the Cooperative Extension System strives to help 
                <geogname>Connecticut's</geogname> diverse population manage their family resources and develop strong family units through increased employability, bettering their decision making abilities, and by promoting enhanced self esteem. Through programs focused on the topics of parenting, 4-H and youth development, nutrition and food safety, child care, money management, lead poisoning and health the CES serves to guide children, youth and adults in coping with the challenges of everyday living.</p>
