<head>Biography</head>
<p><persname>Thomas Park Dumaine</persname>, the seventh and last child of <persname>Frederic C. Dumaine, Sr.</persname> and <persname>Bessie Dumaine</persname>, was born on 21 August 1912, in <geogname>Groton, Massachusetts</geogname>. <persname>F.C. Dumaine, Sr.</persname> (1866-1951) owned <corpname>Amoskeag Manufacturing Company</corpname> and was at one time the president of the <corpname>New Haven Railroad</corpname>. For reasons unknown, <persname>Thomas Park</persname>'s name was legally changed to <persname>Pierre Thomas</persname> by his father at some point in his early childhood. Pierre's nickname was &#x201C;Spike&#x201D;. His education and the activities of his early youth are unknown; it is thought that he either picked up a mechanical background working at one or more of his father's holdings over the years and that his early jobs were in his father's mills.</p>
<p>Dumaine was involved in a joint venture between the <corpname>New Haven Railroad</corpname> and the <corpname>Mack Corporation</corpname> during the early 1950s that resulted in the development of the Mack &#x201C;FCD&#x201D; Rail-Bus. He served as President of the <corpname>New England Transportation Company</corpname>, a bus and trucking company based in Boston, in the early to mid-1950s.</p>
<p>Dumaine served on the <corpname>Boston and Maine Railroad</corpname>'s board of  directors during the early to mid-1950s. He possibly resigned after <persname>Patrick McGinnis</persname> became the railroad's president in January 1956.</p>
<p><persname>Pierre Thomas Dumaine</persname> was married to Margaret (last name unknown) until they divorced in 1959. They had two children, Lael and Peter. He married <persname>Evelyn Laffery</persname> in 1961. He died on 13 August 1987, in <geogname>Portland, Maine</geogname>.</p>

<head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection consists of three volumes, a scrapbook and two photograph albums, compiled by <persname>Pierre Thomas Dumaine</persname>.</p>
<p>The scrapbook is composed almost entirely of newspaper clippings, many compiled by the <corpname>New England Newsclip Agency, Inc.</corpname> of Boston. Featured in the scrapbook are articles about <persname>Pierre Dumaine</persname>'s work as President of the <corpname>New England Transportation Company</corpname> and a strike of mechanics for the bus company in August 1953. Also included is information about a proxy fight for control of the <corpname>New Haven Railroad</corpname> in the Spring of 1954, when <persname>F. C. Dumaine, Jr.</persname>, <persname>Pierre Dumaine</persname>'s brother, lost control of the railroad to <persname>Patrick McGinnis</persname>. There are also articles about McGinnis's move to merge the <corpname>New Haven Railroad</corpname> with the <corpname>Boston and Maine Railroad</corpname> in 1955.</p>
<p>The first photograph album is entitled &#x201C;The Conference Car at Brockton Fair, Sept. '53.&#x201D; It is composed of sixteen photographs, all measuring 8&#x2033;&#x00D7;10&#x2033;. Many of the photographs show men posed in front of a <corpname>New England Transportation Company</corpname> bus.</p>
<p>The second photograph album is entitled &#x201C;The New Haven Railroad Commuter Cars 1954.&#x201D; The album holds twenty photographs, all measuring 8&#x2033;&#x00D7;10&#x2033;, showing interiors and exteriors of railroad coaches, group photographs (some including <persname>Pierre Dumaine</persname>), and other unidentified  men, presumably railroad executives.</p>
