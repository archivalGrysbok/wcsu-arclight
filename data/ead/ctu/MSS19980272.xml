            <p>The 
                <corpname>National Association of Real Estate Exchanges</corpname> was established on 
                <date>May 12, 1908</date>, at the YMCA Auditorium in 
                <geogname>Chicago, IL</geogname>. With 120 founding members, 19 Boards, and one State Association, the 
                <corpname>National Association of Real Estate Exchanges</corpname>' objective was "to unite the real estate men of America for the purpose of effectively exerting a combined influence upon matters affecting real estate interests." In 1916, the 
                <corpname>National Association of Real Estate Exchange</corpname>'s name was changed to The 
                <corpname>National Association of Real Estate Boards</corpname> (
                <corpname>NAREB</corpname>). In 1972, the name of the 
                <corpname>National Association of Real Estate Boards</corpname> was changed to the 
                <corpname>National Association of Realtors</corpname>速 (
                <corpname>NAR</corpname>). The Association became the largest trade association in the 
                <geogname>United States</geogname> in the early 1970s, with over 400,000 members. Today, the 
                <corpname>National Association of Realtors</corpname>速 has over 1.2 million members, 54 State Associations (including 
                <geogname>Guam</geogname>, 
                <geogname>Puerto Rico</geogname>, and the 
                <geogname>Virgin Islands</geogname>) and more than 1,400 local Associations. This and additional details about the organization can be found on their

            <p>In 1952, the Build America Better Committee began as a program with the focus on re-energizing run-down neighborhoods. The program's name was changed to Realtor速 Week in 1956, to distinguish Realtors速 from non-members, and to highlight the right to own property as one of the cornerstones of democracy. In 1975, the name was changed to Private Property Week, in order to promote the basic human and constitutional right to own, use and transfer property. In 1986, the name was changed to American Home Week, celebrating the constitutional right to own private property, and home ownership. From 2002 to 2008, National Homeownership Month was created to celebrate homeownership across the country. This information and more is available on the NAR
