         <head>Biography</head>
         <p>
            <persname>Fred Otto Makowsky</persname> was born in <geogname>New York City</geogname> on <date>26 July 1888</date>. His father, <persname>Otto Maxmillian Makowsky</persname>, immigrated from <geogname>Germany</geogname>.  When Fred was at an early age, his family moved to <geogname>Stamford, Connecticut</geogname>, where his  father opened a successful barbershop on Relay Place.</p>
         <p>Young Fred demonstrated a keen interest and an exceptional skill in  crafting things at an early age.  At age 13 he built his first model  train, a sleeper passenger coach.  It was built of cardboard, well- lacquered and painted and had wheels of thread spools.  When 14 he build a working paddle wheel boat by modifying a small rowboat.
Although he had several varying interests at that time, such as collecting butterflies, Indian arrowheads, and stamps and coins, his real love was railroads.  He wanted to work in railroading, but his f ather discouraged such a "new-fangled" pursuit and directed him to engage in work of "more substance", such as bookkeeping.  And so he obtained a job as bookkeeper, accountant working for the coal firm of <corpname>Graves &#x0026; Strang</corpname>.  He also had a job more to  his liking -- engraving tombstones for <corpname>Bounty's Monuments</corpname> -- and did so well that he won a design contest for a Stamford City Monument.</p>
         <p>Throughout his life, <persname>Fred Makowsky</persname> continued to be lured by railroads. On weekends he traveled throughout the country to view various cars or railroad stations, which he photographed.  Over  the years, he acquired an extensive collection of railroad timetables, train tickets, posters, photographs and other railroad memorabilia.  He spent countless hours crafting metal railroad cars, paying attention to minute details in an effort to recreate them as perfectly as possible.  All of these cars ran in his attic under electric power.  He also crafted the tracks, along with realistic scenery, tunnels, turntables and other models.</p>
         <p>Fred made it a point to attend the Chicago World's Fair to view the Railroad Exhibition, as well as the 1939 New York World's Fair.  In 1937 he was offered a job designing and making scenery for backgrounds for exhibits for the New York Fair.  However, he turned down the job offer, saying that if his hobby became his work it would cease to be fun.</p>
         <p>Fred led a very modest life as a bachelor, living in <geogname>Springdale, Connecticut</geogname>, with his sister, who also  never married.  However, his spare time was filled with the vicarious excitement of a new and fascinating means of travel.  Although he never could pursue the career he so longed for, one can't help but think that  at least he could imagine what life would have been like as a railroad  engineer as he crafted his trains, or browsed through his collections.  He died on <date>23 December 1952</date>, leaving a wealth of railroad  memorabilia that would live long after him for others to enjoy as he  did.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The <persname>Fred Otto Makowsky</persname> Papers consist of  photographs taken by Makowsky and papers collected by him.</p>
         <p>The photographs consist of over 4000 images of <corpname>New Haven Railroad</corpname> and other American steam and electric locomotives,  multiple unit cars, and trolleys, and scenes of <geogname>Stamford, Connecticut</geogname>.  Most of the images were removed from the  original albums, given unique identifying numbers, and sleeved in mylar  enclosures.  The photographs of <geogname>Stamford, Connecticut</geogname>, remain in their original album compiled by  Makowsky.</p>
         <p>The papers consist of train tickets, newspaper clippings, correspondence to Makowsky, and other railroad-related printed materials.</p>
         <p>In addition, two models of <corpname>New York &#x0026; New Haven Railroad</corpname> coaches, built by Makowsky in 1936, are on permanent display in the Reference Room, Thomas J. Dodd Research Center.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Series I: Photographs</emph> (undated, 1890s-1952)  consists of 14 binders of over 4000 photographs of New Haven Railroad  and other railroads' locomotives, trains, trolleys, and stations.   Makowsky labeled each photograph with such information as location and  date taken, with pertinent information about the image (for example, he described steam locomotives in terms of engine number and wheel alignment).  Each photograph is fully described in an Archives &#x0026; Special Collections in-house database.  Please speak to the Curator or the reference desk staff about access to this database.</p>
         <p>Also included is an album compiled by Makowsky of photographs of <geogname>Stamford, Connecticut</geogname>.  Box 5 contains ten compact disks of 460 scanned images selected from those in the first five binders (in box 1), scanned at 600 dpi TIFF format.  These images were used for the digital collection "Steam and Electric Locomotive of the New Haven Railroad." </p>

            <emph render="bold">Series II: Papers</emph> (undated, 1897-1948) includes an album compiled by Makowsky of train tickets, newspaper clippings, timetables, and correspondence to Makowsky, all railroad related.</p>
