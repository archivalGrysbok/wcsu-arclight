    <head>History</head>
<p>District Lodge 91, which oversees Lodge activity in Eastern Connecticut.</p><p>Local 743 has had several problems with management in its time. The first occurred in 1946 when the union went out on strike over seniority and grievance rights. The strike was unsuccessful, however, and only lasted for a few days. President of the local at that time was Thomas Lynch. In 1960, the union went out on strike for nine weeks over work grievance procedures, union power, job security, and seniority. The president of the local during this strike was Butler Siedman.</p><p>During its history, the union has appealed numerous times to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when it believed United Aircraft/United Technologies Company was bargaining in bad faith. In the early 1970s, the union appealed to the NLRB, but before the hearing was scheduled, United Aircraft transferred the Broadbrook facility to Composite Materials Corporation, a subsidiary of American Aluminum Company (ALCOA). In 1976, Composite Materials Corporation declined to renew its lease with United Aircraft Company. At this time, United Aircraft closed its Broadbrook facility and moved its production to the Windsor Locks Electronic buildings.</p>  </bioghist>

Four days after the workers' decision to organize, United Aircraft retracted a previously scheduled salary increase. Efforts by Local 743 to negotiate a new contract were delayed by United Aircraft until 1972. After six months of negotiations, Local 743 filed charges with the NLRB that United Aircraft was not bargaining in good faith. Before a hearing could be scheduled, ownership of the Broadbrook facility was transferred from United Aircraft to Composite Materials Corporation (CMC), a subsidiary of American Aluminum Company (ALCOA). As a leasor of the Broadbrook facility, CMC refused to recognize the union and on 11 March 1974 filed a petition with NLRB challenging the union's majority status. Following and investigation by the NLRB on 11 September 1974, CMC voluntarily withdrew its petition and recognized Local 743 as the sole bargaining agent of employees at the Broadbrook facility. An agreement was subsequently negotiated by Local 743 and CMC on 9 September 1974. In 1976, CMC declined to renew its lease and returned the Broadbrook facility to United Aircraft Company.
