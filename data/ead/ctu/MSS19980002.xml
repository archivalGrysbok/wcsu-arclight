            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>
                <persname>Judith Liberman</persname> was born in 
                <geogname>Israel</geogname> and came to the 
                <geogname>United States</geogname> after high school. She earned degrees in social studies and law from four American universities, including a J.D. from the 
                <corpname>University of Chicago Law School</corpname>. After writing and lecturing on the law, Liberman realized her real passion lay in the arts. She has since dedicated her life to writing fiction and pursuing the arts, and has spent the last twenty years painting and creating graphic art. The greatest example of her commitment to the arts is a children's book she wrote in 1975-1976 entitled The Bird's Last Song. The book resulted from a class assignment that asked students to write a fairy tale based on autobiographical materials. Liberman's 
                <title render="italic">The Bird's Last Song</title> is inspired in part by the passing of her father in 1968, and the ways in which his contributions to the world outlived him.</p>
            <p>Liberman's artistic endeavors are not limited solely to children's books. She also created Holocaust Wall Hangings for an exhibit to coincide with the opening of the Dodd Center at the 
                <corpname>University of Connecticut</corpname> in 1995. She has exhibited on numerous one-woman and group shows, and her paintings and coodcuts can be found in collections throughout the world.</p>
