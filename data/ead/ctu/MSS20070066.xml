	<head>History</head>
	<p><persname>Louise B. Gaffney Flannigan</persname> was born on <date>June 14, 1867</date>, in <geogname>New Haven, 
Connecticut</geogname>, in a house on Portsea Street (possibly 272 Portsea Street).  As the sister and then wife of railroad 
men, Louise was the "poetess" of the <corpname>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen</corpname> Lodge #201, in <geogname>New Haven,
Connecticut</geogname> (also referred to as the Elm City Lodge), whose members
were employed by the <corpname>New York, New Haven &#x0026; Hartford Railroad</corpname>.  Louise wrote poems 
and memorials to those who died in the line of duty, or in celebration of their heroism and fortitude.  Some of her writings 
were published in such magazines as <title render="italic">The American Federationist</title> and <title render="italic">The 
Railroad Brakemen’s Journal</title>, and in the local newspaper, the <title render="italic">New Haven Register</title>.</p>

<p>A Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen Lodge, #388 (possibly number 336), in <geogname>Needles, California</geogname>, was 
named in honor of <persname>Louise Gaffney Flannigan</persname>.</p>

<p>Louise married <persname>Francis J. Flannigan</persname> (Frank), a railroad brakeman, in 1889.  
Louise and Frank had seven children – Frederick, Isabel, Elvira, Frank, Viola, Rhetta Louise, and Virginia.  </p>

<p><persname>Frank Flannigan</persname> was born on <date>March 21, 1864</date>, in <geogname>Ireland</geogname>.  
Family legend describes his early life in this way: Frank came to the <geogname>United States</geogname> through <geogname>Canada</geogname> and was put into an orphanage in 
<geogname>New York City</geogname>.  He ran away from the orphanage and "went out west" to join the army. On a train going 
west he met a man named <persname>Dave Medill</persname> who befriended him. Medill told him that when he got out of the 
army to come to <geogname>New Haven, Connecticut</geogname>, and he would help him get a job 
on the railroad, the <corpname>New York, New Haven &#x0026; Hartford Railroad</corpname> .  Frank did just that -- when he got to 
New Haven, Medill helped him find a room and board and sent him to the Portsea Street address where he met Louise.</p>  

<p>Frank died in a railroad accident on February 11, 1915.  His death is described, again through family legend, in this way:
The railroad switched its warning system for incoming trains from bells to electric flashing lights. Frank did not
 know the switch had taken place that day and was crushed to death by a train. 
This took place at Union Station in <geogname>New Haven, Connecticut</geogname>.  Louise would not sue the railroad after 
Frank's death and the railroad apparently promised to hire her children for jobs with  the railroad if they so wished. </p>

<p>Family legend also has it that Louise's brother Fred, known as "Gaff" (and referred to frequently in her poems and writings), 
went off to fight in the Spanish American War (1898-1899) but came down ill with diptheria and "Louise brought him home to 
die."</p>

<p>Little is known about Louise's life after Frank's death except that she lived in her sister Isabella's house on Portsea 
Street and herself worked for the railroad "in the office" until she retired in 1936.  Louise died on <date>May 2, 1949</date>.
    Both Frank and Louise are buried at <corpname>St. Bernard Cemetery</corpname> in <geogname>West Haven, Connecticut</geogname>.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The <persname>Louise Gaffney Flannigan</persname> Papers consist of 52 poems and writings written by 
Louise, mostly in the late 1880s, in her unofficial position as "poetess" of the <corpname>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen</corpname> Lodge #201 of <geogname>New Haven, Connecticut</geogname>.  Most of the poems were written in memorial to railroad brakemen who died in the line of duty or in celebration of their work.  Interesting items in the collection
include an undated jingle Louise wrote in praise of Solution Soap; a report of a visit Louise and her husband Frank made to 
a <geogname>Chicago, Illinois</geogname>, home for "crippled" brakemen, with a request for donations from the members of 
the New Haven lodge; a 1895 poem written on the "terrible sea disaster of the Steamer Elbe" which sank in the <geogname>North Sea</geogname> off of the coast of <geogname>England</geogname>; and a ten-page description of a train trip Louise and her husband Frank took in 1897 from <geogname>New Haven, Connecticut</geogname>, to <geogname>California</geogname>, where she describes the journey in great detail, including her impressions of Indians.  </p>

            <emph render="bold">Series I: Poems and writings</emph> (<date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">undated, 
1887-1897, 1932</date>) consists of 52 poems and writings by <persname>Louise Gaffney Flannigan</persname>.  Most of the writings were written in memorial to railroad men who died on the job, others were written in celebration of their good work and fortitude.  Most of the items are manuscript, presumably by Louise, with the exception of the girl's quiz, also manuscript but not in the same handwriting as the other documents (although it is possible that it was written by Louise when she was a very young girl).  </p>

            <emph render="bold"> Series II: Photocopies of photographs  </emph> (<date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1889, 1911, 1915</date>) consists of photocopies of three photographs: of Louise and Frank on their wedding day in 1889; of a large group of people in a park, labeled "Family Day of Elm City Div 317, 9-24-'11, from 1911; and of a large group of men and women (including Louise and Frank), all sitting on the steps of what is possibly the <geogname>New Haven, Connecticut</geogname>, post office, in 1915.</p>
