    <head>History </head>
<p>The Commerical Telegraphers' Union of America was a labor organization that represented workers in the telegraph business during the twentieth century. Established through the organization and consolidation of numerous regional telegraph unions across the country in 1902, the Commerical Telegraphers' Union joined the American Federation of Labor organization in July 1903. During the 1910s, 1920's, and 1930s the union helped fight for women's rights in business, as many workers employed in the telegraph business were women. The union saw its peak membership reach nearly 20,000 during the 1940s, only to decline rapidly shortly afterwards as telegraph service declined in America. Amid a period of even sharper decline for the telegraph business the union changed its name in 1968 to the United Telegraph Workers. In 1986, with telegraph service almost non-existent in America, the union merged with the Communications Workers of America. Local 47 of the Commercial Telegraphers' Union was formed in 1942 by fifteen members of Western Union in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>  </bioghist>
