<abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract:">The Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourismâ€™s State Historic 
Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Office of Connecticut State Archaeology are the lead agencies for the preservation of the state's archaeological and architectural historic heritage. This guide provides references to documentary, architectural 
and archaeological survey reports conducted in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations regarding cultural 
resource protection, provided by SHPO, and is intended to provide researchers with an overview of the 
available literature and completed surveys. The surveys are organized by the 169 Connecticut towns, as well as sections for 
Statewide, Regional or Thematic surveys, and  thereunder within four catagories of types of surveys 
-- Historical and Architectural, Archaeological, Documentation Studies, and Maps.  Other materials include books, CDs, 
posters, and pamphlets.</abstract>

<bioghist altrender="biography" encodinganalog="545" id="a2">
	<head>Organizational History</head>
	<p>The <corpname>Connecticut Historical Commission</corpname> was established in 1955 as a state agency, and was mandated when the National Historic Preservation Act required every state to appoint a State Historic Preservation Officer and establish a State Historic Preservation Office.  In 2003 <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> established the Division on Culture and Tourism which combined the state's historical commission, the Commission on the Arts, the Film Office and the Tourism Office.  The division administers the State Register of Historic Places as well as federally funded National Register-based programs designed to identify, register, and protect the buildings, sites, structures, districts, and objects that comprise and define <geogname>Connecticut</geogname>'s cultural heritage. The CHC also possesses regulatory authority for all archaeological studies undertaken on state lands or within state-administered waters. </p>
</bioghist>

<scopecontent encodinganalog="520" id="a3">
	<head>Scope and Content</head>
	<p>The collection consists of archaeological surveys, historical and architectural surveys, documentation studies of 
properties, and maps, produced for the <corpname>Connecticut Historical Commission</corpname> by archaeologists and 
historians.  Other materials include books, CDs, posters, and pamphlets.  </p>

<p>Architectural Surveys:</p>

<p>Most of the historical and architectural surveys were completed by selected towns in the state to inventory properties they 
deemed historical and noteworthy. These surveys often determined which properties would be eligible for submission to the 
National Register of Historic Places.  Please note that the forms for the NRHP submissions are not kept with the CHPC; they 
are kept at Connecticut's Division of Culture and Tourism, in Hartford.   </p>



<p>Archaeological Surveys:</p>

<p>The <corpname>Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office</corpname> (SHPO) describes the archaeological survey process in this manner: </p>

<p>The National Historic Preservation Act mandates that all federally funded, assisted, licensed and/or permitted projects be 
reviewed by the <corpname>Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office</corpname>. As such, they review 1,200 to 1,500 
proposed projects annually and, depending upon specific project location, will require the federal agency (or permit 
applicant) to employ a professional archaeological consultant to conduct appropriate historic and archaeological studies. 
Approximately seventy percent of the archaeological reports are generated from the federal review process.</p>

<p>The <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> Environmental Policy Act (CEPA) mandates that state agencies coordinate with SHPO regarding the consideration of historic and archaeological resources as part of project planning and development. Unlike the federal process, state agency assisted, permitted or licensed projects are exempt from the historical 
commission's  review.  It is only when the state agency proposes an action (such as, for example, a new campus building, changes in a state park, construction of a new prison) that SHPO has an opportunity to review and comment.  Also, any proposed archaeological investigation on state lands (whether CEPA-related or academic research) requires a permit from the office. About ten percent of the CHPC archaeological reports are generated in this manner.</p>

<p>About thirty town governments have enacted Planning and Zoning regulations that require developers to consult with 
the State Archaeologist regarding archaeological sensitivity of proposed subdivisions. In turn, the State Archaeologist 
may require the developer to hire an archaeological consultant.  Also, towns have chosen to require archaeological surveys, 
irrespective of its regulations, for especially complex or controversial projects as an important way to gather additional 
information about a proposed development area. This generates about ten percent of CHPC reports.</p>

<p>The last ten percent represents projects that tribal governments, town governments, and/or private property owners have 
commissioned to acquire baseline data about their respective properties.  Other surveys may be generated as academic research 
projects (thesis-related).</p>

<p>[Thanks to <persname>David Poirier</persname>, former Staff Archeologist of the <corpname>Connecticut Historical 
Commission</corpname>, for the above description of the survey process.]</p>

<p>Documentation Studies:</p>
<p>Documentation studies are generated when a federal or <geogname>Connecticut</geogname>-funded project has to take into account its affects on historical archeaological resources.  The studies document the "before" structure or when changes in the structure mitigate adverse effects of changing or destroying the building.  If the building is considered irreplaceable or very important historically then the <corpname>State Historic Preservation Office</corpname> decides whether or not to allow the project to proceed.</p>

</scopecontent>

<arrangement encodinganalog="351$b" id="a5">
	<head>Arrangement</head>
	<p>The surveys and studies are arranged alphabetically by <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> town and thereunder by historic and architectural survey, archaeological survey, documentation study, and maps.  Cities in the state of <geogname>Connecticut</geogname> are considered dependent municipalities, meaning they are located within and subordinate to a town. All but one -- <geogname>Groton, Connecticut</geogname> -- of the currently existing cities in Connecticut are consolidated with their parent town.  Winsted is an incorporated city but administered within the town of Winchester.  Former cities include South Norwalk, which is consolidated in the town of Norwalk; Rockville, which is a census-designated place and a village in the town of Vernon; and Willimantic, a census-designated place in the town of Windham. Information about villages within towns (ex. Storrs is a village of the town of Mansfield) can be found within the literature about the town.</p>

<p>Historical and Architectural Surveys and Documentation Studies should be requested by town and title of survey or study, 
or title only.  Archaeological surveys are each given an item number (ex. CHPC no. 756).  Maps are organized by town.</p>
