         <p>"In 1864 there was published in Hartford by the press of <corpname>Williams, Wiley &#x0026; Waterman</corpname> a pamphlet entitled: <title render="italic">A Plan for the Mental, Moral and Physical Development of Children.  An Appeal to the Statesmen and Philanthropist.  The Orphans of the War the Children of the State.</title>  It was signed by <persname>T.S. Gold</persname> and possibly was paid for by him.</p>
         <p>"The General Assembly accepted the new idea and chartered the <corpname>Connecticut Soldiers' Orphans' Home</corpname> in <date>May 1864</date>.  Various locations were considered and a site of twenty acres on Prospect Hill in Cornwall had been accepted when <persname>Edwin Whitney</persname> of Mansfield, 'who had nearly completed a fine large building for a boys' school, offered this building with the farm of fifty acres, all valued at $12,000 or $15,000, as a gift to the Home.'  <persname>Edwin Whitney</persname> conveyed by deed, title to the property to the <corpname>Connecticut Soldiers' Orphans' Home</corpname>, <date>24 September 1866</date>.  Mr. Gold was the first, and apparently the only, secretary of the Home during its existence from October 1866 to May 1875.</p>
         <p>"Even orphans grown up, and in 1875 the Home closed its doors, having first and last provided a home and schooling and religious training in plenty to some two hundred or more orphans of Connecticut men who lost their lives in the Civil War."</p>
