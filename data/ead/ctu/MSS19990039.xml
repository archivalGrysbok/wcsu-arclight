            <p>The history department provides an environment to study the diversity of human experience across time space, and helps students develop skills that enable them to understand the complex ways the past shapes the present and future. Through the department's courses and programs, it seeks not only to train future historians but to produce thoughtful and well-informed citizens. Graduates of the department have successfully pursued careers in business, public service, museum work, public history, law, and various other professions. In addition to offering a major and a minor in history, the department also offers graduate programs, with a Master's and a Ph.D. in Medieval European, Early Modern and Modern Europe, United States and Latin American history.</p>
            <p>More information about the department and its faculty, programs and events is available on its
