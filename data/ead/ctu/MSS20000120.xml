         <p>
            <persname>Dudley Jordan Stickels</persname>, born <date>9 March 1917</date>, in <geogname>Torrington, Conncecticut</geogname>, was by  trade a carpenter and a salesman.  His love, however, was the railroad.  Stickels collected and sold model railroad equipment, which led to his founding of an HO gauge model railroad club.  He enjoyed visiting the <corpname>New York, New Haven, &#x0026; Hartford Railroad</corpname> station in Torrington to admire the passing trains.  He invested a great deal of his energy in collecting materials relating to the history of the <corpname>Central New England Railway</corpname> (CNE), which was at  that time no longer in operation.  His research interests were in that  railroad line's history, routes, and equipment, and specifically in its  steam locomotives.  As a result of Stickels's study of the CNE, he began a substantial collection of steam locomotive photographs, some of which were used by railroad history author <persname>Lucius Beebe</persname>.  <persname>Dudley Stickels</persname> died in <geogname>North Carolina</geogname> in <date>1992</date>.</p>
         <p>Other railroads represented in this collection were gradually merged with the <corpname>Central New England Railway</corpname>.  The CNE merged with the <corpname>New York, New Haven &#x0026; Hartford Railroad</corpname> in 1927.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The Stickels Photograph Collection contains 639 negatives and black and white photographic prints.  The majority of the images were taken between the 1880s and the 1930s, with just one from the 1940s and only two from the 1950s.  A majority of the images are of steam locomotives from various New England railroads, although the <corpname>Central New England Railway</corpname> steam locomotives are the most heavily  represented.  Also in the collection are images of railroad stations and yards, wreck scenes, bridges, and work scenes.  Some of the more unique images include a negative image of a map of the <geogname>Hartford, Connecticut</geogname>, to <geogname>Springfield, Massachusetts</geogname>, rail line, as well as a promotional  photographic print displaying the interior of a new passenger car.</p>

         <p>The photographs were originally organized in albums.  Each negative and photograph print was given a unique identifying number and placed in an archival quality sleeve and box.  Each image was then described in an in-house (Access) database.</p>
         <p>The unique identifying numbers were assigned to the images as they were removed from the album pages.  Neither the placement of images on the pages nor the arrangement of the pages in the albums appeared to have any order.</p>
