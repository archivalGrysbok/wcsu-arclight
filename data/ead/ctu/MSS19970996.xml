            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract:">The American Brass Company was founded in 1893 with the consolidation of five existing brass mills in the Waterbury, Connecticut area. Intended as a holding company, American Brass absorbed the following companies: Plume &amp; Atwood Manufacturing, Benedict &amp; Burnham Manufacturing, Waterbury Brass, Scoville Manufacturing, Holmes, Booth and Haydens, and Coe Brass Manufacturing. The collection dates from circa 1800 to 1978 and provides a unique view of one of the major brass producers in the history of the United States.

            <head>History</head>
            <p>The story of the development of the brass mills in the 
                <geogname>Naugatuck Valley</geogname> is the story of 19th century entrepreneurs who would found one firm, merge with another, then reorganize again to form new ventures. The 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname> was no exception; it was founded from many segments of the industry including the 
                <corpname>Aaron Benedict Company</corpname> (est. 1812) and the various Coe companies.</p>
            <p>Officially, the 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname> began 7 June 1893, when a group of men from five of the six brass mills in the 
                <geogname>Waterbury, Connecticut</geogname>, met to consolidate their interests. The new company was intended to be a holding company for the following operations: 
                <corpname>Plume &amp; Atwood Manufacturing Company</corpname>, 
                <corpname>Benedict &amp; Burnham Manufacturing Company</corpname>, 
                <corpname>Waterbury Brass Company</corpname>, 
                <corpname>Scoville Manufacturing Company</corpname>, 
                <corpname>Holmes, Booth and Haydens</corpname>, and 
                <corpname>Coe Brass Manufacturing Company</corpname>. However, it was to be another six years (1 March 1899) before the charter was accepted and the company finally organized. Even so, the principal companies could not agree upon remanufacturing activities. All of the companies, with the exception of the 
                <corpname>Waterbury Brass Company</corpname> and the 
                <corpname>Coe Brass Manufacturing Company</corpname>, withdrew from the newly formed consolidation. The 
                <corpname>Ansonia Brass &amp; Copper Company</corpname> (of the Phelps Dodge family) joined the remaining two, and on 14 December 1899 the three companies--
                <corpname>Ansonia Brass &amp; Copper</corpname>, 
                <corpname>Waterbury Brass</corpname> and 
                <corpname>Coe Brass Manufacturing</corpname>--formed the 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname>. By 1901, 
                <corpname>Benedict &amp; Burnham</corpname> and 
                <corpname>Holmes, Booth and Haydens</corpname> had rejoined the venture and the 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname> was on its way.</p>
            <p>The next two decades would bring major reorganizations to the company. On 1 January 1912, the holding company became an operating company and the associated companies were now divisions of the parent, 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname>. In 1922, the 
                <corpname>Anaconda Copper Mining Company</corpname> (of 
                <geogname>Montana</geogname>) acquired American Brass, although the company retained its own identity until 1960 when the name was changed to 
                <corpname>Anaconda American Brass</corpname>.</p>
            <p>The 
                <corpname>Anaconda Company</corpname> merged with 
                <corpname>Atlantic Richfield</corpname> in 1977. The American Brass files housed at the corporate archives were transferred to 
                <geogname>Los Angeles, CA</geogname>, in 1981 when the headquarters of 
                <corpname>Anaconda American Brass Company</corpname> were moved from 
                <geogname>Waterbury, Connecticut</geogname> to 
                <geogname>Rolling Meadows, Illinois</geogname>. The name of the division was subsequently changed to 
                <corpname>ARCO Metals</corpname>. No administrative correspondence or records groups remained at Waterbury and the collection was divided into logical series at the corporate archives.</p>

Mr. Judd, a former president of the company, worked on this project from 1942 until 1959, when ill health forced him to put it aside for a time. He was assisted in his research by 
                <persname>Russell H. Pope</persname>, an American Brass employee since 1912. The files contain clippings, anecdotes and general background information on the 
                <corpname>American Brass Company</corpname> and the brass industry in general. Dates on the folders may refer to the event noted and not the actual document itself.</p>
