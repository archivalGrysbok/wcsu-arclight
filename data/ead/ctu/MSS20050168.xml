            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>
                <persname>Mary Ann Hoberman</persname> was born on August 12, 1930 in 
                <geogname>Stamford, Connecticut</geogname> to 
                <persname>Dorothy Miller</persname> and 
                <persname>Milton Freedman</persname>. She attended Stamford public schools, where she wrote for her school newspapers and edited her high school yearbook. In 1951 she received a B.A. in history from 
                <corpname>Smith College</corpname>, and later that year married her husband, 
                <persname>Norman Hoberman</persname>. In 1986 she received an M.A. in English from 
                <corpname>Yale University</corpname>.</p>
            <p>Hoberman has taught writing and literature from the elementary through the college level. She co-founded and performed with both "The Pocket People," a children's theatre group, and "Women's Voices," a group giving dramatized poetry readings. Although Hoberman did not write her first book until 1957, her interest in writing children's stories began when she was only five years old. And since the publication of her first book, 
                <title render="italic">All My Shoes Come in Two's</title>, her primary occupation has been writing children's books. Her books have received a National Book Award, a Society of School Librarians International Best Book award, a National Parenting Publications Award gold medal, and the 2003 Poetry for Children Award of the National Council of Teachers of English. In 2008 she was named the Children's Poet Laureate by the 
                <corpname>Poetry Foundation</corpname>.</p>
            <p>As a critically acclaimed author of over forty books for children, including 
                <title render="italic">A House is a House for Me</title>, Hoberman seeks to help her readers never forget what it felt like to be a child. Hoberman has authored numerous children's books since 1957, and has recently began to branch out and write novels. The Hoberman's have lived in 
                <geogname>Greenwich, Connecticut</geogname> for over fifty years in a house designed by 
                <persname>Norman Hoberman</persname>.</p>
