Although van Strum left in 1968, Hawley continued on with the press in his spare time, eventually publishing over 80 books in addition to numerous keepsakes and broadsides, featuring authors such as David Meltzer, Josephine Miles, Lew Welch, Philip Lamantia, and many others.  Oyez publications were highly regarded for the simplicity and elegance of their design; many were produced in collaboration with printer Graham Mackintosh.</abstract>

         <head>History</head>
         <p>
            <persname>Robert Hawley</persname> was born in 1929 in <geogname>Stockbridge, Wisconsin</geogname>.  He was a student at <corpname>Black Mountain College</corpname> in 1956, shortly before that institution closed its doors.  Although he already had an M.A. in  English and was an aspiring poet, <persname>Charles Olson</persname>  discouraged him in this regard, but suggested to Hawley that he give  publishing a try.  By 1957, Hawley was in <geogname>Berkeley, California</geogname>, working as a bookseller specializing in Western  Americana at the <corpname>Holmes Book Company</corpname>.</p>
         <p>In 1964, Robert Hawley and <persname>Stevens van Strum</persname> started the <corpname>Oyez Press</corpname> by soliciting poems from  noteworthy American poets to be published in a series of broadsides, effectively pioneering this publishing medium for poetry.  This initial  series consisted of ten broadsides, by such poets as <persname>William Everson</persname> (<persname>Brother Antoninus</persname>), <persname>Gary Snyder</persname>, <persname>Charles Olson</persname>, <persname>Michael McClure</persname>, and others.  The first Oyez book was a collection of poetry by <persname>David Meltzer</persname>.  It was during this period that Hawley began his business relationship with printer <persname>Graham Mackintosh</persname>.  The Oyez poetry  editions were well regarded for the simplicity and elegance of their  designs.  Although not all Oyez books were designed by Mackintosh,  several of his designs did receive awards, including an edition of  William Everson's Single Source that was selected as one of the 50  books of the year by the <corpname>American Institute of Graphic Arts</corpname>.</p>
         <p>By the late 1960s, Oyez was publishing about ten books a year, even after Stevens van Strum departed the concern (around 1968), and even though Hawley continued with his day job at the Holmes Book Company.  Although the print runs of Oyez books were limited at the cost of the books was kept low, the press did well so long as it had standing orders from universities and book stores with an interest in poetry and rare books.  However, inventories began to mount and the cash reserves of the press began to dwindle in time.  Hawley eventually turned over the distribution of the Oyez titles to <corpname>Serendipity Books</corpname>.</p>
         <p>In 1978, Hawley opened his own book shop, the <corpname>Ross Valley Book  Company</corpname>, in <geogname>Albany, California</geogname>  (near Oakland).  Even though the Oyez press continued to publish sporadically during the next few years, money troubles seriously limited the pace of Hawley's publishing projects.  While a collection of poems by <persname>Samuel Charters</persname> was published in 1992,  it is the only book-length project put out by Oyez since 1987.   However, friends of the press have also received periodic keepsakes and  pamphlets with the Oyez imprint over the years, a number of which are  preserved in this collection.</p>

         <head>Scope and Content</head>
         <p>The collection consists largely of Robert Hawley's personal papers and records with regard to the Oyez Press from 1963 to 1988.  The largest portion of the collection deals with project records of Oyez productions, including manuscripts, galleys, proofs, and production-specific correspondence.  Additional correspondence preserved by Hawley documents his relationships with poets such as <persname>William Everson</persname>, <persname>Mary Fabilli</persname>, and <persname>David Meltzer</persname>.  The press correspondence also  provides a wide range of perspectives on the San Francisco Poetry scene  in the late 1960s and early 1970s -- Hawley preserved many mailings from other publishers and announcements of poetry readings.  Additionally, the collection contains business records including sales ledgers and receipts for a number of years prior to Oyez turning over distribution to a third party.  The collection further consists of some of Robert Hawley's personal papers and one box of wood block engravings used for various Oyez projects.</p>
         <p>The Dodd Center holds a comprehensive range of Oyez publications.   The published versions of projects described in this collection are  listed in HOMER, the Libraries online catalog.
