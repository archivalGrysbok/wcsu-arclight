            <p>The University Editorial Office was opened in 1922 under the direction of 
                <persname>Walter Stemmons</persname>, College Editor. In 1954, after Mr. Stemmons retired, the office was renamed to reflect its broadened responsibilities. The Division of Communication, directed by 
                <persname>John H. Gleason</persname>, had four subdivisions: General News (News Office), Sports Information, University Photography (Photo Lab), and Publications-Central Duplicating. In 1962, 
                <persname>Donald Friedman</persname> became head of the office. In 1964, the name was again changed, this time to Office of Public Information and Publications. This office absorbed University News, Sports Information, Photography, Publications, and Central Duplicating. In 1967, 
                <persname>Raymond J. Buck</persname> became Director of University Publications when the Office became the Office of Public Information (OPI). Friedman continued to work for Buck as director of OPI until 1977 when 
                <persname>Walter S. McGowen</persname> became the director. Sports Information was transferred to the Division of Athletics in 1977/1978.</p>
            <p>In 1986, the office was renamed the Office of University Relations and 
                <persname>Karen Grava Williams</persname> was named Director of Institutional Relations. The following year, the office was divided into two offices: Institutional Relations and University Publications.</p>
            <p>Although the responsibilities of the unit have remained the same, by 2005 was known as

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>The records are divided into eight series:</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: Morgue Files</emph> (
                <date>1955-1979</date>) is a general subject file consisting of information on various University activities and functions. The series is divided into three subseries of overlapping dates: 
                <emph render="bold">A: 1955-1958, B: 1958-1967</emph>, and 
                <emph render="bold">C: 1960-1979;</emph> and contains news releases on subjects in completed form and/or rough draft. [Use Series V for news releases.] Subjects include University schools and divisions, branches, summer sessions, honorary degrees, and student activities and organizations. There are also newspaper clippings, photos, commencement files for 1951-1962, a file on President Babbidge (last updated 1963), speeches of President Jorgensen, ROTC files and other University topics. Within each subseries, the files are arranged hierarchically reflecting the administrative reporting lines.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II: Office Files</emph> (
                <date>1918-1978</date>) contains correspondence and information on activities, which were probably the general office files utilized by Stemmons, Gleason, Friedman and McGowen. The series is arranged in two subseries: 
                <emph render="bold">A: 1918-1961 [1956-1960 bulk dates]</emph> and 
                <emph render="bold">B: 1961-1978.</emph> Within each subseries, the files are arranged alphabetically by topic, name, or office.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III: Office of Sports Information</emph> (
                <date>1921-1981</date>)</p>
            <p>Note: The files in this series have been integrated with those transferred by the Athletic Communications Office Records.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV: Scrapbooks</emph> (
                <date>1922-1976</date>) consists of 21 scrapbooks of newspaper clippings. The majority of the clippings are of school sports events, although some pertain to social and other events. Pencilled on many clippings is the name and date of the paper; most are from local newspapers. The scrapbooks are in poor condition; the papers is brittle, and clippings are deteriorating and becoming unglued.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V: News Releases</emph> (
                <date>1954-present</date>) contains press, radio, and television news releases on University topics such as University offices and departments, students' achievements, faculty honors, new programs, Loeb Awards, and activities at both the Benson Museum of Art and Jorgensen Auditorium. The news releases are filed in chronological order by month. Except for boxes 36-39, the press releases are not separated from the radio and television releases. Also included in this series are news release logs, 1961-1983, which can be used as a topical index for these years. Series I, box 6 contains logs for 1957-1960. Series II, box 9 contains logs for 1973-1974.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VI: Biographical Files</emph> (
                <date>1957-78 [1965-71]</date>) contains information on University faculty, staff, and administration. The files consist of press releases and drafts, publication lists, announcements of achievements, awards and activities, as well as a few photographs. The series is arranged alphabetically by name.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VII: Morgue</emph> (
                <date>1963-1984</date>) is a general subject file consisting of information on various University activities and functions. The series is further divided into two 
                <emph render="bold">subseries</emph> of overlapping dates: 
                <emph render="bold">1963-1979 [1974-1978]</emph> and 
                <emph render="bold">1974-1984 [1979-1983].</emph> Within each subseries, the files are arranged hierarchically. (This series continues Series I.)</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VIII: University Presidents</emph> is arranged in three 
                <emph render="bold">subseries: Albert N. Jorgensen, Homer D. Babbidge</emph>, and
