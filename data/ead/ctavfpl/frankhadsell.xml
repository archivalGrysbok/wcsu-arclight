<head>Biography</head>
<p>Frank Marcy Hadsell was born on March 31, 1858 in Avon, CT. He married Mary Bowen (1861-1893) on October 21, 1891. Mary Hadsell died two years later on June 18, 1893; they had no children. Hadsell's parents were Jane Marcy Hadsell (1838-1926) and Samuel Hadsell (1833-1900). Frank Hadsell has two brothers and three sisters:</p>
<p>- Ida Josephine Hadsell (November 25, 1861-July 21, 1908) married Sidney Redpath in 1883. They lived in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>- Eva Jane (January 18, 1865-December 12, 1925) married William Woods in 1898. No children. </p>
<p>-Hattie Isabell Hadsell (January 15, 1868-1947) married John Carrier (died in 1918) of Avon in 1905. Lived on Nod Road. She sold the Nod Road farm to John W. Alsop in 1919. Second marriage to Edgar Fish in 1921, and lived in Hartford. </p>
<p>-Clinton B. Hadsell (November 12, 1871-November 13, 1947) married Lavinia Chloe Miller in 1902. No children. </p>
<p>- Willys (Will) Herbert Hadsell (March 18, 1875- December 9, 1953) lived in Avon. Married Minnie Thurston, June 8, 1904. No children. </p>
<p>Frank Hadsell resided in Avon, CT his entire life. Frank lived with his mother most of his life, except during his brief marriage to Mary. He held a variety of jobs, notably as superintendent of the shops at Climax Fuse Company. In his spare time, he intermittently operated a small variety store called "The News Office," adjacent to his home on East Main Street. He had some success with selling postcards of Avon made from his own photographs. </p>
<p>Frank was a loner who was very close to his mother. He was also an occasional photographer who focused on solitary subjects mostly in Avon. In the late 1920s and into the 1940s, Frank compiled his recollections to cope with his grief over the loss of his mother. The 44 handwritten booklets contain extraordinary details of his family and descriptions of Avon. </p>
<p>Frank died in 1949, at the age of 90. His obituary in the Farmington Valley Herald on February 10, 1949, noted that he was Avon's oldest citizen. Funeral services were held at the Avon Congregational Church, with Rev. Watson Woodruff officiating. </p>
