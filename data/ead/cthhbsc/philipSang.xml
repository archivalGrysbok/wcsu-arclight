<head>Biography</head>
<p>Philip David Sang, 1902-1975, was a successful corporate executive with an interest in American history and, especially, the history of minorities. Consequently he became a collector of manuscripts and other archival materials that illuminate 18th and 19th century American conflicts. Early in his career as a collector, Sang concentrated on materials from the Civil War era. This early work broadened into a study of the development of American freedom, both in ideals and practice. His personal collection included materials from the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. In his later career Sang spent much of his time with documents from the enslaved African American experience in slavery and in the resistance that culminated in its abolition.</p>
<p>Sang donated manuscript collections to Brandeis University, Yale University, the Illinois State Historical Museum, Southern Illinois University, and the Chicago Public Library. He saved many historically significant manuscripts from being sold at auction and almost lost to researchers and scholars.</p>
<p>After Sang's death, his widow, Elsie Olin Sang, sold many of his remaining manuscript and archival collections in five sales at Sotheby's between 1978 and 1981. But Sang kept the letters and documents in the Stowe Center's collection out of these sales and left them in his will to his young grandchildren. Sang though these documents exemplified Harriet Beecher Stowe's philosophy and her enduring legacy.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Sang Collection consists of letters, autographs, and mottos written by Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896), internationally famous best-selling author of Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) the antislavery novel that propelled the American abolition movement. Stowe published 30 other books, multiple articles, guides, and poems and was the most famous American woman author of her day. Sang thought the collection's 12 Harriet Beecher Stowe letters, written between 1850 and 1896, exemplified her philosophy and its startling effect on worldwide public opinion. Stowe's letters were written from Brunswick, ME; Andover, MA; Hartford, CT; London and Liverpool, England; Geneva, Switzerland; Inverness, Scotland; Mandarin, FL; and other unspecified places. </p>
<p>The collection also includes material relating to Josiah Henson, a model for the character Uncle Tom in Uncle Tom's Cabin. The Henson material consists of an autograph dated April 2, 1879 and a typed copy of letter by Henson dated June 1, 1881, written from Dresden, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>In addition the collection contains: (1) a letter written from Hartford, CT by Stowe's daughter, Eliza Tyler Stowe (1836-1912), on her mother's behalf concerning Josiah Henson; (2) a photocopy of a Kentucky bill of sale dated April 13, 1840 for an enslaved woman named Rachael purchased by Abraham Lincoln; and (3) an anonymous line-by-line comparison of textual differences between the Uncle Tom's Cabin newspaper serial and the published novel, Chapter 4.</p>
