<head>Biography</head>
<p>John Raymond Howard (1837-1926) was an editor, publisher, and partner in J. B. Ford &amp; Company (1868-1876) and its successor Fords, Howard &amp; Hulbert (1877-?), which published Henry Ward Beecher's The Christian Union. Many of Beecher's own writings as well as his sister, Harriet Beecher Stowe's novels were serialized in The Christian Union. John Raymond Howard was the son of John Tasker Howard (1808-1888), a founder of Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn Heights, NY, who became a close friend of, and financial advisor to, both Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe. John Raymond Howard's mother, Susan Taylor Raymond Howard (1812-1906), was also a close friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe.</p>

<p>This collection consists primarily of 67 letters written by Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) to her publisher, John R. Howard ("dear Jack"), dated between the 1860s-1880s. These letters provide in-depth information about the author's family and business affairs in her later career, including discussion of articles written for The Christian Union, novels and other books, foreign editions of her novels, her public readings and lectures, and financial matters. Many letters concern the personal affairs of the Stowe and Howard families. Stowe was a close friend of Howard's father and mother. Stowe's letters were written from Amherst, Andover, Boston, Northampton Depot, and Stockbridge, MA, Hartford, CT, and Mandarin, FL, as well as other places not specified.</p>
<p>The collection includes three letters written to John R. Howard from Peekskill, NY by Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887), as well as an engraving of Beecher. It also includes one letter each written by:(1) Edward W. Bok (1863-1930), editor and author, from Brooklyn, NY to John T. Howard about a memorial book on Henry Ward Beecher.(2) Maria Weston Chapman (1806-1885), abolitionist from Staten Island, NY to John R.
