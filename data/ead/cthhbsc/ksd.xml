<head>Biography</head>
<p>Katharine Seymour Day (1870-1964) was born into a Victorian family of New England prominence and prestige. She was a grandniece of the world famous antislavery novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe and granddaughter of the suffragist Isabella Beecher Hooker. Her father, attorney John C. Day, served as special secretary for Connecticut governor William Buckingham.</p>
<p>Katharine Day s earliest years were spent in Hartford but in 1887, her family moved to Europe. For the next seven years, the Days lived abroad, and Katharine and her sister Alice were introduced to society at the royal courts of Germany and Great Britain. More importantly to Day was her introduction to modern art. In 1915 and 1916, she relocated to California where she painted and took summer courses at the University of California-Berkeley. The following year at age 47, she returned to the east coast to enroll as a freshman at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she completed her undergraduate work and received a Masters degree in psychology.</p>
<p>In 1924 Day returned to Hartford. She purchased her great aunt Harriet Beecher Stowe s house, planted colonial revival style gardens, turned the garage into an artists studio and continued to paint, travel, and study. She received a graduate degree in history from Trinity College in 1936, when she was 66.  </p>
<p>Katharine Day s interests and actions conformed to the ideals of the Progressive Movement, and like her famous Beecher relatives she spoke out on the issues of her day. She marched for women s suffrage in New England, New York City, and London and helped organize the efforts of the New York Women s Municipal League to end the corrupt rule of Tammany Hall.  In Hartford, she focused on urban planning, seeking to combine the need for modern amenities with a strong sense of historic preservation. She became a public health advocate by calling for an end to the open burning of garbage and refuse, and the construction of city incinerators. Believing that parks and gardens should be maintained for the health and benefit of the public, and that art education should be available to everyone, Day worked to restore the Corning Fountain in Bushnell Park, and helped create The Childrens Museum in West Hartford where all children could learn about art and history. She spearheaded local preservation efforts, from relocating the Wadsworth Stable from Hartford to Lebanon to save it from destruction, to organizing the Friends of Hartford to prevent the Mark Twain House from being razed for development. And she created and generously endowed the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center, saving not only the home and many possessions of Harriet Beecher Stowe, but also the neighboring Queen Anne home now known as the Day House and the papers of the extended Beecher, Stowe, Hooker, Seymour, and Day families.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Katharine Seymour Day Collection is the largest of all the manuscript collections the Stowe Center possesses. The heart of the collection is Katharine Seymour Day s personal papers and documents, consisting of correspondence between Day and a large group of friends, associates, and family, as well as papers relating to her educational pursuits and to the many public projects and philanthropic activities in which she was involved. A wide variety of societies and organizations are represented, covering such subjects and causes as temperance, women s suffrage, politics, municipal government, art, city planning, history, and gardening. Day lived in many places during her life and traveled extensively but the bulk of her correspondence focuses on Hartford, CT, New York City, NY, Berkeley, CA, and Cambridge, MA as well as England, France, and Germany.</p>
<p>The collection also includes extensive archives of papers of the Beecher, Stowe, Hooker, Seymour, and Day families. These papers provide a detailed and rich trove of information on the history of Connecticut and of Hartford in the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. There are letters and other papers relating to the many prominent and influential members of these families and their well known contemporaries and near contemporaries. Among the latter are authors Samuel L. Clemens, Charles Dickens, and Richard Henry Dana, early feminists and suffragists Josephine Butler, Carrie Chapman Catt, Susan B. Anthony, Dorothea Dix, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Margaret Sanger, scientists Havelock Ellis and Alfred Russell Wallace, and actors Helen Hayes, Katherine Hepburn, and William Gillette. Also represented in the collection are Jane Addams, Mary Baker Eddy, William Lloyd Garrison, Booker T. Washington, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, among many others.</p>
<p>Finally, the collection provides extensive information about the founding of the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center and West Hartford Childrens Museum, as well as Day s organizing and fundraising for the Friends of Hartford, which purchased and renovated the Mark Twain House.</p>
