<abstract label="Abstract">Most of the documents in the Higginson Collection are letters written or forwarded to Thomas Wentworth Higginson during a single week in April 1861, just after the start of the Civil War. These documents (1) concern recruitment and provision of financial or other kinds of support for an ultimately unsuccessful plan for an abolitionist guerrilla force to operate in western Maryland and Virginia; (2) secret service and espionage activities against the Confederate states; and (3) plans to free enslaved people and promote the early abolition of slavery.  There are also five letters to Higginson dating from 1848 and 1850, including from authors Charles Francis Adams and Richard Henry Dana and botanist Edward Tuckerman.</abstract>

<head>Biography</head>

<p>The heart of the Higginson collection is 18 letters written or referred to Thomas Wentworth Higginson, plus two other documents, all dated during an eight-day period from April 20 to April 28, 1861. These papers show how certain radical abolitionists saw the war, its causes and goals. The letters and documents specifically relate to Higginson's plan to organize a private military force of Kansas men and participants in John Brown's raid to operate on the Pennsylvania-Maryland border and in western Virginia. The major goal of the operation was to divert Confederate forces from attacking Washington, DC and ensure that Maryland remained in the Union. The 18 letters are from those seeking to join, fund, or otherwise support Higginson's guerrilla band. One letter from Franklin B. Sanborn also discusses funding and other support for Harriet Tubman's work rescuing enslaved people and whether to foment an immediate insurrection by the enslaved in Maryland and Virginia. In addition there are letters from two of John Brown's children, John Jr. and Annie, and other Brown backers and supporters.</p>
<p>The two other documents dating from the same week are a letter of introduction, signed by four prominent sponsors, attesting to Higginson's suitability to receive funds and engage in 'secret service work' and Higginson's own notes, dated April 26, 1861, of his interview with Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin about the guerrilla project. Curtin did not support the operation, fearing it would spark a border war that would alienate Unionist support in Western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. As a result of the governor's negative attitude, Higginson's plan was not implemented.</p>
<p>One other 1861 letter to Higginson, dated September 11, 1861, refers to the failure of the private expedition and discusses the idea of organizing a private govt. expedition that includes black men who can fight. This letter may relate to plans and discussions for the black Union regiment Higginson commanded from 1862 to 1864, the 1st Colored South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment.</p>
<p>Five earlier letters complete the collection: two, dated June 16, 1848 and May 25, 1850, from author Charles Francis Adams concerning the organization and activities of the Free Soil Party, a single-issue party opposed to expanding slavery into western territories, one from leading Massachusetts abolitionist Edmund Quincy, dated November 4, 1850, asking Higginson for a contribution to The Liberty Bell, an abolitionist magazine published annually from 1838 to 1858 of which Quincy was editor, one, dated September 5, 1848, from author Richard H. Dana, telling Higginson that he cannot leave home due to his wife's serious illness, and one from botanist and Amherst professor Edward Tuckerman, dated May 19, 1849, concerning Higginson's interest in botany.</p>
<p>The letters were written from a range of towns in Massachusetts, Boston, Concord, Dedham, Grantville, Jamaica Plain, Leominster, Milford, Newburyport, Quincy, and Taunton as well as Brattleboro, Vermont, Manchester, New Hampshire, and Providence, Rhode Island. John Brown, Jr.'s letter was written from Jefferson, Ashtabula County, Ohio.</p>

<head>Biography</head>
<p>Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823-1911) was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts into a distinguished family whose ancestors trace back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He attended Harvard College and graduated from the Harvard Divinity School. A Unitarian minister, he was involved in a number of radical political causes and activities, supporting abolition, socialism, and feminism including active support of abolitionist John Brown as well as membership in the Free Soil party. He was engaged with almost all of the most significant political struggles and associated with the leading literary figures of the 19th century. 
Before the Civil War, Higginson was a radical abolitionist, spoke passionately against the Fugitive Slave Law, and twice participated in violent plans to rescue captured slaves who were jailed awaiting return to their masters in the South. In 1856, Higginson carried rifles and ammunition to Kansas to arm settlers opposed to Kansas becoming a slave state. When John Brown was arrested after the failure of the raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859, Higginson was part of a group that planned an aborted attempt to break him out of jail.
 In the first weeks of the Civil War, Higginson attempted to reunite men who had fought in Kansas and who participated in Brown's Harper's Ferry raid in a guerrilla force to invade western Virginia and distract Confederate forces from Washington. He abandoned this plan when he failed to win support from Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin (Mary T. Higginson, Thomas Wentworth Higginson: The Story of His Life. 1914).
In 1862, Higginson became the commanding officer of the first Black regiment in the Civil War. His book, Army Life in a Black Regiment (1870) chronicles that experience. In 1867, Higginson published in the Atlantic Monthly the first substantial collection of Black spirituals to appear in America.
After the Civil War, Higginson was an important leader in the women's movement, publishing many essays on women's rights. With feminist Lucy Stone and others, he helped found the American Woman Suffrage Association and was co-editor for 14 years of the organization's Woman's Journal. He was also associated with other feminist leaders, including Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Isabella Beecher Hooker, sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Higginson had a long association with the Atlantic Monthly, contributing a number of articles, essays, and poems. He is well-known today as the editor who corresponded with Emily Dickinson, published a memoir of her, and, with Mabel Loomis Todd, co-edited Dickinson's first published collections of poetry. He was poetry editor of The Nation for 26 years. Higginson's active publishing career lasted until 1909.
