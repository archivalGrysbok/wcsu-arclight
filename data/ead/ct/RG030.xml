<head>Historical Note</head>
<p>
The Council of Defense was Connecticut's agency for coordinating its war activities during World War I. Appointed on 26 April 1917 by Gov. Marcus Holcomb under the authority of the emergency act (Chap. 44, Public Acts of 1917), it initially consisted of eleven members representing industry, labor, the professions and the military, with Richard M. Bissell as Chairman.<emph render="super">1</emph> The first meeting was held on 8 May 1917 and the agency was discontinued in March 1919.
</p>
<p>
At first the Council was organized in a series of appointed committees to deal with the various areas of concern, such as food supply, fuel conservation, transportation, military and naval affairs and publicity. A small secretarial and administrative staff was headed by Thomas Hewes. As the work expanded, a number of the committees acquired their own full-time staffs and became "Departments", and a stronger executive control was established through the creation of an Executive Department headed by Joseph M. Alsop, a member of the Council.
</p>
<p>
Much of the Council's attention was devoted to coordinating, supporting and publicizing the work of other agencies. Leading officials of many other war agencies served also on Council of Defense committees, and in some cases the Council supplied staff assistance and other help to United States agencies in Connecticut or to other Connecticut agencies in the war effort. The Military Census, which was the first Connecticut war agency (Feb.. 7, 1917), was represented on the Council by its director, and the Committee on Food Supply, which preceded the Council by a couple of weeks, became one of its departments. The Council collaborated closely with the United States Food Administration, the United States Fuel Administration, the United States Employment Service, the Committee on Public Information and, of course, the Council of National Defense. Efforts were made to organize town "war bureaux" to coordinate war work on a local scale; these met with varying success and little record of their work survives. Auxiliary committees on the county level also existed; the files of the New London one are here.
</p>
<p>
Mention must be made of the important Woman's Division. Organized first as a state committee of the Council of National Defense Woman's Committee, it gradually, by the summer of 1918, assumed the status of a department in the Connecticut Council. As that occurred, some of its earlier programs (Americanization, child welfare, "commercial economy", etc.) were taken over by other units of the Council, but the Woman's Division continued to be represented on those committees and to play an important role in all the agency's work.

When the war ended, the Council of Defense wound up its own activities. The committees were disbanded, most of the staff turned to other work, and the records were turned over to the State Library for preservation. The records became the responsibility of the War Records Department of the State Library,
which was the successor to the Historical Records Department (headed by George Godard, the State Librarian) of the Council of Defense. 
</p>

<head>Processing Information</head>
<p>
After arrival at the State Library, the records were moved about many times and became almost inextricably mixed with other war-related materials (see Related Material section). While some measure of order has been restored, there are large groups of papers that are still unarranged and are described only in general terms such as "Collected" or "Miscellaneous" materials. 
Despite the remaining difficulties in using them, however, this record group remains an extraordinarily valuable collection of materials on Connecticut history during the critical period of World War I.

	<unittitle>12. "Collected materials"</unittitle>
	<unitdate datechar="creation">1917-1919</unitdate>
 </did>	
	<bioghist><p>This series, like others titled "Collected materials", appears to have been accumulated and filed over a period extending perhaps as late as 1924, although nearly all the papers originated during the war period.
The Historical Records Department, begun in the fall of 1918, had the responsibility for "gathering in the files of correspondence and other matter in the possession of the various committees whose work is being wound up." A subject outline
was drawn up to guide the collecting and filing (see Wriston, <title><emph render="italic">Connecticut State Council of Defense</emph></title>, pp. 90-91). The ambitious plan was not carried out fully, 
but the War Records Department of the State Library apparently did recieve, maintain and enlarge a substantial body of material resulting from this effort. Lists in record Group 12, Entry VII, 8, throw light on this. In the course of many moves of the 
collection over the years and as a result of poor storage conditions and neglect, the records became badly disarranged. The segments that have now been found, though
probably once part of a single "classified" file, are now associated, so far as possible, with the other papers of the departments to which they refer and from which they came (see below items 19, 20, 32, 36, 37, 42, 43, 59, 63, 64, 70, 72 and 89).</p></bioghist>
	<scopecontent><p>The "collected materials" include a wide range of items: correspondence, memoranda, directives, minutes, account books, press releases, publications, clippings, photographs, flags, banners, posters, blank forms, letterheads, envelopes,
rubber stamps, etc. Many items were acquired in multiple copies, and substantial duplication still exists, both within the "collected materials" and between them and other files. The State Library collated groups of duplicate materials and offered them to other libraries (see RG 12, VII, 3)</p></scopecontent>
