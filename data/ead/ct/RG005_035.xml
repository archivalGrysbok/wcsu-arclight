<emph render="bold">Born: </emph>January 30, 1928, New Britain, Connecticut.<lb/>
<emph render="bold">College: </emph>Trinity College, 1950, University of Connecticut Law School, 1956.<lb/>
<emph render="bold">Political Party: </emph>Republican.<lb/>
<emph render="bold">Offices: </emph>Mayor of New Britain, 1962-1964; New Britain Corporation Counsel, 1965-1966; U.S. Congress, 1967-1971; Governor of Connecticut, 1971-1975; Judge, U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.<lb/>
<emph render="bold">Died: </emph>October 29, 2007, Boynton Beach, Florida.
</p>
<p>
After sixteen years of Democratic control the Republicans won the governor's office once more with the candidacy of Thomas Meskill. A native of New Britain, Meskill graduated from Trinity College in 1950 and then spent three years with the US Air Force. He returned to Connecticut, obtained a law degree, and opened his practice in New Britain in 1956. He married Mary Grady and they had five children.
</p>
<p>
Meskill entered local politics and was elected mayor of New Britain for 1962-1964. He ran for U.S. Congress in 1964, but lost. Two years later he ran again and won, serving from 1967 until 1971 when he became governor. When Governor Dempsey announced his plan to leave office, the Republican Party saw Meskill as its best candidate and he won the nomination with little opposition. A divided Democratic Party helped Meskill win a substantial victory and he began his term as governor in January of 1971.
</p>
<p>
There were several problems for Meskill during his first year in office. One was that he inherited a budget that was well out of balance. The second was that his public image became that of a tough, uncaring governor. Democratic leaders and the news media portrayed Meskill's conservative policies in a negative manner. The young Republicans that he hired to help run his administration were dubbed "Meskill's Kiddie Corps." and he became known as "Tough Tom". The budget battle during the 1971 session of the General Assembly was a tiring one that saw Meskill veto 44 legislative bills. On the last night of the session the Assembly passed an income tax bill that Meskill refused to sign, although he did not veto it either. By August the public's outcry was such that this bill was rescinded and a special session was called to pass a more conventional tax package that raised the sales tax to seven percent. Some achievements included passage of no fault auto insurance, granting 18 years olds the right to vote, adoption of tougher drunk driving laws, and the creation of the Department of Environmental Protection.
</p>
<p>
While Meskill's next three years in office went smoother than his first, and he was able to balance the budget and reduce the sales tax to 6 1/2 percent, he had difficulty overcoming the perception that he ran an austere administration. When an ice storm hit the state in December of 1973 Meskill was on vacation with his family in Vermont. Although he issued orders that allowed state agencies to properly handle the crises, his failure to return to Connecticut was used by the press to make him look bad to the voters. Upset at this bias, as well as a failure to receive credit for his accomplishments while in office, Meskill announced in early 1974 that he would not seek reelection. He was the first governor of Connecticut in more than 50 years who voluntarily limited himself to only one term. Shortly after leaving office Meskill was appointed to be a judge on the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals and was its chief judge before his retirement in 1993.
