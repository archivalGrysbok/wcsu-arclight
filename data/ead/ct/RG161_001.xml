	<head>Historical Note</head>
	<p>The origins of the Connecticut State Police can be traced to the founding of the Law and Order League of Connecticut in 1884. The League was created by citizens who were dissatisfied with the inability, or unwillingness, of local police to enforce the laws of the State of Connecticut, particularly laws relating to intoxicating liquors. Over the years, League activities were extended to cover gambling and prostitution laws. In 1895 the League was incorporated, and in 1897 became quasi-official when the Governor was granted power to appoint four agents for the League. The League, however, was not effective due to its private status and the perception that they were meddling in law enforcement.</p>

	<p>In 1903, Governor Abiram Chamberlain signed a legislative act that authorized the creation of the Connecticut State Police. Five state police commissioners were appointed to lay the groundwork for the first state police department with Thomas F. Egan named the agency's first superintendent. In 1905, the superintendent of the State Police also became the State Fire Marshall.</p>

	<p>Over the years, the General Assembly has enacted many laws changing the organization, size, and duties of the State Police Department. In 1909 the State Police were given control over motion picture houses. In 1911 the Police were authorized to assist towns in enforcing motor vehicle laws and the State Police Superintendent was given the additional title of Superintendent of Weights and Measures. In 1919, the Superintendent was authorized to license amusement parks and to issue permits for concealed weapons. In 1920 the State Police were given joint control, with local fire marshals, over the licensing to manufacture, store, transport or sell explosives.</p>

	<p>In 1921, six trooper barracks were established in rural areas, where the large majority of criminal investigations were being conducted. In 1927, the number of commissioners was reduced to one full-time salaried person appointed by the Governor. In 1931, the number of State Troopers was increased to 175 with 30 troopers assigned exclusively for highway patrol.</p>

	<p>In 1939, Governor Raymond E. Baldwin appointed Edward J. Hickey as State Police Commissioner. Commissioner Hickey made several changes to the State Police including increasing the size of the department, using clearly marked police vehicles on state roads (to remind motorists of police presence) and updating the Bureau of Identification (the forerunner to the present day Forensics Lab). Hickey also established a State Police Training Academy, started gun-owner registrations, and used the nation's first motor vehicle radar (1946).</p>

	<p>In 1947, the State Fire Marshall was required to establish a fire safety code. In 1951 the Commissioner of State Police was authorized to organize an emergency service, including necessary equipment and the creation of an auxiliary police force, to protect life and minority in case of fire, explosion, and floods. In 1963 the size of the State Police force increased to 500 men and 12 women; with a Criminal Intelligence Division created in 1967.</p>

	<p>In 1977, a major reorganization of state government was started, saw the State Police Department made into one division of an overall Department of Safety, effective January 1, 1979. The Commissioner of Public Safety, who remained as administrative head and commanding officer of the State Police Division replaced the Commissioner of State Police. Also in 1977 a Statewide Narcotics Task Force was established within the State Police Division. And in 1986 a Legalized Gambling Investigation Unit was also established.</p>
	
	<p>The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) was established July 1, 2011 in an effort by the state to decrease the number of state agencies and reduce costs. DESPP is composed of six divisions: the Division of State Police, the Division of Statewide Emergency Telecommunications, the Division of Scientific Services, the Police Officer Standards and Training Council, the Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, and the Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.</p>
