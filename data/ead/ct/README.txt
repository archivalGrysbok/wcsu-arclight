PUT YOUR EAD FILES in THIS FOLDER
---------------------------------

This is the directory for your EAD file. Hopefully they will get indexed every
night, so if you add a file or remove a file it will show up the next day. If
you have any question let me know.

You might have trouble editing files directly from this folder depending on
you editor. If so, just drag the file to your desktop and when through editing
drag it back. 

Let me know if you have any problems.
