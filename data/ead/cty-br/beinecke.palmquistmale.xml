         <p>The biographical information in this finding aid derived mainly from word processing files originally created by Palmquist and his assistants.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing in 2011-2012, including rehousing and organization. Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>

         <head>Peter E. Palmquist (1936-2003)</head>
         <p>A photographer, collector, and historian of photography, Peter Eric Palmquist was born in Oakland, California on September 23, 1936. In 1944, he moved with his family to Ferndale, California, and he spent most of his life in Humboldt County. During adolescence, Palmquist trained himself in photography. He served in the United States Army as a photographer from 1955 to 1959, mainly with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Paris, France. Palmquist worked briefly as a photographer for the state government of California from 1959 to 1961. From 1961 until his retirement in 1989, Palmquist worked as a staff photographer for Humboldt State University, Arcata, California, where he also graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art in 1965.</p>
         <p>From 1971 until his death, Palmquist collected textual materials and hundreds of thousands of photographic items documenting the practice and occupation of photography from its beginning through the turn of the twenty-first century. He had particular interests in early California photographers, photographers of the American West, and women photographers.</p>
         <p>A self-trained researcher and historian of photography, Palmquist organized more than a hundred exhibitions and wrote more than three hundred articles and a hundred monographs. He was a founding editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Daguerreian Annual
            </title>, and a president of the National Stereoscopic Association.</p>
         <p>Palmquist died January 13, 2003, in Oakland.</p>

                  <p>This subseries chiefly consists of miscellaneous notes and photocopies of secondary material about photographers compiled by Palmquist, which he then bound into volumes, as well as some boxes of biographical material, which Palmquist probably planned to have bound.</p>
                  <p>The subseries also includes photocopies of works compiled or written by others about photographers or photography studios. Many volumes include material compiled by historical archaeologist Alan Roland Woolworth during his work as a research fellow at the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
                  <p>Dates attributed to compiled materials in this subseries reflect dates of compilation rather than the dates covered by the material in the particular volume.</p>
                  <p>Each entry for a name in the subseries represents a single volume of general biographical notes compiled by Palmquist. Multiple entries for the same name represent multiple volumes on that individual or corporate body.</p>

                  <p>This subseries chiefly consists of geographical studies of photography and directories of photographers in regions throughout the United States collected by Palmquist, which he then bound into volumes.</p>
                  <p>Much of the material gathered by Palmquist supported his multi-volume dictionary of photographers working in the United States between 1840 and 1860, which he co-authored with Thomas R. Kailbourn: <title type="simple" render="italic">
                        Pioneer Photographers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary, 1840-1865

                  <p>Many volumes include material compiled by historical archaeologist Alan Roland Woolworth during his work as a research fellow at the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
                  <p>Dates attributed to compiled materials in this subseries reflect dates of compilation rather than the dates covered by the material in the particular volume.</p>
