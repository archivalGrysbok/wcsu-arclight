         <abstract id="aspace_c477690e5af6db9abfd8cf6a236063c9">The Herbert F. West Collection of A. Hugh Fisher consists of correspondence, writings, clippings, tearsheets, and fine art sent to Herbert West by the artist Alfred Hugh Fisher between 1938 and 1945. It includes over 300 letters from Fisher to West, 1938-1945; autobiographical memoirs by Fisher; volumes of travel journals (in the form of letters to his colleague Halford Mackinder) covering Fisher's work with the Visual Instruction Committee of the British Colonial Office and recording his visits to Australia, Borneo, Canada, China, Fiji, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tasmania, and Tonga, 1907-1910; various articles, clippings, notes, manuscripts, and ephemera; and a selection of drawings, paintings, and prints by Fisher whose subjects include the home of writer Margaret Leigh, and portraits of his contemporaries Lascelles Abercrombie, Walter de la Mare, T. Sturge Moore, George W. Russell, and W. B. Yeats, among others. Also present is an etching by Hungarian printmaker Gyula (Julius) Komjati, whom Fisher visited in 1932. Although West and Fisher never met in person, their long-distance friendship gave the artist someone to whom he could entrust his work and legacy, a particularly important concern when British citizens were anticipating Germany's impending attack. In addition to describing daily life in wartime Britain, Fisher's letters to West provide further personal history and context for the material West was receiving.</abstract>

         <head>Alfred Hugh Fisher (1867-1945)</head>
         <p>Alfred Hugh Fisher, a painter, printmaker, photographer, illustrator, poet, essayist, and critic known professionally as A. Hugh Fisher and to his friends as Hugh, was born in the Brixton district of London on February 8, 1867, the son of Alfred George Fisher and Isabella Read Smith Fisher. After some schooling he obtained a position as a junior clerk at George Street &amp; Company, an advertising agency, in 1884. As a youth Fisher had declared his intent to become an artist; he exhibited his first watercolor at the Royal Academy in 1887, and in the 1880s began his career as an illustrator for a variety of popular periodicals. He received formal art education through a scholarship awarded him by the National Art Training School (now the Royal College of Art) from 1894 to 1897, after which he studied for six months with Benjamin Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens at the Académie Julian in Paris. Beginning in 1901, Fisher traveled and worked in Europe and England, painting and drawing as well as turning out illustrations for publishers, particularly the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Illustrated London News
            </title>. In 1907 he was appointed to the position of artist for the British Colonial Office's Visual Instruction Committee (COVIC) under the direction of Halford Mackinder. The agency's intention was to create a series of lectures that would acquaint British children with their empire's varied geography, and Fisher was assigned to visit as many colonial possessions as he could within three years, to paint and photograph scenes to be turned into lantern slides to illustrate Mackinder's talks. His travels took him through Ceylon, India, and Burma (1907), Aden, Somaliland, Cyprus, Canada, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore (1908), Borneo, Gibraltar, Malta, and Australia (1909), and Tasmania, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji (1910). In addition, a steamship accident in 1909 allowed him to spend a few days in Japan. Aside from the thousands of images he made for the committee, Fisher's journey resulted in his own volumes <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Through India and Burmah with Pen and Brush
            </title> (1911) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               India
            </title> (1913). Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he regularly spent time in France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany. His friendship with the Hungarian etcher Gyula (Julius) Komjati (1894-1958), who was working in England in 1927, led Fisher to spend three months in Hungary and Czechoslovakia in 1932.</p>
         <p>Fisher began producing etchings in the 1890s, and was elected to membership in the Royal Society of Painters and Etchers in 1898. He was also the author of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Cathedral Church of Hereford
            </title> (1898), a few volumes of poetry, a novel titled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Quix
            </title> (1931), and many essays, obituaries, and book reviews, the latter also published under his pseudonym Caleb Reade. In 1909 Fisher married his second wife, Lilias Cecile Wyman (1875-1930), whom he had met at the offices of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Illustrated London News
            </title>. He died on July 2, 1945, after having suffered a stroke, and was buried in North Curry, Somerset, England.</p>

               <p>The series contains letters to and from A. Hugh Fisher, with some letters between Herbert West and others. Letters to Fisher appear in the first subseries and include thirty from friends who had read his 1913 book of poems. The second subseries holds the bulk of the material, more than three hundred letters written by Fisher to West between August 1938 and June 19, 1945, two weeks before he died. Also present is correspondence with two of Fisher's friends and his American print dealer, regarding the placement of West's collection of Fisher's papers.</p>
               <p>Of special interest in the letters from Fisher to West is one dated March 19, 1939, enclosing the eulogy he had delivered at the memorial service held for his wife Lilias in 1931; in the letter Fisher disclosed the story of his first marriage.</p>

               <p>Fisher had hopes that West would write his biography, and supplied him with many types of source material including his own memoirs, a mix of manuscripts, typescripts, and carbon copies. Some appear to have been written in the 1930s, but also present are the original commercial duplicate books in which Fisher recorded his COVIC observations, in the form of "diary letters" to Halford Mackinder; the volumes retain the carbon pages and, in some cases, the torn-out top sheets. Fisher's memoir of Hammersmith concentrates on his neighbors, the art critic and historian Frederic George Stephens and his family, as well as May Morris, Emery Walker, and others living nearby. Many of Fisher's letters to West (in Series I) also recount episodes of his life, so should also be consulted for biographical information. Other writings include essays, short stories, and book reviews, some of which Fisher wrote under his pseudonym of Caleb Reade.</p>
               <p>Ephemera contains catalogues and tickets from Fisher's exhibitions in Liverpool (1905) and London (1913), various promotional materials, clippings about his COVIC service (1907), and music by Jennie La Forge Cutler to Fisher's poem "Song of the Wind" (1914). A folder of photographs holds four snapshots and two formal portraits of Fisher; a large-format mounted photograph, taken while Fisher sat for his portrait to be carved in marble by means of a three-dimensional pantograph, is in Box 7.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Drawn and etched portraits include Fisher's literary friends Walter de la Mare, George W. Russell ("A.E."), and W. B. Yeats, among others, as well as the author/artist T. Sturge Moore. There are two self-portraits, two portraits of Fisher's second wife Lilias, and two of the printmaker Gyula (Julius) Komjati; many of the prints were inscribed by the artist to Herbert West. The Paintings subseries primarily contains watercolors, with one work in oil, and includes two views of the home of author Margaret Leigh. Box 9 holds two mats specially designed for the watercolors "Rocks at Low Tide" and "Wagon Shed, France" (stored in Box 8; see August 13, 1939, letter from Fisher to West). Prints also holds a series of woodcuts Fisher made to accompany Milton's "Lycidas," which were meant to be published by the Black Cat Press in Chicago; the volume was never issued. The subseries ends with one etching by Gyula Komjati. Reproductions contains photographs and photostats of Fisher's work, as well as some of his illustrations in clippings and tearsheets from publications.</p>
