         <head>Barrett Harper Clark (1890-1953)</head>
         <p>Writer, editor, and actor, Barrett Harper Clark was born on August 26, 1890 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to S. Henry and Anna M. Fralick Clark. Clark studied at the University of Chicago (1908-1912), spending two years in Paris, but did not complete his degree. While still a student Clark began teaching drama at Chautauqua, New York (1909-1917), an educational summer camp for adults. He also taught at Columbia University and Bryn Mawr (1928-1931).</p>
         <p>Following graduation Clark worked as an actor and assistant stage manager in a company run by Minnie Maddern Fiske (1912-1913). Clark then worked as a literary editor for Samuel French, a company specializing in publishing drama, in New York (1918-1936). During this period Clark also served as the dramatic editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Drama Magazine
            </title> (1924-1931) and as a member of the board of directors for the Drama League America (1915-1926). When the U.S. entered WWI Clark served as the dramatic director at Camp Humphreys, Virginia, a U.S. military training camp. In 1936 Clark left Samuel French to become the executive director of the Dramatists Play Service.</p>
         <p>In 1916 Clark married Cecile Matilda Smith, with whom he had three children: Nancy, Molly, and Barrett.</p>
         <p>Throughout his life Clark sustained a writing career. Early in his career he translated into English a number of plays by French authors: Hervieu's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Labyrinth
            </title> (1913), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Three Modern Plays from the French
            </title> (1914), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Four Plays of the Free Theater
            </title> (1914), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Four Plays of Emile Augier
            </title> (1915), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Three Plays of Donnay
            </title> (1916), Sardou's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Patrie!
            </title> (1915), Hyacinthe-Loyson's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Apostle
            </title> (1916), Curel's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               False Saint
            </title> (1916), and Brieux's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Artists' Families
            </title> (1918), among others.</p>
         <p>He wrote a number of books about drama, including: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Continental Drama of Today
            </title> (1914), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               British and American Drama of Today
            </title> (1915), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Contemporary French Dramatists
            </title> (1915), <title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title> (1925), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               An Hour of American Drama
            </title> (1930). Clark also wrote a practical manual, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               How to Produce Amateur Plays
            </title> (1917-25), which provided guidance for laypeople producing plays. In his chapbook, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Speak the Speech
            </title> (1930), Clark considers "standard English" and its impact on theatre. In <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Oedipus or Pollyanna
            </title> (1927) Clark argues against censorship, re-visiting an issue he had earlier explored in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Jurgen and the Censor
            </title> (1919). Clark published an article about Eugene O'Neill in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Sun
            </title> (May 18, 1919), and after this initial acquaintance, he went on to write a biography <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Eugene O'Neill
            </title> (1926) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Eugene O'Neill Bibliography
            </title> (with R. Sanborn) (1931). In 1928 Clark published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Professor Clark, a Memoir
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Clark also edited the fifty-eight volume <title type="simple" render="italic">
               World's Best Plays
            </title> (1915-1926) and was the first editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               America's Lost Plays
            </title> (1940-1965), a twenty volume series that brought attention to obscure plays by American dramatists from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Clark edited and co-edited a number of other works pertaining to theatre, including: Walter Prichard Eaton's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Plays and Players

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Barrett H. Clark Papers document the work of American writer, editor, and translator, Barrett H. Clark, spanning the dates 1905 to 1953. The papers contain correspondence, writings, personal papers, photographs, and printed material providing insight into Clark's scholarship on drama.</p>
         <p>Clark's intellectual circle, creative life, and work for the Samuel French company are reflected in his correspondence and writings. The Correspondence series provides insight into Clark's relationships with a number of playwrights and other authors, including Sherwood Anderson, Philip Barry, Stephen Vincent Benet, Rachel Field, Dorothy and DuBose Heyward, Sinclair Lewis, George Bernard Shaw, Upton Sinclair, Betty Smith, and Thornton Wilder. In addition, Clark's correspondence reflects his work with prominent figures in theatre, from producers and directors to actors, including Theresa Helburn, Robert Edmond Jones, Lawrence Langner, J. H. Benrimo, and William Gillette. Clark's interest in European drama is reflected in his correspondence with French and German playwrights Romain Rolland, Ernst Toller, and Fritz von Unruh. In the early 1920s Clark wrote an article about Maksim Gorki, as his correspondence with Marie Budberg, on behalf of Gorki, and related photographs illustrate.</p>
         <p>Most notably, a number of documents trace Clark's relationship with Eugene O'Neill. In addition to his correspondence with O'Neill, the papers also include letters from O'Neill's wives Agnes Boulton O'Neill and Carlotta Monterey O'Neill. The Papers also contains Clark's drafts of his biography <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Eugene O'Neill
            </title>, including proofs with corrections by O'Neill. The Printed Material series also includes documents relating to O'Neill, such as photographs, clippings, and pamphlets.</p>
         <p>The Writings series is comprised of notes and drafts documenting Clark's writing as well as the writings of others. Drafts and proofs of Clark's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Eugene O'Neill
            </title>, memoir <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Professor Clark
            </title> , and other works are included in the Writings series. A number of Clark's translations are also part of the Writings series, such as Jules Renard's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Goodbye!
            </title> and Pierre Wolff's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Unhoodwinkable
            </title>. Shorter publications by Clark are located in the Printed Material series. The Writings series also contains some correspondence relating to specific publications. In addition to Clark's writings the series also contains several works by Paul Green, Edgar Lee Masters, George Moore, and Lynn Riggs.</p>
         <p>The Printed Material series contains publications on court cases (largely pertaining to copyright and plagiarism), scrapbooks of clippings and loose clippings relating to Clark and his writings, and various authors' published plays and short stories.</p>
