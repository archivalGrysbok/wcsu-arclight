         <p>The Matthew Arnold Collection is comprised of material formerly classed as MS Vault Shelves Arnold, Uncat MS Vault Shelves Arnold, Uncat MSS 358, and Uncat MSS 834.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing, in 2012.</p>
         <p>The finding aid for this collection is largely compiled from individual catalog cards for each acquisition that were created at or around the time of receipt by the library. Information from the catalog cards was repurposed in the finding aid in accordance with current archival descriptive standards. Some catalog cards, filed with the collection, include more detailed descriptions of individual items and/or provenance notes. Descriptions for items not represented by catalog cards were derived from accession records, folder labels, or other available descriptive material. Some items are accompanied by transcripts or other explanatory material; this is not generally noted in the finding aid.</p>

         <head>Matthew Arnold (1822-1888)</head>
         <p>Matthew Arnold (1822-1888), son of British educator Thomas Arnold, was a poet and critic who began his education at Rugby School, where his father was headmaster. In 1841, he entered Balliol College, Oxford, where he began his life-long friendship with the poet Arthur Hugh Clough, graduating in 1844. In 1851, through the patronage of Lord Lansdowne, he was appointed one of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools, a position he held until his retirement in 1883. He married Frances Lucy Wightman, Lord Lansdowne's daughter, in the same year. The Arnolds had six children, only three of whom survived to adulthood.</p>
         <p>Much of Arnold's poetry was written by the time Arnold turned thirty. His major collections include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems
            </title>(1849); <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Empedocles on Etna and other Poems
            </title> (1852); <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Poems by Matthew Arnold
            </title>(1853, 1854, 1857); and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Poems
            </title> (1867). He is perhaps best known today for the elegaic<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Dover Beach
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse
            </title>. Arnold's literary and cultural criticism included the highly influential <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Culture and Anarchy
            </title> (1869) and other collections of critical essays, many of which first appeared in periodicals such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cornhill Magazine
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Athenaeum
            </title>. In addtion, he published two works on French and Continental schools.</p>
         <p>Arnold retired from the civil service in 1883 on a pension secured for him by William Gladstone. He made two extensive lecture tours of the United States, in 1883 and 1886. Matthew Arnold died of a sudden heart attack in Liverpool on April 15, 1888, and was buried three days later beside his children at Laleham.</p>
