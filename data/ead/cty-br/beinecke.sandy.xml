         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections as they are acquired, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and minimal organization, in 2013. Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, titled according to month and year of acquisition.</p>
         <p>Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

               <p>The July 2003 Acquisition consists of correspondence, writings, printed material, and other papers. The Correspondence and Subject Files consist chiefly of professional and personal letters from writers and literary organizations, documenting the literary community in which Sandy is active, and related papers. Other subject files consist of material relating to a particular person or topic (e.g. Ali Agha Shahid). Writings include drafts (autograph manuscript and typescript), proofs, and printed versions, some corrected. Other Papers include printed material and ephemera.</p>

Other Papers include photographs of Stephen Sandy at Bennington College and with his daughter.</p>
