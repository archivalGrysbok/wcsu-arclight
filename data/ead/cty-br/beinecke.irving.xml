         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>The collection was largely catalogued prior to the creation of the finding aid. At that time it was loosely organized into genres and then arranged alphabetically. Individual catalogue cards were created for each document and each document was assigned a specific call number. Printed material was catalogued separately and assigned call numbers (Za Ir 8 +G1).</p>
         <p>Former call numbers: Za Irving, Za Ir 8 +G1, Uncat Za File 519, Uncat Za File 520, Uncat Za File 521, Uncat Za File 522, and Uncat Za File 523.</p>
         <p>This collection includes materials previously identified by multiple call numbers.</p>

         <head>Washington Irving (1783-1859)</head>
         <p>Washington Irving was an American author and statesman best known for his satirical <title type="simple" render="italic">
               History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty
            </title> (1809) and short stories "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" published in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.
            </title> (1819–1820). Irving also served as Secretary to the American Legation in England from 1829 to 1832 and as Minister to Spain from 1842 to 1846.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection provides evidence of the personal and professional life of Washington Irving and dates from 1802 to 1966. The collection documents Irving's writing career, diplomatic work, and travels through Europe, and consists of correspondence, writings, personal papers, and printed material.</p>
         <p>Irving's creative process can be traced in notebooks and handwritten drafts. The collection includes notes and an autograph manuscript for volumes four and five of Irving's final book <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Life of George Washington
            </title>. The various manuscript fragments contained in the collection also illustrate the American public's fascination with Irving and the culture of collecting souvenirs related to his life and writings. For this reason the majority of Irving's drafts are incomplete; for example, the library acquired two leaves from <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus
            </title> at separate times and which are from different sections of the original manuscript. A small amount of correspondence with publishers and authors, including Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott, also reflect Irving's literary life. Irving's letter to William C. Preston expresses his views regarding the copyright of his works within an international context.</p>
         <p>A few documents relating to Irving's work as a diplomat in England and Spain are also part of the collection. These include a passport with Irving's signature in his role as Secretary to the American Legation in London. Irving's correspondence with diplomat Prince Dmitrii Ivanovich Dolgorukii and Scottish painter Sir David Wilkie reflect his experience in Spain. Notably, correspondence with Prince Dmitrii Ivanovich Dolgorukii also includes Dolgorouki's correspondence from Sir David Wilkie, in which Wilkie discusses his painting and work for King George IV of England.</p>
         <p>Irving's personal life can be traced in his correspondence with his siblings and their children (particularly his sister Catherine Rodgers Irving Paris and her daughter Sarah Sanders Paris Storrow). The collection also includes journals belonging to Emily Foster to whom Irving is believed to have proposed marriage. Documents relating to Irving's brothers -- namely John Treat and Peter -- are also included in the collection. The collection contains John Treat Irving's "Simon Pure Papers" (for which Washington Irving drew illustrations) and Peter Irving's journals describing his travels in Europe.</p>
         <p>Stanley T.Williams's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Life of Washington Irving
            </title> and extra-illustrated publications of Irving's writings attest to his reputation and lasting influence.</p>

               <p>The series documents Irving's professional life and personal relationships. The majority of correspondence is comprised of Irving's outgoing letters, although the series does include some incoming correspondence. Letters from Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Sir Walter Scott provide some insight into Irving's literary circle. Irving's correspondence to Colonel Thomas Aspinwall (who served as his literary agent for a period) and publishers also reflect his professional life.</p>
               <p>The most substantial correspondence is from Irving to various family members. Irving's correspondence with his sister Catherine Rodgers Irving Paris and his niece Sarah Sanders Paris Storrow is especially sizeable and dates from 1822 to 1858.</p>
               <p>The series also contains third-party correspondence belonging to Irving's brother Peter and nephew Pierre. Letters from Scottish painter David Wilkie to Irving and Prince Dmitrii Ivanovich Dolgorukii are notable for documenting Wilkie's career, including his experience in Spain and his work for the British royal family.</p>

               <p>The subseries Writings of Others contains the "Simon Pure Papers" by Irving's brother and for which Irving created a few illustrations. Also included is academic scholarship on Irving, namely Stanley T. Williams's biography <title type="simple" render="italic">

               <p>The Other Papers series contains notes made by Irving in both English and Spanish. The journals of Peter Irving record the travels of Washington Irving's brother through Europe in 1807. The journals of Emily Foster, dating from roughly 1820 to 1830, can also be found in Other Papers, and are notable for containing observations by Foster with whom Irving was acquainted while living in Dresden. The journals were published in 1938 by Stanley T. Williams and Leonard B. Beach.</p>
