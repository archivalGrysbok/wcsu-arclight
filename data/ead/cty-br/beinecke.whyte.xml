The largest series, Writings, includes drafts and circulating versions of dozens of works of drama and prose by Ron Whyte, including many unproduced plays. The documentation of Whyte's writings also includes material from his time as a student, spanning from high school to graduate study at the Yale School of Drama and the Union Theological Seminary. The papers also include a substantial quantity of audio recordings of dramatic works written or produced by Whyte. Other material, including subject files and unsorted papers, documents the varied and prolific career of Whyte, including his advocacy for people with disabilities.</abstract>

               <p>Series II consists chiefly of drafts of writings, most typescript, some corrected. Some files also include notes and other related material. Writings of Ron Whyte are chiefly dramatic works, but also include reviews and other works of prose. Notes and Notebooks include drafts of unidentified writings, lectures, and notes relating to various writing and editing projects. Writings of Others appear to consist of material that was sent to Ron Whyte for his review or editorial input, and versions of dramatic works produced by Ron Whyte.</p>
