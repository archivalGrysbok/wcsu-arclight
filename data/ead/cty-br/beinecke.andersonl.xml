         <p>All sound recordings in this collection are duplicates of sound recordings held by the Yale Collection of Historical Sound Recordings (HSR). As Lee Anderson made sound recordings for the Yale Series of Recorded Poets in the 1950s and 1960s, he sent the original tapes to HSR for their collection. Anderson's 1974 gift to the Beinecke Library originally included 696 sound recordings. These recordings were sent to HSR for comparison of the material held by HSR. HSR retained the originals, to complete their collection of original recordings, and duplicates were returned to the Beinecke Library. Those returned duplicates comprise this collection.</p>

         <head>Lee Anderson</head>
         <p>Lee Anderson was born in Saxton, Pennsylvania and attended the University of Pittsburgh in 1896. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War I and spent several years as a self-employed printer and farmer in western Pennsylvania. In 1942, he published his collection of poetry, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Prevailing Winds
            </title>. Anderson became interested in poetry readings and the oral aspects of poetry and began to record contemporary poets reading their work onto audiotape. At first, Anderson kept the recordings for his personal collection but soon he was asked by the Library of Congress to record and submit recorded poetry readings to the library. He submitted approximately 100 tapes to the library.</p>
         <p>In 1955, Yale University acquired Anderson's complete collection of more than 500 tapes of contemporary British and American poets reading from their work, including duplicates of recordings donated to the Library of Congress. In addition, Yale hired Anderson as a Research Associate. While at Yale, he helped produce the Yale Series of Recorded Poets, a collection of LP records of poets reading their work which was derived largely from Anderson's tape collection. Anderson made additional recordings of poets reading while he was at Yale. In addition to producing recordings, Anderson edited several books in his lifetime.</p>
         <p>After leaving Yale, Anderson taught at several institutions and continued to write and lecture. He continued recording but primarily recorded his work. In the late 1960's Anderson became ill. He died in Florida in 1972.</p>

         <p>The Lee Anderson Papers and Yale Series of Recorded Poets Sound Recordings document the work of poet and editor Lee Anderson in recording contemporary poets reading from their work and later producing the Yale Series of Recorded Poets. The bulk of the sound recordings consist of poetry readings by various poets and a small number of poets' lectures on poetry. The papers consist of writings, correspondence, contracts, lists, procedural documentation, and printed material relating to the series production and publication. Included among the papers is Lee Anderson's notebook draft of "Memoirs," containing observations of poets reading for the Yale Series of Record Poets. The sound recordings and papers span the years 1951 to 1968.</p>
