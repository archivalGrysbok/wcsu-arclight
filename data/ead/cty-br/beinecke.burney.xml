         <head>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES</head>
         <p>Edward Francis Burney, a cousin of Fanny Burney, was born in Worcester in 1760. In 1776 he moved to London, where he studied at the Royal Academy Schools and gained the friendship of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1780-1803. In 1784 he designed large illustrations for Dr. Charles Burney's volume for the Handel commemoration at Westminster Abbey. Burney is known for his large satirical watercolors and caricatures. For the last forty years of his life, he worked almost exclusively as a book illustrator, illustrating the works of such poets as Langhorne and Young. E. F. Burney died in London in 1848.</p>
         <p>James Pattison Cockburn was born in 1778. He was a pupil of P. Sandby's at Woolich, which he entered in 1793 and left in 1795 to serve at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope. After the peace of 1815 he was stationed for a time at Malta, and made a number of visits to Italy and Switzerland. He wrote and illustrated several books about his travels, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Route of the Simplon
            </title> (1822) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Valley of the Austa
            </title> (1823). He also visited Canada. He was Director of the Royal Laboratory, Woolich, from 1838 to 1846, and died at Woolich in 1849.</p>
         <p>Sir Richard Colt Hoare was born in 1758. Between 1785 and 1791 he traveled on the Continent, filling a portfolio with drawings of interesting sights and objects, toured Monmouthshire with Archdeacon Coxe, and contributed sixty-three drawings to his friend's description of that county. Hoare was a member of the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. He was particularly interested in the history and antiquities of his own county, and wrote and illustrated a variety of works on Wiltshire. His <title type="simple" render="italic">
               History of Modern Wiltshire
            </title> was left unfinished when he died at Stourhead in 1838.</p>
         <p>Edward Lear was born in London in 1812. In 1831 he was employed by the Zoological Society, assisting several scholars in their ornithological drawings. From 1832 to 1836 he was engaged at Knowsley, the residence of the Earl of Derby, and drew the plates to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Knowsley Menagerie
            </title>. Lear invented his <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Book of Nonsense
            </title> for his patron's grandchildren. Beginning in 1836 he devoted himself to landscape, and in 1837 he left England, returning only for brief visits. He was a drawing master in Rome for several years. He also traveled in Southern Europe, Palestine, and India, and published several illustrated journeys of his tours. He began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1850. Edward Lear spent the last few years of his life in San Remo, where he died in January 1888.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Burney-Lear Drawings consists of over 1,000 watercolors, sketches, and drawings by Edward Francis Burney, other members of the Burney family, members of the Hoare family, Edward Lear, and others. Most of the drawings are unsigned, and some of the attributions are still uncertain. The majority of the material appears to date from the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
         <p>The collection originally consisted of eight bound albums and three portfolios of unbound drawings. Both albums and portfolios carry numbers assigned to them by Charles J. Sawyer before the sale of the collection to Louis W. Hill, Sr. Sawyer's numbering sequence has been retained, but the unbound drawings have been removed from the three portfolios and placed in one box and six oversize containers. Individual unbound drawings have been given numbers, as have the leaves of the bound albums.</p>
         <p>The largest group of drawings in the collection is related to the Burney family. About 200 drawings by Edward Francis Burney, the watercolorist and book illustrator, can be found in Albums 4 and 5a. These include designs for illustrations and studies for larger works. Album 5a also contains works by other members of the E. F. Burney family, including his brother, Thomas Frederick Burney, and his sister, Elizabeth Warren Burney. Albums 1, 5b, and 8 house additional drawings attributed to various members of the Burney family. Landscapes predominate, but there are also several Burney family portraits.</p>
         <p>Albums 6 and 7 are almost certainly associated with the family of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, and Albums 2 and 3 may be also. These albums contain much amateur work, although there are some interesting views. The watercolors in Albums 2 and 3 may be by the same hand, and it has been suggested that their style recalls that of Samuel Prout or of George Barret the younger.</p>
         <p>The last three albums contain work by unrelated artists. There are approximately forty-five landscape sketches by Edward Lear in Album 11. Many of these are identified, annotated, and dated views of Mediterranean scenes. Album 9 houses sepia-wash landscapes attributed to Major-General James Pattison Cockburn. Finally, Album 10 is the sketchbook of an unidentified amateur.</p>
         <p>Album 12, the 1986 gift of Louis W. Hill, Jr., contains 127 watercolor sketches and drawings, many attributed to Edward Lear.</p>
         <p>The Burney-Lear Drawings are of considerable interest to students of Edward Lear, Edward Francis Burney, and the Burney family in general. Several of the views, such as the scenes of Brighton in Album 1, have some historical value. In addition, the many amateur landscapes provide excellent documentation of the development of the picturesque in England.</p>
