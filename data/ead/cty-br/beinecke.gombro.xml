         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Witold Gombrowicz Archive documents Gombrowicz's life and literary output chiefly during the last two decades of his life (1949-69), as well as the reception of his works after his death. Due to his unexpected exile from Poland following the onset of World War II, and the difficulties he faced during his first few years in Argentina, the collection contains relatively little material from the time of his birth in 1904 through 1949.</p>
         <p>The archive consists of Witold Gombrowicz's personal papers, material that was in his possession at the time of his death, and material later added by his wife Rita Gombrowicz. Gombrowicz's personal papers include correspondence, manuscripts of his writings, writings of others, newspaper clippings (some of which Gombrowicz annotated), photo albums, and personal papers. Rita Gombrowicz supplemented these materials with copies of Gombrowicz's outgoing correspondence, other documentation of his life, including his family background, and some literary manuscripts and related material. Other materials principally contributed by Rita Gombrowicz include theater programs relating to productions of Gombrowicz's works and to the Polish theater more generally, posters, audio recordings and video tapes, typescripts of adaptations of Gombrowicz's works by others, photographs documenting productions of his works, writings by others about Gombrowicz, additional clippings files, commemorative material, and Gombrowicz-related printed ephemera. The archive also includes Rita Gombrowicz's papers relating to her research on her husband and to her management of his literary affairs following his death.</p>
         <p>Much of the archive is in Polish. To aid researchers, the spelling of Polish words and proper names has been simplified and diacritic symbols have been omitted. In the latter case, the Polish characters "l with stroke" or "a with ogonek" are treated respectively as "l" and "a" in the alphabetical listing. A noteworthy feature of the archive is, however, the extraordinary range of languages represented in the material, reflecting the breadth of Gombrowicz's influence. In addition to Polish, the languages most heavily represented are French, Spanish, German, and English. The archive includes material written in Bosnian, Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Swedish, Turkish, and Yiddish.</p>
         <p>The archive is housed in 137 boxes and organized into twelve series: Correspondence, Writings of Gombrowicz, Adaptations by Others of Gombrowicz's Works, Theatre Programs, Writings by Others About Gombrowicz, Commemorative Works and Activities, Audiovisual Materials, Photographs, Personal Papers, Rita Gombrowicz Papers, Clippings, and Posters.</p>

                  Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, encompasses personal (including family) and literary and business correspondence, as well as fan mail, arranged in a single alphabetical run by name of correspondent. Incoming and outgoing correspondence is interfiled.</p>
         <p>A significant portion of the correspondence includes originals of incoming letters and carbons of outgoing letters. The correspondence also includes photocopies and transcripts, added by Rita Gombrowicz, of original letters held in private hands or in public institutions (chiefly the Muzeum Literatury im. Adama Mickiewicza w Warszawie). Rita Gombrowicz's processing notes, which contextualize the contents of folders, have also been retained. Other notes, for example those which refer to more than one correspondent, and background material, such as brochures and photocopied fragments of books of a more general nature, have been moved to Series X, Rita Gombrowicz Papers, Research Files. Many of the correspondence folders include translations of letters, some of which were made during Gombrowicz's lifetime and for his use (chiefly translations from English and German). Others are the result of Rita Gombrowicz's research (chiefly translations from Polish and Spanish).</p>
         <p>Gombrowicz's personal correspondents include several members of his family. Of particular note is the correspondence of his brother Janusz Gombrowicz, which dates from 1948-67 and is continued, after Janusz's death, by his stepdaughter Stanislawa Cichowska. Other relatives among Gombrowicz's correspondents include Janusz Gombrowicz's wife Franciszka Gombrowicz, his sister Irena Gombrowicz, his brother Jerzy Gombrowicz, his nephew Józef Gombrowicz, his niece Teresa Gombrowicz, and his cousins Gustaw Kotkowski and Teresa Soltan. Correspondence between the writer and his siblings, Irena Gombrowicz and Jerzy Gombrowicz, can also be found on microfilm in Series IX, Personal Papers.</p>
         <p>Many of Gombrowicz's friendships were of a personal and literary character. Perhaps the best example of this was his friendship with Constantin Jelenski. Their collaboration is documented by correspondence spanning the years 1956-69. These files then continue with correspondence between Jelenski and Rita Gombrowicz. This correspondence, most of which has been published, shows the important role Jelenski played in promoting Gombrowicz's literary career.</p>
         <p>Other significant correspondents from Polish literary and cultural circles are the writers Tadeusz Breza, Zofia Chadzynska, Alexandra Orme (Litka de Barcza), Józef Czapski, Maria Dabrowska, Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz, Maria Szczepanska Kuncewiczowa, Czeslaw Milosz, Stanislaw Mrozek, Leopold Tyrmand, Kaimierz Wierzynski, Józef Wittlin, and Pawel Zdziechowski. Also represented are the painters Alicja Giangrande and Zygmunt Grocholski, the literary critic Artur Sandauer, the composer Zygmunt Mycielski, theater director Tadeusz Kantor, and the editor Jerzy Giedroyc.</p>
         <p>Several of Gombrowicz's Polish emigré friends also are represented, including Maria Swieczewska and Karol Swieczewski. The Swieczewskis' correspondence (mostly photocopies) addresses a wide variety of topics, ranging from financial affairs to literary and personal concerns. Other Polish emigrés included in the series are Halina and Krzysztof Grodzicki, Rena Dzianott, and Ada Lubomirska. An extensive file of correspondence with Maria Paczowska and Bohdan Paczowski includes an interesting letter dictated by Gombrowicz to Rita and written in phonetic Polish. The bulk of this correspondence is written in Polish, with occasional letters in French.</p>
         <p>Extensive files also exist for Witold Gombrowicz's Argentinian friends, Mariano Betelú, Juan Carlos Gomez, Jorge di Paola, and Miguel Grinberg. Files for Alejandro Rússovich, Sergio Rússovich, Beduino, Juan Carlos Ferreyra, and Enrique Wendt contain somewhat less correspondence. Witold Gombrowicz's wider contacts with Latin American literary and cultural circles are documented by correspondence with Virgilio Piñera, Roger Plá, Ernesto Sabato, Humberto Rodriguez Tomeu, Sergio Pitol, and Manuel Puig. All of the Latin American correspondence is in Spanish.</p>
         <p>In addition to Gombrowicz's Polish and Latin American correspondents, the archive contains correspondence with many other outstanding personalities of the literary and art world of the mid-20th century. This group of letters, written chiefly in French, includes correspondence with Ingmar Bergman, François Bondy, Martin Buber, Albert Camus, Jean Dubuffet, Jean-Claude Hémery, Ernst Kreuder, Jorge Lavelli, and Alf Sjöberg. The series also contains a draft of a letter written by Gombrowicz to the French president Charles de Gaulles, and the replies on behalf of the president.</p>
         <p>Gombrowicz's correspondence with editors, and his relationships with publishing houses, is also well represented. As a result, these files provide a rich source for the study of Gombrowicz's literary career and publication history. Extensive correspondence files exist between Gombrowicz and Jerzy Giedroyc, the Polish editor of Gombrowicz's works and publisher of the Paris-based Polish monthly <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Kultura
            </title>. Most of the letters in these files are originals; problems with precise dating of the letters (no year date on the items) resulted in their being grouped by decade (1950s, 1960s), based on the letterhead or other annotations.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the correspondence regarding French editions, including matters related to translations, can be found in the following files: Gallimard, Belfond, Denoël, Julliard, Lettres Nouvelles, Koukou Chanska, Geneviève Serreau, Maurice Nadeau, and Dominique de Roux. The rather complex history surrounding the publication of Witold Gombrowicz's works in French is explained in notes by Rita Gombrowicz (Series X, Rita Gombrowicz Papers, Research Files) and in her book <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Gombrowicz in Europe
            </title>.</p>
         <p>For Gombrowicz's German publishers, extensive documentation exists for Neske, S. Fischer Verlag, and R. Piper &amp; Co. There are also files for Rowohlt, C. Bertelsmann Verlag, and Insel Verlag. Correspondence with Gombrowicz's German translator Walter Tiel is filed under Rudolf Richter (Tiel's real name).</p>
         <p>English language editors are represented by several American publishers, including Grove Press, Harcourt Brace, Atlantic Monthly Press, Alfred Knopf, Viking Press, Harper and Row, Fawcett Publications Inc., Simon and Schuster, and Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company. British publishers represented include Calder and Boyars Ltd. and Macgibbon &amp; Kee.</p>
         <p>Considerable files also exist for publishers in Argentina, Spain, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Mexico, and Scandinavia, and for a few institutions, Radio Free Europe, the Ford Foundation, and Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst.</p>
         <p>Gombrowicz's published correspondence (magazine publications and limited book editions) forms a subseries of Series V, Writings by Others About Gombrowicz. Photocopies of letters to Gombrowicz are included in the subseries <title type="simple" render="italic">
