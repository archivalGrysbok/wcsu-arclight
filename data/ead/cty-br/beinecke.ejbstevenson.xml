         <p>The Edwin J. Beinecke Collection of Robert Louis Stevenson was first processed in the 1950s, during which time George Leslie McKay, curator and librarian at the Grolier Club (1924-1959), compiled a six volume <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Stevenson Library Catalogue
            </title> in collaboration with Yale University Library staff and faculty. While the McKay <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catalogue
            </title> documents the three largest components of the collection, the printed materials, correspondence, and manuscripts, it does not account for: artwork, photographs, memorabilia, and other materials acquired with the principal gifts of the early to mid 1950s; additional gifts and purchases made by Edwin J. Beinecke for the collection until his death in 1970; or Edwin J. Beinecke's research files. The manuscript collection was reprocessed in 2009 in order to consolidate the various parts of the collection and to represent the collection through a single online guide. The arrangement documented in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catalogue
            </title> has essentially been preserved. Printed materials described in volumes one, two, and six of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catalogue
            </title> form part of the Beinecke Library's printed collections and, with a few exceptions (503-505, 2576, and 7701), are not reflected in this guide. A significant number of books in the collection have been cataloged and can be found by searching the library's online catalog (Orbis). Other printed materials, such as journal articles and ephemera, have not been cataloged and can be found by paging material by McKay number. During reprocessing, materials acquired by the library (474, 2622, 6062 and 7580) through sources other than Edwin J. Beinecke were removed to the Robert Louis Stevenson Collection (GEN MSS 684).</p>
         <p>This collection includes material formerly classed as Ms Vault Stevenson, Ms Vault Stevenson "Supplemental", Uncat Ms Vault File Stevenson, and Uncat Ms Vault 805.</p>

         <head>Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894)</head>
         <p>Robert Louis Stevenson was one of the most popular and prolific British writers of the late 19th century, the author of verse, novels, travel books, short stories, plays, and essays, including such titles as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Treasure Island
            </title>. There is considerable secondary literature on Stevenson, including book-length biographical studies, chronologies, and bibliographies. Summary information is available in the standard print and online biographical resources.</p>

      <scopecontent id="aspace_1cb5316c261b32bcae182bace3bb379f">
         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Edwin J. Beinecke Collection of Robert Louis Stevenson, formed by Beinecke Library benefactor Edwin J. Beinecke, comprises the largest group of material by, about, and relating to author Robert Louis Stevenson in the world. In addition to Edwin J. Beinecke's research files, the collection contains correspondence, writings, documents, photographs, artwork, memorabilia, scrapbooks, and personal papers dating from 1828 to 1970, with the bulk of the collection dating from the 1870s through 1940s, and Stevenson's correspondence and writings dating from the 1870s to his death in 1894.</p>
         <p>As George Leslie McKay notes in his preface to volume three of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Stevenson Library: Catalogue
            </title>, Stevenson's "wanderings about the face of the earth" and "distances of thousands of miles" from friends and family, resulted in voluminous correspondence. The collection contains approximately 3,300 pieces of correspondence altogether, with 1,000 letters by Stevenson and 300 letters by his wife Fanny Van de Grift. The largest groups of Stevenson correspondence can be found for his parents, Thomas and Margaret Isabella Stevenson, editor Edward L. Burlingame, and friends Charles Baxter and Sidney Colvin. Other noteworthy correspondents include Stevenson's cousin Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson, his stepchildren Lloyd Osbourne and Isobel Field, collaborator William Ernest Henley, authors J. M. Barrie, Henry James, Andrew Lang, and Charles Warren Stoddard, the publisher Charles Scribner, and artists who made representations of Stevenson during the last decade of his life, Will Hicok Low, Auguste Rodin, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and John Singer Sargent. Given Stevenson's wanderings and distances from correspondents, not surprisingly, according to McKay, many Stevenson letters document "his health... what he ate and drank, the people he met... [his] states of mind, [and] the books he read and... wrote."</p>
         <p>Series II. Manuscripts by Robert Louis Stevenson consists of writings and other materials, such as notes and lists, in Stevenson's hand. The collection contains drafts of "more than half the poems" to several collections of poetry, including both <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Underwoods
            </title> (1887) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Songs of Travel and Other Verses
            </title> (1896), and complete or partial drafts to several prose works, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catriona
            </title> (1893), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Ebb-Tide
            </title>(1894), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               In the South Seas
            </title> (1896) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               St. Ives
            </title> (1897). There are also portions to the last three chapters of Stevenson's popular <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
            </title> (1886).</p>
         <p>Series III. Addition and Other Materials consists almost entirely of Stevenson related materials not documented in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catalogue
            </title>. This includes the photographs, artwork, and memorabilia that came to the library in the early 1950s with the principal gifts of Edwin J. Beinecke's collection, as well as smaller gifts and purchases made through the 1960s. There are original photographs of Stevenson, family, and friends, many Stevenson homes and residences, and the areas in which he lived and travelled, as well as albums containing material relating chiefly to Stevenson's life in Samoa. Artistic representations of Stevenson include work by well-known artists working at the turn of the 20th century. Works include: oil and watercolor portraits by Girolamo Nerli and Percy F. S. Spence respectively; charcoal portraits by Nerli and John Singer Sargent; busts and reliefs by Gutzon Borglum, Allen Hutchinson, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens; and engravings, etchings, and woodcut and linoleum prints by Robert Bryden, Timothy Cole, Samuel Hollyer, Thomas Johnson, Joseph Simpson, and Samuel Johnson Woolf. In addition, there are original drawings and watercolors for book illustrations by Robert Browne, William Hole, George Varian, and R. Canton Woodville, as well as original drawings by James Renwick Brevoort and Erastus Salisbury Field.</p>
         <p>Edwin J. Beinecke's research files contain correspondence and documents relating to his acquisition of Stevenson material. Volumes feature correspondence between Edwin J. Beinecke and his assistant, Gertrude Hills, and others, including book and manuscript dealers, publishers, libraries, and Stevenson scholars. Correspondents include Clayton Hamilton, Sanki Ichikawa, Archibald MacLeish, Vincent Starrett, and descendants of Stevenson's family and friends.</p>

               <p>Series I. Correspondence is organized into four subseries: Letters by Robert Louis Stevenson, Letters by Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson, Letters to and about Robert Louis Stevenson, and Transcriptions.</p>

               <p>The arrangement of the first three correspondence subseries largely preserves the arrangement documented in volumes three and four of George Leslie McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     A Stevenson Library Catalogue
                  </title>. Letters described in volume six, the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Addenda &amp; Corrigenda
                  </title>, have been moved and interfiled in the appropriate Series I subseries. Letters are arranged alphabetically within each subseries. McKay numbers follow each name or folder heading in parentheses. The first heading, for example, is for Allen, Grant (2629).</p>
               <p>As McKay notes in the preface to volume three of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title> (1956), Stevenson's "wanderings about the face of the earth" and "distances of thousands of miles" from friends and family, resulted in voluminous correspondence. The series contains approximately 3,300 pieces of correspondence altogether and 1,000 letters by Stevenson himself. The largest groups of correspondence can be found for Stevenson's parents, Thomas and Margaret Isabella, editor Edward L. Burlingame, and friends Charles Baxter and Sidney Colvin. The series includes a significant number of letters, approximately 300, from Stevenson's wife Fanny. Other noteworthy correspondents include Stevenson's cousin Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson, his stepchildren Lloyd Osbourne and Isobel Field, collaborator William Ernest Henley, and authors J. M. Barrie, Henry James, Andrew Lang, and Charles Warren Stoddard.</p>
               <p>Many of Robert Louis Stevenson's outgoing letters bear marks, including dates, McKay numbers, and other numeric codes. Letters are also often accompanied by copies (fascimiles and photostats), transcriptions, printed vendor descriptions and materials, notes, and provenance tracings, such as bookplates and stamps. Some letters are bound with other material. In such cases, the volume is usually filed by the lowest McKay number. References are provided where appropriate.</p>
               <p>Letters by Stevenson often provide only a partial form of the recipient's name. The full forms of names listed below are based first on the established name headings in the Library of Congress Name Authority file and, when not found in the name authority file, on the headings in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title>. Some letters are identified in McKay as having been dictated to or drafted by others. This information has not been preserved in the folder list below. Letters lacking dates, for which dates have been supplied in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title> and/or penciled onto letters, are bracketed (e.g. [1887]).</p>
               <p>Many letters attributed to Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson can be found in the Letters by Robert Louis Stevenson subseries. References are provided where appropriate.</p>
               <p>The Letters to and about Robert Louis Stevenson subseries combines incoming and third party correspondence. In addition to letters by the family, friends, and authors already noted among the outgoing correspondents, there are letters here by publishers, which shed light on the publishing of Stevenson's writings, and artists, including Will Hicok Low, Auguste Rodin, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and John Singer Sargent. In order to distinguish the incoming and third party correspondence, the names of recipients have been listed in folder notes.</p>
               <p>The Transcriptions subseries consists of typescript transcriptions of selected original letters from the first three correspondence subseries. The transcriptions were made in 1953 at the request of Edwin J. Beinecke.</p>
               <p>A small amount of correspondence by Robert Louis Stevenson and Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson not documented in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title> can be found in Series III. Additions and Other Material. Correspondence about Stevenson can also be found in Series III, and correspondence relating to Edwin J. Beinecke's research into and acquisition of Stevenson material can be found in Series IV.</p>

                     Addenda &amp; Corrigenda
                  </title>, have also been interfiled in the appropriate Series II subseries. Folder headings listed here are intended to aid in discovery and retrieval; they do not duplicate the richer description, including physical characteristics and publication information, provided in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title>. McKay numbers follow each title.</p>
               <p>Manuscripts by Robert Louis Stevenson consists of writings and other materials, such as notes and lists, in Stevenson's hand. The collection contains drafts of "more than half the poems" to several collections of poetry, including both <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Underwoods
                  </title> (1887) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Songs of Travel and Other Verses
                  </title> (1896), and complete or partial drafts to several prose works, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catriona
                  </title> (1893), <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Ebb-Tide
                  </title>(1894), <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     In the South Seas
                  </title> (1896) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     St. Ives
                  </title> (1897). There are also portions of the last three chapters of Stevenson's famous <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
                  </title> (1886).</p>
               <p>According to McKay, and evident from the drafts themselves, "it was Stevenson's habit... to write poems, and to some extent prose pieces, in notebooks." In earlier processing of the collection, reflected in the description in volume five of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title>, all titles (or items) were arranged and listed in a single alphabetical run. In reprocessing, however, and in this guide to the collection, notebooks and works containing multiple titles have been treated as units. The notebooks are now arranged by number (e.g. "51") or title (e.g. "RLS/C") under the supplied heading [Notebooks]; it is not clear whether the notebook headings are in the hand of Robert Louis Stevenson or someone else. As a rule, titles within notebooks are not listed in the general run of manuscripts as they are in McKay. Please note that this results in apparent gaps in the sequence of McKay numbers. For example, the first title, "In Abererch" (5929) is followed by ["About the world with bag on back..."] (5933). The intervening titles/numbers (5930-5932) can be found in notebooks and works; titles can be searched within the finding aid by keyword or McKay number. In some cases, for example, where there are multiple drafts for a particular title, there are references to the notebooks.</p>
               <p>A few notebooks have been reassembled on the basis of physical evidence and recommendations by Stevenson scholars, most notably Roger Swearingen, though many manuscripts also contain notes by George S. Hellman.</p>
               <p>Works or groups of material with a common heading are filed under the title of the work and, as with notebooks, individual items are listed in a folder note. References are provided from the general run of titles only when the location is not clear from the description in McKay.</p>
               <p>In this collection, a significant number of manuscript items are bound with others. In these cases, references to physical locations are provided in folder notes. The arrangement of loose manuscript items, such as drafts of different poems on the recto and verso of a single sheet, has been preserved and, here too, references to physical locations are provided in folder notes.</p>
               <p>Volume five of McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title> also describes manuscripts found in correspondence and printed materials. References to manuscripts located in Series I. Correspondence are provided in the list below. References to presentation inscriptions in printed materials, however, have not been preserved in this guide; manuscript notes and inscriptions are commonly documented in the catalog records in Orbis.</p>
               <p>Manuscripts by Others consists of writings by family members, writings by others about Stevenson, and documents relating to Stevenson. Writings by family members features the diaries of Margaret Isabella Stevenson, in forty-seven volumes dating from 1853 to 1897, and various works, as well as notebooks, by Thomas Stevenson. Writings by others consists chiefly of reflections on Stevenson and his work. Documents include legal and financial records, such as wills, conveyances, and royalty statements.</p>

               <p>Series III consists almost entirely of Stevenson related materials not documented in McKay's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     A Stevenson Library: Catalogue
                  </title>. This includes the photographs, artwork, and memorabilia that came to the library in the early 1950s with the principal gifts of Edwin J. Beinecke's collection, as well as smaller gifts and purchases made through the 1960s--Mr. Beinecke supported the collection until his death in 1970. In the first case, materials appear to have been omitted from the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue
                  </title>; some items are even accompanied by notes, "Not Cataloged" or "No RLS Interest," made, presumably, by McKay in the course of cataloging. In the latter case, some acquisitions post-date the compilation of the final volume of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Catalogue

               <p>During processing some materials previously classified as MS Vault Stevenson "Supplemental" were traced to sources other than Mr. Beinecke. These materials were removed to the Robert Louis Stevenson Collection (GEN MSS ?).</p>
               <p>Correspondence contains letters to and from Stevenson, including transcriptions of letters from J. M. Barrie, William Ernest Henley, Will Hicok Low, and others. Purchases are often accompanied by vendor correspondence and/or descriptions. O ther corrrespondence consists of third-party letters between family, friends, and others also represented in Series I. Correspondence.</p>
               <p>Writings consists of a small number of works by Stevenson and others, chiefly printed versions.</p>
               <p>The series features original photographs and artwork relating to Stevenson. Photographs and Graphic Material includes photographic prints and printed reproductions, including postcards and clippings. Materials are subdivided for images of People, Robert Louis Stevenson in Artwork, Places, and Other. There are photographs of Stevenson, family, and friends, many Stevenson homes and residences, and the areas in which he lived and travelled, as well as albums containing material relating chiefly to Stevenson's life in Samoa. Additional photographs and printed reproductions can be found in the scrapbooks.</p>
               <p>Artistic representations of Stevenson include work by well-known artists working around the turn of the 20th century. Works include: oil and watercolor portraits by Girolamo Nerli and Percy F. S. Spence respectively; charcoal portraits by Nerli and John Singer Sargent; busts and reliefs by Gutzon Borglum, Allen Hutchinson, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens; and engravings, etchings, and woodcut and linoleum prints by artists Robert Bryden, Timothy Cole, Samuel Hollyer, Thomas Johnson, Joseph Simpson, and Samuel Johnson Woolf. In addition, there are numerous original drawings and watercolors for book illustrations by Robert Browne, William Hole, George Varian, and R. Canton Woodville, as well as original drawings by James Renwick Brevoort and Erastus Salisbury Field.</p>
               <p>Memorabilia consists of numerous objects, such as Stevenson's chess set and pipe, and Other Materials features scrapbooks containing clippings, printed ephemera, and original artwork and photographs.</p>

               <p>Series IV. Research Files contains correspondence and documents relating to Edwin J. Beinecke's research into and acquisition of Robert Louis Stevenson material. The bulk of the material appears originally to have been housed in several numbered volumes. Volumes I-II and V-VI feature correspondence between Edwin J. Beinecke, his assistant Gertrude Hills, and others, including book and manuscript dealers, publishers, libraries, and Stevenson scholars. Correspondents include Clayton Hamilton, Sanki Ichikawa, Archibald MacLeish, Vincent Starrett, and descendants of Stevenson's family and friends. Correspondence in volumes I-II and V-VI is subdivided for General Correspondence, dating from the early 1930s into the early 1940s, and Other Correspondence, with letters arranged alphabetically within each subseries. Volume II also contains third party correspondence between George S. Hellman and others. Documents are preserved in the order given by previous processing.</p>
               <p>Volumes III and IV feature third party correspondence and are arranged into subseries for Letters to Sidney Colvin, Letters to George S. Hellman, and Other Correspondence. Correspondence to the art historian and literary biographer Sidney Colvin, also editor of Stevenson's letters, includes original letters and transcriptions from authors and critics such as J. M. Barrie, Edmund Gosse, Georges Grappe, Clayton Hamilton, and Auguste Rodin, as well as publishers. Most letters to George S. Hellman relate to his 1925 biography of Stevenson. Other Correspondence includes letters from members of the Osbourne and Stevenson families.</p>
               <p>Among the documents in Volume V is a booklet on "The Edwin J. Beinecke Collection of Robert Louis Stevenson" (1939) by Gertrude Hills. Hills' text highlights material in the Beinecke collection before it was donated to the Yale University Library in the early 1950s.</p>
               <p>In addition to the volumes, Other Materials, arranged by material type, include bibiographical notes, catalogs and lists of Stevenson material, financial records, photographs, and scrapbooks.</p>
