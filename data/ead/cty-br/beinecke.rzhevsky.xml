The papers span the years 1941-1987, with the bulk of the material dating from the 1950s and 1960s. The papers include material related to a few of Rzhevsky's works of fiction but chiefly document his critical essays, lectures and editorial work.<lb/>Correspondence and writings document Rzhevsky's role in the twentieth-century Russian emigre literary community in Europe and the United States. Rzhevsky was critical of the Soviet government and advocated for a unified emigre voice to propel Russian literary analysis into the post-Soviet era. Correspondence provides personal insights that are crucial to contextualizing Rzhevsky's creative writing, since his style of fiction approaches that of a memoir when addressing the fate of Soviet refugees (especially in post-War Germany).</abstract>

         <p>Partially processed in 1998. Processing completed and finding aid revised in 2008.</p>
         <p>The Library of Congress system is used to transliterate Russian language, but diacritics are not used. Illustrative examples are: Iuz Aleshkovskii and Efim Etkind. Names of Russian emigres are spelled in accordance with the individual's usage or record of publication. Therefore these spellings do not necessarily conform to standard Library of Congress transliteration. For example, the spelling Rzhevsky is used throughout the finding aid (instead of Rzhevskii).</p>

         <head>Leonid Denisovich Rzhevsky (1905-1986)</head>
         <p>Leonid Denisovich Rzhevsky was born with the family name Surazhevskii on August 21, 1905 in Moscow. He graduated from Moscow Second University in 1930 and completed his graduate training at the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in 1941 with the rank of <emph render="italic">Kandidat</emph>. In 1953 he emigrated from the Soviet Union, teaching for several years at the University of Lund in Sweden before moving permanently to the United States in 1963. He taught on the faculty of the University of Oklahoma, Norman (1963-1964), New York University (1964-1974) and the Norwich University Russian School summer program (1968-1980s).</p>
         <p>Rzhevsky published numerous novels, stories, and critical essays beginning in the 1950s. He was active in the anti-communist Russian emigre community and had long-standing associations with the journals <title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title> (and the affiliated publishing house) and <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <p>Rzhevsky's major works of fiction include the novels <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mezhdu dvukh zvezd
            </title>(1953), <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <p>The Leonid Rzhevsky Papers consist of correspondence, writings, clippings and personal papers that document the work of Russian-born novelist and literary critic Leonid Rzhevsky. The papers span the years 1941-1987, with the bulk of the material dating from the 1950s and 1960s. The papers include material related to a few of Rzhevsky's works of fiction but chiefly document his critical essays, lectures and editorial work.</p>
         <p>Correspondence and writings document Rzhevsky's role in the twentieth-century Russian emigre literary community in Europe and the United States. Rzhevsky was critical of the Soviet government and advocated for a unified emigre voice to propel Russian literary analysis into the post-Soviet era. Correspondence provides personal insights that are crucial to contextualizing Rzhevsky's creative writing, since his style of fiction approaches that of a memoir when addressing the fate of Soviet refugees (especially in post-War Germany).</p>
         <p>Rzhevsky's editorial work is documented in his correspondence with "second wave" emigre literary figures, many of whom fled to Europe and the United States via Germany in the wake of the Second World War. Much of the correspondence is addressed to Rzhevsky both in a personal capacity and in his capacity as editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Grani
            </title> from 1952 to 1955 and of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Novyi Zhurnal
            </title>from 1975 to 1976. Correspondents such as Igor Chinnov, Ivan Elagin and Boris Filippov proposed essays for publication and discussed writings of Rzhevsky and others. In many cases, correspondence that began on formal editorial terms continued after Rzhevsky's tenure as editor.</p>
         <p>The papers include dozens of drafts and printed versions of Rzhevsky's essays and lectures. His writings and lectures address diverse topics in Russian literature, including stylistics in the work of Solzhenitsyn, spiritual themes in the work of Dostoevsky, and innovations in the language of contemporary Soviet poets.</p>
         <p>The papers also include fragmentary documentation of Rzhevsky's teaching, including correspondence with students and the schedules of symposia he organized at Norwich University in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

               <p>Correspondence documents Rzhevsky's role as editor and writer of literary fiction and criticism within the Russian emigre communities in Europe and the United States. A large part of the correspondence, especially that in the 1950s, relates to Rzhevsky's editorial work for the journal <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Grani
                  </title>. Later correspondence also relates to conferences and lectures that Rzhevsky organized or attended and includes letters from students.

               <p>Series II is organized into five subseries: Longer Works, Essays and Other Shorter Works, Lectures, Radio Scripts, and Writings of Others.

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Writings and Lectures consist of drafts and printed versions of essays, lectures, and radio scripts, and material relating to a few longer works (a playscript, Rzhevsky's dissertation and an edited volume of the correspondence of Kornei Chukovskii). The material chiefly documents Rzhevsky's literary analysis and there is little representation of Rzhevsky's many works of fiction.</p>
               <p>The subjects of Rzhevsky's literary analysis are diverse within the scope of Russian-language literature, ranging from Aleksandr Pushkin to Bella Akhmadulina. In his essays and lectures, Rzhevsky employed stylistic and lexical analysis to discuss creativity and the relationship of literature to society. He also addressed the importance of emigration in defining twentieth-century Russian-language literature.</p>
               <p>Some essays are written under the pseudonym L. Tann.</p>
               <p>Writings of Others consists of drafts of two essays in German by Maria de Smeth.</p>
