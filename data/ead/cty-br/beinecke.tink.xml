         <head>CHAUNCEY BREWSTER TINKER, 1876-1963</head>
         <p>Chauncey Brewster Tinker was born on October 22, 1876 in Auburn, Maine, the son of Rev. Anson Phelps Tinker, Yale class of 1868, and Martha Jane White Tinker. After losing his mother at age three and his father at age twelve, he was raised by his stepmother in Denver, Colorado. She persuaded him to attend Yale, where he earned all of his academic degrees: B.A. in 1899, M.A. in 1901 and Ph.D. in 1902.</p>
         <p>After teaching for one year at Bryn Mawr College, he joined the faculty at Yale. There, he taught in the English Department as one of the University's most popular and acclaimed professors, from 1903 until his retirement in 1945, leaving only to serve in the Red Cross and military intelligence during World War I. He also served as Senior Fellow of Davenport College, where he lived for many years, and was instrumental in establishing the Yale Library Associates, founded in 1930. In 1931, he was appointed the first Keeper of Rare Books in the Rare Book Room in Sterling Memorial Library at Yale.</p>
         <p>During his lengthy career, Tinker published many works of his own scholarship, including several books on James Boswell. In 1925 he was the first to view a previously unknown collection of Boswell papers at Malahide Castle in Ireland. This collection was later acquired by Colonel Ralph Heyward Isham and subsequently came to Yale. Tinker was also one of the foremost collectors of his age in the field of English literature, and his collection is now at Yale.</p>

         <p>The Chauncey Brewster Tinker Papers document the life and career of Chauncey Brewster Tinker. The Papers include correspondence, writings, personal papers, financial records, photographs, and other papers including subject files, newspaper clippings and printed material. They have been arranged into six series; <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Correspondence

                  Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, consists primarily of letters written to Tinker and third-party correspondence. Where copies or originals of letters written by Tinker exist, a note has been made in the box-and-folder list. Many letters in this series were originally found laid into items in Tinker's rare book and manuscript collection. Where this is the case, a note is enclosed in the folder with the letter. The correspondence generally concerns personal matters, book collecting, and Tinker's research into James Boswell. Also included are four folders of letters from Yale University officials to Tinker, the vast majority of which are acknowledgements for his gifts to the library.</p>
