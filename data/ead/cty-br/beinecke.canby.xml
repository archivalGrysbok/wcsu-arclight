         <head>HENRY SEIDEL CANBY (1878-1961)</head>
         <p>Henry Seidel Canby, educator, literary critic and writer, was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 6, 1878, the son of Edward Tatnall and Ella Augusta Seidel Canby. He received his preparatory education at the Friends School in Wilmington, Delaware and entered Yale College in 1896. Canby graduated in 1899 with a Ph.B degree and a year later became an assistant in English at Yale's Sheffield Scientific School, where in 1903 he advanced to the rank of instructor. In 1905 Canby received his Ph.D from Yale University and was promoted to the position of assistant professor. Canby married Marion Ponsonby Gause ("Lady") in 1907; they had two sons, Edward Tatnall Canby and Courtlandt Canby.</p>
         <p>During his early years at Yale, in addition to his teaching activities, Canby edited the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Yale Review
            </title> from 1911-1922 and served as an advisor in literary composition from 1916-1922. In that year, he was appointed lecturer in English with the rank of professor. His other teaching activities included appointments as a summer lecturer in English at Dartmouth College (1910-1911) and at the University of California (1923). In 1918, while engaged in liaison work for the British Ministry of Information, Canby also lectured at Cambridge University. In 1945, Canby conducted a series of lectures at the University of Melbourne and other Australian universities under the auspices of the United States Office of War Information.</p>
         <p>Canby's first book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Short Story
            </title>, was published in 1902. His second book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Short Story in English
            </title> (1909), soon became the standard text in the field. Canby also published several literary biographies and works of literary criticism, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Education by Violence
            </title> (1919), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Age of Confidence
            </title> (1934); <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Walt Whitman: An American
            </title> (1943), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               American Memoir
            </title> (1947), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Turn West, Turn East: Mark Twain and Henry James
            </title> (1951). He collaborated with Robert Spiller and others on <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Literary History of the United States
            </title> (1948).</p>
         <p>In 1920, Canby founded <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Literary Review
            </title>, a critical literary supplement to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The New York Post
            </title>, which he also edited for a number of years. After <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The New York Post
            </title> changed ownership in 1924, Canby and others established <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Saturday Review of Literature
            </title>. Canby was editor until 1936, when he was named chairman of the Board of Editors. He remained in this post until his retirement in 1958. In 1926, Canby became editor-in-chief for the newly formed Book-of-the-Month Club, holding that position until 1954. He also was active in many professional literary associations, including the Modern Language Association of America, the Century Association and P. E. N.</p>
         <p>Henry Seidel Canby, who maintained a lifelong residence in Killingworth, Connecticut, died in Ossining, New York, on April 5, 1961.</p>

                  Professional Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, contains alphabetically arranged correspondence between Henry Seidel Canby and educators, literary critics, publishers, writers and other public figures. Much of the correspondence concerns articles and reviews for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Literary Review
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Saturday Review of Literature
            </title>, book candidates for the Book-of-the-Month Club, and Canby's publishing projects.</p>
         <p>Letters from Sherwood Anderson contain Anderson's reflections on writing and a literary career. Mary Austin wrote extensively of her life in Santa Fe, New Mexico, women and reviews of her work. The letters of Stephen Vincent Benét include comments on Canby's work and remarks about reviews of Benét's own writing. Correspondence with T. S. Eliot concerns Eliot's contributions to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Saturday Review of Literature
            </title>, including his refusal to review the poetry of Edward Arlington Robinson. In a letter dated Nov. 25, 1920, Robert Frost offers his opinion of the writing of Ezra Pound.</p>
         <p>A series of letters to Canby from Ezra Pound begins with one from 1920 in which Pound requests information on the intellectual content of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Literary Review
            </title>. Later letters contain Pound's commentary on various people, including Richard Aldington, Ford Madox Ford and T. S. Eliot, and complaints about "intellectual cowardice" in England. In an undated and, apparently, final letter, Pound comments angrily on an unidentified review.</p>
         <p>Canby's long affiliation with Yale University is documented in letters from several University presidents, including James Rowland Angell, Arthur Twinning Hadley and Charles Seymour. Topics discussed include a range of faculty concerns and other University business. Among the letters from William Lyon Phelps are commentaries on Canby's writing projects and letters of introduction, including one to J. M. Barrie written for Canby's visit to England in 1918. A June 30, 1900 letter from Anson Phelps Stokes announces Canby's appointment as Assistant in English at the Sheffield Scientific School. Letters from Charles Scribner's Sons for the years 1910-1912 concern publication of an edition of the selected works of Robert Louis Stevenson for use by the freshmen English classes of the Sheffield Scientific School. The letters contain discussions of royalty payments to the Stevenson estate, as well as editorial details.</p>
         <p>During World War I, Canby corresponded extensively with Robert Bridges about The Society for Pure English, which was formed at that time to promote mutual understanding between the United States and the Allies. Canby's correspondence details the formation of the society as well as its general operations.</p>
         <p>Other correspondents of note in this series include Léonie Adams, Hermann Broch, James Branch Cabell, Willa Cather, Jerome Davis, Bernard Faÿ, Dorothy Fisher Canfield, Dudley Fitts, Kimball Flaccus, Alyse Gregory, Ernest Hemingway, Edward M. House, Aldous Huxley, Sinclair Lewis, Vachel Lindsay, H. L. Mencken, Christopher Morley, Constance Rourke, Llewelyn Powys, Edith Sitwell, H. M. Tomlinson, H. G. Wells, and Thornton Wilder.</p>

                  Family Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, contains correspondence between Henry Seidel Canby and members of his immediate family. These include his parents, Edward Tatnall and Ella Augusta Seidel Canby, (with the majority of the letters having been written by his mother), his sister, Marion (Kit) Canby, and his wife, Marion Ponsonby Canby (Lady). Most of the letters date from the period 1897-1918; there are a few additional letters from the years 1925-26, and several letters written by Canby from Australia in 1945. The series is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent.</p>
         <p>Much of the correspondence with his parents is from Canby's early years at Yale. Letters from his mother contain a predictable measure of family news, details of daily life, and parental advice. Canby's own letters describe life at Yale at the turn of the century, while a series of letters from his sister, Kit, describes her life as a student at Vassar College.</p>
         <p>Canby's letters from his wife, Marion Ponsonby Canby, date primarily from March 1906-June 1907, the period just prior to their marriage. In them she discusses in detail plans for their upcoming wedding and news of mutual friends. A group of letters to his wife from 1918 chronicles his wartime visit to England. Others, written to Marion in 1945, record Canby's lecture tour in Australia under the auspices of the United States Office of War Information.</p>
