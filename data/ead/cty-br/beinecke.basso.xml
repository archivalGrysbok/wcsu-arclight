         <head>HAMILTON BASSO (1904-1964)</head>
         <p>Joseph Hamilton Basso was born September 5, 1904 in New Orleans, Louisiana. His early years were spent in the French Quarter of the city, where his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, had established a successful shoe factory. He attended Tulane University, first studying law, but eventually concentrating on journalism and literature, though he did not take a degree. The change in his scholarly interests was precipitated by his association with a group of southern writers who contributed to the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Double Dealer
            </title>, published in New Orleans, the magazine that would eventually publish the first of Basso's own work. Included in this group were writers with whom Basso established lasting friendships, including Sherwood Anderson, William Faulkner, and Edmund Wilson.</p>
         <p>In 1926, Basso moved to New York City, establishing himself for a few years in Greenwich Village. He soon moved back to his native New Orleans, where he progressively established himself as a writer and editor at all three of the city's newspapers, including the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Times-Picayune
            </title>. His first novel, the semi-autobiographic <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Relics and Angels
            </title>, was published in 1929. The work garnered little acclaim and Basso would later dismiss it as a piece of juvenilia. His next work, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Beauregard, the Great Creole
            </title> (1933), a biography of the Confederate general, was a success, allowing Basso to move to the mountain retreat Pisgah Forest, North Carolina to work on his next novel, accompanied by his wife, Etolia (née Simmons) and their infant son, Keith.</p>
         <p>Basso's efforts of the 1930s established him as a novelist of note. His <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cinnamon Seed
            </title> (1934) was well received, as was <title type="simple" render="italic">
               In Their Own Image
            </title> (1935) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Courthouse Square
            </title> (1936), which was optioned to be made into a motion picture. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Days Before Lent
            </title>, published in 1939, became widely acclaimed, winning the Southern Writer's Award for 1940. The film version of the novel, retitled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Holiday for Sinners
            </title>, was released 12 years later. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sun in Capricorn
            </title>, a novel about the struggle of a Yale graduate against the wiles of a southern politician named Gilgo Slade, who was fashioned after Huey Long, was issued in 1940. In 1943, Basso published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mainstream
            </title>, a collection of profiles of famous Americans, including Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
         <p>During the productive years of the 1930s and 1940s, Basso resumed his editorial work by moving to New York to write for several nationally known magazines. Beginning with <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Republic
            </title> in 1935-37, and continuing at <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Time
            </title> from 1942-43, Basso eventually established himself as an associate editor at the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Yorker
            </title> in 1943, a position he held until 1964. The <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Yorker
            </title> gave him the opportunity to work with a variety of other writers and to publish his own short fiction and nonfiction.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The World from Jackson Square
            </title>, a collection of writings about New Orleans, published in 1948, was done in conjunction with his wife. In 1954, Basso published what is likely his most widely-read book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The View from Pompey's Head
            </title>. The novel, concerning the conflicting emotions of a Southern expatriate who must confront his heritage when he is called back to his hometown, the fictional Pompey's Head, South Carolina, stayed on the best-seller lists for the better part of a year. The movie, made from the book the following year, proved to be just as successful.</p>
         <p>Though Basso and his family settled in Weston, Connecticut in the 1940s, he had a passion for travel. Many of his voyages would provide background for his work. After writing several short pieces for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Holiday
            </title> magazine, Basso issued some of his essays as a collection, titled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Quota of Seaweed
            </title>, in 1960.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Light Infantry Ball
            </title>, a prequel to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The View from Pompey's Head
            </title> and the second in a unfinished trilogy about the town, was issued in 1961. Basso's final novel, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Touch of the Dragon
            </title>, was published shortly after he died of cancer on May 13, 1964 in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Hamilton Basso Papers consist of letters, manuscripts, photographs, legal and financial documents, and printed material concerning the working and publishing career of the author. The papers span the years 1851-1975, but are concentrated in the period 1929-64.</p>
         <p>The collection is housed in 22 boxes and consists of three series: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Correspondence
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">

                  Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, covers the years 1927-73. Included here are letters to and from Hamilton Basso and his family, colleagues, readers and publishing companies. The letters from Hamilton Basso to his wife Etolia discuss his activities while away on a series of trips between 1942 and 1960. Letters from February and March 1942 involve Basso's sojourn in Florida where he met Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. Between 1957 and 1960, Basso traveled to Rio de Janeiro, the South Seas, Scandinavia, and Finland to do research for articles. His letters reflect his admiration for foreign settings and his interactions with natives in both urban and rural areas. Basso later corresponded with many people he met during this period, including the Danielsson family and Emmerik Jensen.</p>
         <p>Basso's professional correspondence involved a number of publishing companies and fellow authors. Letters from Thomas Wolfe, written from 1935 until his death in 1938, concern Wolfe's growing notoriety and friends such as F. Scott Fitzgerald. A 28-page letter from Wolfe to Maxwell Perkins dated December 15, 1936 discusses Wolfe's personal philosophy, his writing, and his opinion of influential books such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Ulysses
            </title>. Maxwell Perkins's letters to Hamilton Basso from August and October 1938 concern Thomas Wolfe before and after the author's death.</p>
         <p>Jade Snow-Wong, a sculptor from San Francisco, corresponded with Basso in the mid-1950s and sent him copies of letters written during her trip to Japan, Hong Kong, and India in 1953. During this same period, Basso received a number of fan letters from readers of his best-selling novel, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The View from Pompey's Head
            </title>. Many of these can be found in the "Letter" general folders.</p>
         <p>Correspondence with publishing companies reveals the often arduous process of negotiation. The Doubleday &amp; Co., Inc. letters from 1955 reflect the success of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The View from Pompey's Head
            </title>, while later letters from 1962 concern the growing incompatibility between author and publisher.</p>

               </title> 
            </ref>, covering the years 1878-1964, contains drafts of most of Hamilton Basso's later works and a number of short pieces written early in his career. The first subseries covers books written by or contributed to by Hamilton Basso. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The View from Pompey's Head
            </title> exists in three versions. A draft typescript is followed by a setting typescript, which was made into a final galley proof for the book. These stages are evident for other titles such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Quota of Seaweed
            </title>. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Light Infantry Ball
            </title> also includes an advance proof of the book and several folders of notes, both written and collected by Basso in preparation for this tale of the Civil War period.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Touch of the Dragon
            </title>, Basso's final published work, exists in several stages of development. Begun as a short story entitled "Edwina and the Kangaroo," this story went through at least three distinct drafts before being typeset for publication. The pages of the first and second drafts are not in precise numerical order, because numerous additions and duplicate pages which had to be kept in the sequence in which they were received.</p>
         <p>An unpublished novel, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Swing of the Compass
            </title>, also has many variant pages intermingled in its separate drafts. Draft 3 represents the most cohesive text of this book. Included before the drafts are files of notes, typewritten outlines, character sketches, and printed materials which help trace the development of the Basso's idea from a storyline called "Adam's Profession" to the final 378-page manuscript.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sun in Capricorn
            </title>, Basso's 1942 novel about southern politics, is present in several forms, exhibiting a different process of revision than that seen with other manuscripts. For a Popular Library edition of the book in 1961, Basso took copies of his original hardcover novel and revised its pages, making additions and deletion by inserting typewritten notes throughout. One copy of the original hardcover novel contains notes for a play based on the book, while another was used as a setting copy for the paperback edition.</p>
         <p>Basso contributed the introduction to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Exploration of the Valley of the Amazon
            </title> by William Lewis Herndon in a reprinted edition of this title from 1952. Drafts of his essay and the final galley proofs are included here as is a setting typescript of another work of fiction, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Green Room
            </title>, from 1949.</p>
         <p>The second subseries, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Shorter Works
            </title>, contains many short stories from Basso's early years in New York and New Orleans. Many of these stories center around a character named Quimby. Profiles of writers (Thomas Wolfe, Eugene O'Neill) and notes for various projects (The USA, Cuba, 1952, Letters from America) make up the later works in this subseries.</p>
