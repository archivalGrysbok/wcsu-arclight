         <p>Upon acquisition, the Mathew B. Brady and Levin Corbin Handy Photographic Studios Collection had no discernible order and many items had damage or soiling. A group of flexible photographic negatives were discarded due to severe deterioration.</p>
         <p>The processing archivist did not distinguish the rank of military officers and soldiers in the photographic imagery, nor establish individual photographers or dates of images.</p>
         <p>In April 2015, library staff revised the finding aid to reflect the storage of photographic material on broken glass carriers, as well as correcting typographical errors.</p>

         <head>Mathew B. Brady (circa 1823-1896)</head>
         <p>Mathew B. Brady (circa 1823-1896) was an American photographer who achieved prominence through his portrait photographs and his organization of photographers to document the American Civil War from his studio in Washington, D.C.</p>
         <p>Born in Warren County, New York, to Irish immigrant parents, Brady learned the daguerreotype process in Saratoga, New York. By 1844, he operated a daguerreotype studio in New York, New York. The following year he established his gallery of illustrious Americans, which consisted of daguerreotype portraits of American celebrities, he published a portion as lithographic reproductions in 1850.</p>
         <p>In 1849, Brady established a studio in Washington D.C., with the expectation of creating portraits of senators and congressional representatives, but he closed it within a year due to high operating expenses and local competition. While in Washington, he met Juliette Handy, whom he married two years later. Around this time, Brady's eyesight began to fail and he concentrated on the management of his studios, which included posing sitters for their portraits, while employees created the photographs. In 1853, he opened a second studio in New York, New York.</p>
         <p>In 1858, Brady re-established a studio in Washington D.C., with Alexander Gardner as his primary photographer. With the onset of the American Civil War, Brady organized a corps of photographers and assistants to document the people, events, and locales of the war. Photographers in this group included George N. Barnard, Alexander Gardner, James Gardner, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, William Pywell, and Thomas C. Roche. The photographers created conventional portraits of individuals and groups, views of military encampments, and the aftermath of battles. Images published or adapted as engravings in publications had the credit "Photograph by Brady."</p>
         <p>Brady sought to market images of the American Civil War with little success. During the war, he transferred many original glass plate negatives to the photographic supply firm of E. &amp; H. T. Anthony &amp; Company to settle his debts with the company. In 1942, the Library of Congress purchased much of this material, where it became the Anthony-Taylor-Rand-Ordway-Eaton Collection.</p>
         <p>Brady spent an estimated $100,000 to print ten thousand photographic prints documenting the American Civil War, but a lack of customers required him to sell his studios in New York and Washington and declare bankruptcy. In 1875, he finally sold a bulk of his photographs to the United States government for $25,000. Much of this material became part of the files of the Department of War eventually deposited in the United States National Archives and Records Administration. Nevertheless, Brady remained deeply in debt.</p>
         <p>By 1883, Brady formed a photographic partnership with his nephew, Levin Corbin Handy, and Samuel C. Chester, to market images from the American Civil War and maintain a photographic studio in Washington. In 1887, Juliette Handy Brady died. Brady continued to face financial difficulties through the remainder of his life. On January 15, 1896, Brady died in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York, New York, from complications following a streetcar accident. After his death, his remaining photography files became the property of Levin Corbin Handy.</p>

         <head>Levin Corbin Handy (1855-1932)</head>
         <p>Levin Corbin Handy (1855-1932), an American photographer, was a nephew and former apprentice of Mathew B. Brady.</p>
         <p>Born in Washington, D.C., the son of Samuel S. Handy and Mary A. Handy, Handy began working in the Brady studio as an apprentice in 1867. He soon demonstrated himself as a skilled camera operator, and established his own photographic business in Washington by 1871.</p>
         <p>Around 1880, Handy entered a photographic partnership with Samuel C. Chester. They operated a studio in Cape May, New Jersey in 1882. By 1883, Handy and Chester partnered with Brady to market images from the American Civil War. Chester ultimately left the partnership, while Handy maintained the studio at his home and studio located at 494 Maryland Avenue Southwest, Washington, D.C. When Mathew B. Brady died in 1896, his remaining photography files became the property of Handy.</p>
         <p>In Washington, the L.C. Handy Studio offered an array of traditional photographic services, in particular to the Library of Congress and other governmental agencies. He also provided photograph duplication services to patrons of the Library of Congress and to members of the United States Congress.</p>
         <p>Handy died at his home on March 23, 1932. He bequeathed his studio and photographic files, including his collection of Mathew B. Brady, to his daughters, Alice H. Cox and Mary H. Evans. In 1954, the Library of Congress purchased approximately ten thousand original, duplicate, and copy negatives from Cox and Evans.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection consists primarily of photographs created by the studios of Mathew B. Brady and his nephew and former apprentice, Levin Corbin Handy, in Washington, D.C.</p>
         <p>The collection includes imagery created by photographers employed by Brady during the American Civil War and documents his marketing of that imagery, as well as the continuing efforts of the Levin C. Handy Studio to promote and market this wartime imagery into the early twentieth century. The collection also documents the functioning of photographic studios in Washington, D.C., from the middle of the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, and the personal photography and papers of the Handy family. The collection includes the work of other photographers and photographic studios collected by Handy, as well as artifacts related to photography.</p>
         <p>This collection largely represents photographic material retained by Handy's daughters. Other photographic materials created by Brady and his studios were transferred to creditors during the American Civil War, purchased by the United States government in 1875, or purchased by Library of Congress in 1954. At the time of processing this collection, many of the images created by the Brady studio were available in digital form from the United States National Archives and Records Administration and the Library of Congress via the Internet.</p>
         <p>Each folder in the collection contains a single photographic print, except where two or more photographic prints are noted, and each sleeve contains a single photographic negative, except where two or more film negatives are noted.</p>

                     <p>A disbound stock photograph album of mounted studio portraits reprinted by the studio of Levin Corbin Handy from images originally created by the Mathew B. Brady Studio. Photographic prints that depict individuals are enlarged and cropped from original glass plate negatives for cartes-de-visite to create head and shoulders portraits of the individuals.</p>

                     <p>Pages from the album are arranged in original order. Each folder contains two leaves (four pages), representing the construction of the album. Each page contains multiple photographic prints, which are described as they appear on the pages from left to right and top to bottom. Some photographic prints are missing, but information about the image number and subject taken from manuscript notes on the leaves is included in the description. The numbers associated with the photographic prints are written on the pages in pencil and ink inscriptions. Some prints are detached from their page. They are placed in the appropriate folder based on identification of the subject.</p>

                     <p>Much of the early correspondence under this heading deals with family financial matters. This includes a letter of indenture of William Henry Bright (the brother of Mary Ann Bright Handy and uncle of Levin Corbin Handy), 1843.</p>
                     <p>Letters from Robert Handy, serving aboard the United States Revenue Cutters <emph render="italic">Morris</emph> and <emph render="italic">Howard</emph>, to his brother Samuel S. Handy in 1850 include mentions of Brady and his wife living on Staten Island, New York, and the aftermath of the sinking of the bark, <emph render="italic">Elizabeth</emph>, on July 19, 1850.</p>
                     <p>Letters from Levin Corbin Handy to his then future wife, Emma Sussanna Gessford, include one asking her to attend a prayer meeting in 1874, as well as love poems he wrote to her in 1875 and undated. They were married in 1879.</p>

                  <p>Underwood &amp; Underwood was an early producer and distributor of stereoscopic and other photographic images, and became a pioneer in the field of news-bureau photography. It was founded in 1882 in Ottawa, Kansas by brothers, Elmer Underwood (1859-1947) and Bert Underwood (1862-1943). They moved their operations to Baltimore, Maryland, and to New York, New York, in 1891. In 1920, the company sold most of its catalog of stereographs to the Keystone View Company.</p>
