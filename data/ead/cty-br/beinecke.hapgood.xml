         <head>HUTCHINS HAPGOOD (1869-1944)</head>
         <p>Hutchins Hapgood, journalist and author, was born on May 21, 1869 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Charles Hutchins and Fanny Louise Collins Powers Hapgood. Hutchins's father, descended from a long line of Massachusetts Hapgoods, moved west prior to the Civil War to seek his fortune. After an unsuccessful law practice and several business failures, Charles Hutchins Hapgood settled in Alton, Illinois, and eventually became a successful plow manufacturer. In their latter years the Hapgoods traveled frequently throughout America and Europe and included many prominent individuals within their social circle, most notably the Robert Todd Lincolns and the Samuel Clemenses.</p>
         <p>Hutchins Hapgood received his early education in the Alton public schools. Like his father and two brothers, he attended Harvard University, receiving the B.A. degree in 1892 and the M.A. in 1897. In the interim he spent two years in study at the universities of Berlin and Freiburg, Germany, reading sociology and philosophy, and also traveled extensively. For a time he was an instructor in English composition at Harvard and the University of Chicago. After trying his hand at various jobs, Hapgood eventually decided to become a journalist like his older brother Norman.</p>
         <p>Charles Hutchins Hapgood had a tremendous influence upon the character of his sons. Although not a religious man, he imparted to them a strong moral sense, an abhorance of great wealth, and a basic belief in progressive socialism. This, coupled with a liberal Harvard education and appropriate connections, led Hutchins Hapgood into the thick of muckraking journalism. His first newspaper job was with the New York <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Commercial Advertiser
            </title> under the tutelage of Lincoln Steffens. Here he met Steffen's assistant, Neith Boyce, whom he married on June 22, 1899.</p>
         <p>In 1904 Hapgood became the drama critic for the Chicago <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Evening Post
            </title>. Returning to New York, he later became an editorial writer for the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Evening Post
            </title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Press
            </title>, and the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Globe
            </title>. While maintaining his career as a journalist, Hapgood also wrote books. During the first decade of the twentieth century, he produced the bulk of his major works, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Paul Jones
            </title> (1901), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Spirit of the Ghetto
            </title> (1902), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Autobiography of a Thief
            </title> (1903), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Spirit of Labor
            </title> (1907), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               An Anarchist Woman
            </title> (1909), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Types from City Streets
            </title> (1910). The anonymously published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Story of a Lover
            </title> (1919), describing the "open" marriage which he and Neith maintained, was initially suppressed as pornographic. Hapgood's last great work was his autobiography, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Victorian in the Modern World
            </title> (1933).</p>
         <p>Hutchins Hapgood was a close friend of Mabel Dodge Luhan and an habitué of her salon at 23 Fifth Avenue. Other close friends included Bernard and Mary Berenson, Jacob Epstein, Max Eastman, Anton Johanson, Walter Lippmann, Robert Morss Lovett, Gertrude and Leo Stein, Alfred Stieglitz, Maurice Sterne, and Mark Sullivan. He and Neith were founding members of the Provincetown Players.</p>
         <p>Hapgood's career declined following the death of his eldest child, Boyce, in 1918 and the end of the muckracking era. The last several years of his life he spent with Neith in Key West, Florida, at their home in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and on a farm in Richmond, New Hampshire. Hutchins Hapgood died on November 19, 1944, in Provincetown, and was buried in the family plot in East Cemetery, Petersham, Massachusetts.</p>

         <head>NEITH BOYCE HAPGOOD (1872-1951)</head>
         <p>Neith Boyce Hapgood, author, was born on March 21, 1872 in Franklin, Indiana, the daughter of Henry Harrison and Mary Ella Smith Boyce. She spent her formative years primarily in Los Angeles where her father, a former Union captain in the Civil War, was part-owner of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Los Angeles Times
            </title>. Her mother was one of the founders of the Flower Festival, forerunner of the Tournament of Roses parade. Henry Boyce later sold his interest in the newspaper and entered real estate. This proved successful until an economic downturn forced Boyce into bankruptcy. The family then relocated to Boston for a few years before settling in New York.</p>
         <p>As a child, Neith exhibited a keen interest in books and later began writing stories, some of which her father published in his newspaper. After the family moved East her father frequently asked her for stories to publish. As a young woman, she was a frequent contributor to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Vogue
            </title> magazine. Neith Boyce's first full-time job in journalism was as a reporter with the New York <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Commercial Advertiser
            </title>, where she was the assistant to the city editor, Lincoln Steffens. She married Hutchins Hapgood on June 22, 1899, and had four children: Harry Boyce, Charles Hutchins, Miriam, and Beatrix.</p>
         <p>Neith soon left journalism and devoted her time to writing and to the demands of motherhood. Her major works include: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Forerunner
            </title> (1903), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Folly of Others
            </title> (1904), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Eternal Spring
            </title> (1906), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Bond
            </title> (1908), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Two Sons
            </title> (1917), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Proud Lady
            </title> (1923), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Harry: A Portrait
            </title> (1923), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Winter's Night
            </title> (1927). The death of their firstborn of influenza in 1918 had a profound effect upon Neith. The writing of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Harry: A Portrait
            </title>, a memorial to his life, helped to bring her out of a deep mental depression.</p>
         <p>Together with her husband, Neith socialized with the leading members of the artistic world of the United States (both resident and expatriate) during the first two decades of the twentieth century. By the 1930s she had produced all of her major works and spent her remaining years in Key West, Florida, Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Richmond, New Hampshire. She died on December 2, 1951, in Richmond and is buried in the Hapgood family plot in East Cemetery, Petersham, Massachusetts.

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Hapgood Family Papers contain correspondence; manuscripts of books, plays, poems, articles, book reviews, essays, and short stories; business papers, diaries, maps, photographs, subject files, writings of others, and miscellaneous papers which document the lives and careers of various members of the Hapgood family and to a lesser extent the Boyce family, most notably Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce Hapgood. The material spans the years 1829 to 1977, with the bulk falling between 1900 and 1940.</p>
         <p>The papers are housed in forty-eight boxes and are divided into four series. <title type="simple" render="italic">

                  Personal Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>(Boxes 1-8), covers the period 1849-1950 and contains personal correspondence between members of the Hapgood and Boyce families with non-related individuals and business correspondence. The bulk of this material deals with Hutchins Hapgood and/or Neith Boyce Hapgood, although personal and business correspondence of other family members is also present. On the Hapgood side, these include Hutchins's parents Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836-1917) and Fanny Louise Collins Powers Hapgood, his maiden aunt Emma Frances Hapgood who lived with his parents, his brothers Norman Hapgood and William Powers Hapgood, as well as the children of Hutchins and Neith, Harry Boyce Hapgood, Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1904-82), Miriam Hapgood DeWitt, and Beatrix Hapgood Faust. On the Boyce side, correspondents include Neith's parents, Henry Harrison Boyce and Mary Ella Smith Boyce, her sisters Margaret Boyce Bonnell and Faith Boyce, and her neice Elizabeth Boyce Reklaitis.</p>
         <p>Included among the artistic and literary figures with whom the Hapgoods correspondended are Ray Stannard Baker, Arthur F. Bentley, Bernard and Mary Berenson, Bayard Boyesen, George Cram Cook, John Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, Max Eastman, Susan Glaspell, Hippolyte Havel, Robert Herrick, Mabel Dodge Luhan, Lewis Mumford, Georgia O'Keeffe, John Reed, Gertrude and Leo Stein, Maurice Sterne, Alfred Stieglitz, Carl Van Vechten, and Ella Winter. Hutchins's social and political activism is reflected in the correspondence of Abraham Cahan, John Collier, Edward J. Flynn, Emma Goldman, Anton Johannsen, Charles and Marguerite Kaeselau, Matthew and Katherine Schmidt, and Lincoln Steffens.</p>
         <p>During the final years of their lives, Hutchins and Neith worked on a project which aimed to relate the story of the Hapgood family to the history of the United States. This work, entitled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Story of an American Family
            </title>, was eventually published in 1953 (after the death of both Hutchins and Neith). It covered the years 1648 to 1917. In compiling the research materials for this book, Hutchins and Neith acquired copies of significant correspondence from prominent Hapgood family members, most notably that between Norman Hapgood, Hutchins's older brother, and Supreme Court justices Louis D. Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter, Learned Hand, and presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The folder of Theodore Roosevelt's correspondence reflects the relationship between the president and Colonel Henry H. Boyce, Neith's father.</p>
         <p>The business correspondence primarily contains letters Neith exchanged with various magazines and other publishing houses about negotiations on submitted writings. The Letters of Bernard and Mary Berenson (Box 1, folders 17-19) provide information on the American literary circle in Florence over a fifty-year period. The Mabel Dodge Luhan correspondence (Box 5, folders 147-56), describes the activities of the Taos artistic and literary set. The correspondence of Fred J. Bowen (Box 1, folders 22-26) is mainly with Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836-1917) and concerns the management of a 6000-acre cattle ranch he owned in Kansas. Bowen and T. H. O'Brien (Box 6, folder 177) discuss the death of Boyce Hapgood. A free-spirited soul who desired to experience the life of a cowboy on the western plains, Boyce was taken ill in Colorado and died suddenly at the age of eighteen in the influenza epidemic of 1918.</p>
         <p>Scattered throughout the series is correspondence of close personal friends whom Hutchins and Neith knew from Key West, Florida, Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Richmond, New Hampshire. These include Edward and Peggy Bruce, Oliver and Ada Chafee, John and Elizabeth Cowles, Colin and Eva Cruikshank, John and Jane Dewey, Elsie Everts, Leslie Hopkinson, Russell and Katrina Johnson, William and Sally Johnstone, Bill and Lucy L'Engle, Harry Lorber (their personal physician), Eddie MacGowan, Frances Stanwood, Lucile Swan, Ridgley and Olivia Torrence, and Sam and Adele Wolman.</p>

                  Family Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>(Boxes 9-21), covers the period 1849-1950 and contains correspondence among five generations of Hapgoods and, to a lesser extent, Boyce family members. This series provides information on a well-educated and culturally influential American family active in the literary life of the nation during a formative period of American history. It also provides a look at an educated American family typical in respect to its births and deaths, marriages and divorces, joys and sorrows. This material runs the gamut from letters to parents from their children away at summer camp to letters between husband and wife discussing philosophical and metaphysical issues.</p>
         <p>The letters from the nineteenth century provide poignant impressions of everyday life in small New England villages as well as large cities such as Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. For instance, while on a visit to Washington, D.C., Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836-1917) writes in a letter of February 1, 1865, to his mother about attending a reception given by Mrs. Lincoln.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the correspondence was generated by Hutchins and Neith. As they often lived apart, they wrote one another frequently. Boxes 11-13 house Hutchins's letters to Neith; Boxes 18-20, Neith's to Hutchins. The collection also contains considerable correspondence from Hutchins and Neith to their son Charles Hutchins (Boxes 14-18), and to their daughter Miriam (Box 14, folders 402-14), but relatively little to daughter Beatrix (Box 14, folder 415) and son Boyce (Box 18, folders 473-75). The correspondence between Hutchins and his parents and his Aunt Emma provides glimpses into his adolescence, college years and world travels, and his later career. In letters to his aunt and mother, for instance, Hutchins mentions visiting the Samuel Clemenses. Genealogical charts of both Hapgood and Boyce families are provided on pages 14-18.</p>

                  Writings
               </title> 
            </ref> (Boxes 22-44), represents the creative output of Hutchins and Neith Boyce Hapgood. Hutchins Hapgood's writings are divided into three sections, Books, Plays, and Shorter Works. The Books section consists of research notes, manuscript drafts, galley proofs, page proofs, advertisements, publicity, copyright agreements, printed versions, and book reviews of Hutchins's works. The most notable are <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Story of a Lover
            </title>, which recounts the married life of Hutchins and Neith in some detail, and Hutchins's autobiography, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Victorian in the Modern World
            </title>. The Plays section contains manuscript drafts of two plays, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Enemies
            </title>, one of the first works performed by the Provincetown Players. Shorter Works is comprised of Articles, Book Reviews (written by Hutchins on the works of others), Essays, and Letters to the Editor. Articles contains clippings of Hutchins's journalistic writings. Excepting those in Box 27, folders 758 and 792, which were published in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Chicago Evening Post
