         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received a preliminary level of processing at the time of acquisition, including rehousing in acid-free boxes and folders. Material in the collection has yet to be organized. Folder titles appearing in the contents list were transcribed from original folders, but have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles were supplied by staff during preliminary processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Lucy Kramer Cohen (1907-2007)</head>
         <p>Lucy Kramer Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York, graduated from Barnard College in 1928, and earned her Master's degree in 1929 in mathematics and anthropology at Columbia University. She married Felix S. Cohen, a lawyer, in 1931, and they had two daughters, Karen and Gene. Kramer Cohen worked as an unpaid assistant with her husband in the United States Department of the Interior, helping to draft the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and The Handbook of Federal Indian Law in 1942. She was on the staff of Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas (D-Calif.) during Douglas's three terms in the House from 1944 to 1950. Kramer Cohen also worked for the War Labor Board, the Office of Price Administration, the State Department and the Public Health Service, where she wrote and edited reports in its office of data analysis and management. She also did research work for anthropologists in Washington in between her government jobs, and did researching and writing for Interior Secretary Harold Ickes. She collected, edited, and published her husband's work as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Legal Conscience
            </title> (New Haven, Yale University Press: 1960) after his death in 1953. She served on the board of directors of the Association on American Indian Affairs from 1961 to 1994. Kramer Cohen officially retired from the federal government in 1977, but continued to work on contract until her actual retirement in 1989. In her later years, she took up drawing and painting, and served as editor of the Washington Watercolor Association newsletter. She died of a stroke in 2007.</p>
