         <abstract id="aspace_bf1cb182517fdc129fb0401793240719">The Randolph Linsly Simpson African-American Collection consists chiefly of photographs dating from circa 1850 to 1970, but also includes printed illustrations, original artwork, documents and printed ephemera that provide a record of black history in the United States for the period circa 1770 to 1970. The focus is on African-American subjects, but the collection also includes the work of black photographers, as well as images of white men and women, many of whom were associated with the abolitionist movement. Collected with a broad scope, the images provide information about individuals at all socio-economic levels and include people of all ages and gender. They represent the work of professional photographers in various regions of the United States and some European countries, and the image formats present in the collection reflect the development of photographic processes, beginning with Daguerreotypes and extending through mid-twentieth century formats.</abstract>

         <p>A substantial portion of the printed material received with this collection, including books, newspapers, pamphlets, and sheet music, was removed for separate cataloging. Simpson's item numbers were not retained in the catalog records for these items, but his ownership is noted. Printed items that duplicated existing holdings were not retained by the library.</p>

      <processinfo id="aspace_a4490b0c63569201cc97a03311801a62">
         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>This guide was derived from a list received with the collection from Swann Galleries, possibly created for purposes of appraisal. The Swann document may have been based on Simpson's own list of his collection, including his descriptions of the material. For that reason, the library has largely preserved the descriptions from that list, which often include non-standard terminology along with anecdotes and comments about subjects and photographers. In some cases image descriptions have been added where none existed in the original list or expanded to include more detail; obvious typographical errors and errors of transcription were also corrected. Information in the Swann/Simpson list has not been verified, although identifications that were obviously speculative were changed to more objective descriptions of the items.</p>
         <p>Prior to its acquisition by the library, the collection was organized by format, and the subseries titles in this guide represent the format designations on the inherited list. The library further organized these format groupings into series. Three addenda consisting of multiple formats were originally filed at the end of the collection, reflecting the collector's acquisition of material after an initial organization and numbering scheme was complete. The items in these addenda were interfiled into Series I-III by the library in order to facilitate digitization, intellectual access, and appropriate physical housing.</p>
         <p>For some years after acquisition by the library, items in the collection were identified only by the item numbers assigned by Simpson; during processing box and folder numbers were additionally assigned. Simpson's item numbers are retained in a note for each item, and material is arranged by item number within each subseries. Gaps in the item number sequence most often reflect removal for separate cataloging (for example, items 1758-1814, 1889-1931) but a few gaps represent items that were not received by the library.</p>

         <head>Randolph Linsly Simpson (1927-1992)</head>
         <p>The collector Randolph Linsly Simpson was born on June 1, 1927, and grew up both in Rochester, New York, where his father, Charles A. Simpson, worked in banking, and in Northford, Connecticut, at the family home of his mother, Eunice Hall Linsly Simpson. After graduating from the Harley School in Rochester in 1945, he served two years in the U. S. Navy, and later worked as a voice teacher. Simpson lived the latter part of his life at the Linsly homestead in Northford.</p>
         <p>The Linslys were among the first to settle Northford, Connecticut, and many generations of the family attended Yale, from Noah Linsly, Yale 1791, to Simpson's older brother Josiah J. L. Simpson, Yale 1948. Simpson's interest in the material record of black history in America was apparently inspired by his family's abolitionist history, and by the proximity of his childhood home on Mount Hope Avenue in Rochester to the cemetery in which Frederick Douglass is buried.</p>
         <p>Simpson's large collection of images, artifacts, and other memorabilia documenting the African-American experience drew a great deal of interest during his lifetime. In January, 1984, NBC television aired a one-hour special on the collection, "Blacks: Present and Accounted For." A portion of the collection was exhibited at the Connecticut Governor's Mansion in February 1985 and at the Wadsworth Atheneum in February 1987. In 1989 the Wadsworth Atheneum, through the then titled Amistad Foundation, purchased approximately 7,000 items from Simpson.</p>
         <p>Simpson died on January 6, 1992.</p>

         <p>The Randolph Linsly Simpson African-American Collection consists chiefly of photographs dating from circa 1850 to 1970, but also includes printed illustrations, original artwork, documents, and ephemera that provide a record of black history in the United States for the period circa 1770 to 1970. The focus is on African-American subjects, but the collection also includes the work of black photographers, as well as images of white men and women, many of whom were associated with the abolitionist movement. Collected with a broad scope, the photographs represent the work of professional photographers in various regions of the United States and some European countries, and the formats present reflect the development of photographic processes, beginning with Daguerreotypes and extending through mid-twentieth century formats. The collection contains images of Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Marcus Garvey, W. E. B. DuBois, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Sojourner Truth, Louis Armstrong, and Joe Louis, as well as of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, among other highly recognized figures. It also includes a large number of photographic portraits of lesser-known African-American subjects, including politicians, bankers, athletes, entertainers, domestic servants, emancipated slaves, and soldiers. Among the few documents in the collection is a ship manifest listing one slave aboard the "Telegraph," out of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1811. The collection also includes three-dimensional artifacts such as commemorative spoons, lapel buttons, and a plaster bust of Booker T. Washington.</p>
         <p>Note that there is some overlap between the series, and that images can be found not only in Series I. Visual Material, but in Series II. and III. as well. In Series II. Printed Material, several printed documents and booklets include illustrations or postcards. In Series III. Artifacts, images are often incorporated into objects.</p>

               <p>Series I. is organized into fifteen subseries: Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes, Tintypes, Cabinet Photographs, Cartes de Visite, Stereographs, Later 19th Century Photographs, 20th Century Photographs, Postcards, Photographic Postcards, Albums, Novelty Photographs, Prints, Paintings and Drawings, and Film.

               <p>Visual Material consists chiefly of photographic images but also includes a small number of prints, paintings, and drawings. The photographs consist of nineteenth-century formats including Daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, card photographs, stereographs, and larger albumen prints, as well as twentieth-century formats and genres including silver gelatin prints, photomechanical prints, snapshots, and news service photographs. The earlier photographs are predominantly portraits, but later images include outdoor scenes and documentary images of laborers at work in fields, factories, or shipyards, for example. Portrait subjects include slaves and servants, actors and musicians, athletes, military personnel, politicians, and leaders in the abolitionist and civil rights movements. The series also includes prints dating from the late eighteenth century, including engravings, etchings, and lithographs. The image subjects of the prints range from scenes of slavery to portraits of political figures to patriotic illustrations, including World War I posters promoting the military contributions of African Americans.</p>

                  <p>More than one hundred tintypes date from approximately 1850 through 1900. The majority of images in this format depict middle class individuals who pose in professional studios. However, the tinypes also docment exterior scenes and include images of workers including surveyors, teamsters, and railroad porters. Images of Civil War soldiers in uniform include a full-plate portrait of armed black soldiers shown with a backdrop of cannon, drum, and Union flag. An undated miniature depicts three nuns.</p>

                  <p>More than two hundred cabinet photographs date from circa 1870 through 1900. Many of the subjects are unidentified; identified figures include the performer Matilda Sissieretta Jones, the Reconstruction congressman Blanche Kelso Bruce, Henry Ward Beecher, and various portraits of Frederick Douglass and members of his family. A group photo shows members of the South Carolina legislature of 1872, many of them former slaves. Among other group subjects are black lodge members, bands and singing groups (including the Only Original University Singers of New Orleans, circa 1875), university employees (Yale, Amherst, Kenyon, Wilberforce), grooms, carriage makers, farmers, cotton pickers, policemen, soldiers, and families and school children. Also included are portraits of Siamese twins Millie Christine, who were born in North Carolina in 1851, and a lynching scene in Urbana, Ohio, circa 1890.</p>

                     <p>This presentation photo of Douglass appears to have been presented by the photographer to Miss Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) of Rochester, N.Y., abolitionist and suffragette. Miss Anthony showed Mr. Douglass to his seat when he arrived, on the afternoon of February 20, 1895 at the Washington D.C. Women's Convention. It is suggested that the ink inscription on the verso might be that of Miss Anthony herself.</p>

                  <p>Cartes de visite include more than two hundred images spanning circa 1860 to 1890. These include portraits of Frederick Douglass and members of his family; the sculptor Edwina Lewis; and the actor Ira Aldridge. John R. Lynch, speaker of the House of Representitives in Mississippi and one of the first black members of the Reconstruction cabinet, is also identified, as is Josiah Thomas Walls, the first black member of the House of Representitives during Reconstruction. An image of Sojourner Truth by Van Doorn, 1863, is, according to R. L. Simpson, possibly the first published photograph of the subject. Among the Civil War cartes de visite is a field shot of the Seventh New York Regiment, identified as the work of George Barnard. Also present are images of black entertainers, possibly including the Hampton Jubilee Singers who toured American and Europe, as well as other unidentified singers, dancers, instrumentailists, and named figures such as Zumigo the Magician.</p>
                  <p>The Duchess of Sutherland, supporter of Frederick Douglass, is represented in a carte de visite taken in London. Other British subjects include the dramatist Dion Boucicault, producer of the anti-slavery play, "Octoroon," and abolitionist George Thompson. Other white subjects include anti-slavery lecturer Anna Elizabeth Dickenson; Tom Thumb and his wife Lavinia, pictured with their black servant; and Lucretia Mott, feminist and leader in the abolitionist movement. Several white officers assigned to black military units are identified. The cartes de visite also portray black nursemaids with the white children for whom they cared.</p>
                  <p>Among the exterior views is a Brady photograph of the "slave-pen" in Alexandria, Virginia, dated 1862, and scenes of slave cabins located in Helena, Arkansas. Considered rare by the collector is an 1867 outdoor street scene in Kansas taken by an unknown photographer. A set of undated photographs from the Oak Gallery, Memphis, Tennesee, provides images of Jefferson Davis's house, and the "Contraband Yard," among other locations.</p>
                  <p>Included with the portraits of many individuals is anecdotal material found by the collector, such as newspaper clippings. The presence of such material is noted.</p>

At the time the photograph was taken, she was living on Long Island with a Quaker family. This image predates the photographs titled: "I sell the shadow to support the substance" which she took with her and sold during her evangelistic "sojourns" throughout the country.</p>

                  <p>The majority of the stereographs in the collection portray scenes from the south, circa 1850 to 1925. Images of slavery and Reconstruction show the picking and processing of cotton in different southern states and at different scales of operation. Other views show African Americans harvesting rice, peanuts, peaches, and onions, and working as laundresses, grooms, chauffers, and guides. Landmarks such as the Freedom Statue, Washington's Tomb, and John Brown's grave are also represented. The few images of military personnel include several taken by Alexander Gardner during the Civil War, and others of soldiers at mess, in training, and on parade at Camp Upton, New York, in the 1910s.</p>

                  <p>Later Nineteenth Century Photographs include images dated circa 1860 to 1900. These images were produced in a variety of formats, including large mounted albumen prints and smaller-format snapshots. They are largely exterior views: family groups before cabins, for example, or workers in quarries, excavation sites, and railroad yards. Several images chronicle the stages of cotton production, while others show riverboats docked at levees being loaded or unloaded. There are a number of school group photographs, showing interior and exterior views of school buildings and students. Military images include some from the Spanish American War.</p>

                  <p>Subjects in photographs from the twentieth century include industrial workers, municipal employees, and railroad employees, as well as members of lodges, civic and business organizations. Individual portraits and those of couples young and old are chiefly unidentified; prominent politicians, educators, and artists and entertainers are among the easily recognizable figures. School photographs include athletic teams as well as individual graduation portraits, and while most are from New England, images from Baltimore, Maryland, Birmingham, Alabama, and Howard University are also present. Also included are views of Army and Navy personnel during World War II, a parade of black veterans of the Spanish American War, and images of the Wilkins Guard of the Connecticut National Guard.</p>
                  <p>Images from the later twentieth century are primarily press photographs with placement information attached. Many are from the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                        Hartford Courant
                     </title> or other local photographic services in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Others were published by the Associated Press and United Press International. These include publicity stills of entertainers and other prominent personalities, but many of the images document events of local or national interest, including the wedding of Madame C. J. Walker's granddaughter, the eightieth anniversary celebration of a local church, Thurgood Marshall's appointment to the Supreme Court, and Louis Armstrong presenting Duke Ellington with awards from the Down Beat critics poll. Images of the 1970 NBA and NCAA Men's Basketball championships are among the few relating to athletes.</p>

                  <p>Postcards consists of photomechanically reproduced images dating from circa 1900 through the 1970s, although the majority were published before the 1930s. Subjects include notable personalities, views of the Old South, caricatures, landmarks, and workers engaged in activities such as cotton picking and the processing of tobacco. Portraits include those of boxers and football players, entertainers including Fats Waller and Josephine Baker, and other notable figures including Martin Luther King, Jr. and descendents of Frederick Douglass. Also present is a sequence of postcards bearing lyrics to old "coon songs," illustrated with images of the antebellum south, views of old slave markets preserved as historical sites, houses identified as former stations on the Underground Railroad, and individual portraits of men and women, including centenarians identified as former slaves. A significant number of postcards were created for advertising purposes; hotels, funeral homes, and insurance companies are among the types of businesses advertised. There are also examples from schools and universities that used this format for publicity purposes, including a sequence of images of Hampton Institute. Military views include images of Camp Bartlett, Fort Leonard Wood and Fort McClellan.</p>

                  <p>Photographic Postcards consist of photographically reproduced images printed in postcard format. While there are here some subjects in common with the photomechanical postcards, portraits predominate in this subseries. These include formal and informal portraits of individuals, young couples and groups of friends, graduates, families and co-workers. Also present are publicity portraits of radio, film, and television actors, musicians, and professional athletes; images of military personnel including the 25th Infantry and 10th U. S. Cavalry from World War I, and soldiers and sailors from World War II. Other images include cooks, laundresses, and municipal workers, and a group of images depicts the Lewis Plantation and Turpentine Still in Florida.</p>

                     <p>Most subjects are typical standing or seated portraits of the period; some wear caps, some not; some are armed. Three are identified in pencil in the collector's hand, two of these (of enlisted men) were acquired separately and one is a duplicate (identities supplied by vendor), the third refers to one of the figures in the one double portrait, which is of two white officers, one is Lt. Wright who assembled the album. Most bear either a two cent orange, or a three cent green revenue stamp. The album is heavily embossed morocco, with arched openings and gold decorative lines; each slot is identified as to the soldier whose photograph was mounted in it, thus identifying the entire unit including those who's photographs are missing.</p>
                     <p>Dedication reads, "Sarah A. Wright's Album. Photographs of Officers and Privates of the 108th Regiment of the U.S.C.T. Taken at Rock Island, Ill. in 1865. Sent by Lt. T.F. Wright to his Mother."</p>

               <p>Series II consists of broadsides, documents, printed ephemera, and a small amount of manuscript material. Broadsides mainly address the issue of slavery. Several documents relate to African American military service during the American War for Independence and the Civil War; there is one ship manifest for slaves aboard the "Telegraph" in 1811. Also included are voter solicitations, organizational fliers, and circulars covering a range of topics, as well as church, concert, and theatre programs, advertising materials, postage stamps, and a series of patriotic and comemmorative envelopes. Two scrapbooks of newspaper clippings document political events of the 1870s and black performers and sports figures of the 1930s.</p>
