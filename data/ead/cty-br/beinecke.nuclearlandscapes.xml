               <p>Inkjet prints of photographs by Peter Goin that document nuclear test sites at Nevada Test Site, Nevada, and at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, as well as the radioactive waste repository at Hanford Site, Washington, circa 1986-1988, and printed by Scott C. Hinton in 2011.</p>
               <p>The inkjet prints are on Canson Infinity Rag Photographique paper, 310 grams per square meter. The prints have images 28 x 36 cm on paper 41 x 51 cm except for the panorama, which has an image 36 x 146 cm on paper 46 x 155 cm. Captions also appear in the printed images. Versos signed and numbered by the photographer.</p>
               <p>The title page is printed on Rives BFK heavyweight tan paper, 280 grams per square meter, by Robert E. Blesse of the Black Rock Press, and uses a graphic created by Goin.</p>
               <p>The title for each print is followed by parenthetical expressions that first document Goin's negative number and secondly provide the page number that the image appeared in Goin's, <title>
                     Nuclear Landscapes
                  </title> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991) or if it did not appear in the book. Notes provide description of the images by Goin.</p>
               <p>The prints are housed into two custom portfolio cases with sheets of acid-free paper interleaved by the creators.</p>
               <p>Laid in box 1 is a checklist and colophon information as well as a biographical statement for Goin.</p>

                     <p>"This crater remains from the Plowshares program, the purpose of which was to test the peaceful use of nuclear explosions. The operating hypothesis was that a nuclear explosion could easily excavate a large area, facilitating the building of canals and roads, improving mining techniques, or simply moving a large amount of rock and soil. The intensity and distribution of radiation proved too great, and the program was abandoned. The 'Sedan' device was thermonuclear - 70 percent fusion, 30 percent fission - with a yield of 100 kilotons. The crater is an impressive 635 feet deep and 1,280 feet wide. The weight of the material lifted was 12 million tons."</p>

A drilling crew then prepared the site for ground zero - right in the middle of the road, about 1,500 feet below the surface. The detonation destroyed the road and created this subsidence crater (the ground collapses into the cavity by the blast)."</p>

Although the surrounding area is composed of rock rather than sediment, and a subsidence crater therefore did not form at the time of the test, geologists cannot guarantee that one will not develop in the future. The large flat area that resembles a baseball diamond was cleared to accommodate numerous trailers containing evaluation equipment. The blast caused accelerated rock erosion in the bluffs visible at middle distance."</p>

Starting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the nuclear remains traveled down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, into the Gulf of Mexico, through the Panama Canal, up the Pacific Coast, and finally inland on the Columbia River to Hanford, where it arrived in April 1986. Land disposal was selected for reactor compartments and sea burial for the remainder of the submarine. The excavation for the reactor is 200 feet by 200 feet by 50 feet. Each compartment is 38 feet long, 30 feet in diameter, and weighs over 1,000 tons. The compartment hull will resist corrosion for at least 200 years, and the reactor pressure vessel for 1,000 years. More compartments· will be deposited here before burial is finally completed."</p>

Because Hanford was already a nuclear area, this site was chosen as one of three possible national storage areas. The dominant subsurface basalt formations were thought to be suitable "containers" for nuclear waste. This is the entrance to one of three test tunnels in the Near-Surface Test Facility. The tunnels have been sealed, and plans for storing waste in this area have been suspended in response to objections voice by Washington political delegations."</p>

Some were welded naturally into the coral tidal areas throughout Bikini and Enewetak atolls, creating an unnatural beauty. The Marshall Island sites of Bikini and Enewetak are still radioactive."</p>

During the period of 'clean-up,' 111,000 cubic yards of radioactively contaminated soil and debris were entombed beneath an 18-inch-thick concrete dome. It took three years and cost $120 million to collect the debris. The crypt is constructed of 358 concrete panels that were built at the site. Later, male workers from the Department of Energy painted oil can red and placed it at the top of the dome. They then painted a large pink circle around the oil can. From the air, this nuclear dome looks like a huge breast."</p>
