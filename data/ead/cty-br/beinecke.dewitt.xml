         <head>Miriam Hapgood DeWitt</head>
         <p>Miriam Hapgood DeWitt was the daughter of the journalists and authors Hutchins Hapgood (1869-1944) and Neith Boyce (1872-1951). She was born in Florence, Italy, on November 29, 1906, and, along with her siblings Harry Boyce (1901-1918), Charles Hutchins (1904-1982) and Beatrix (1910-1994), was raised in the family's homes in New York and Provincetown, Massachusetts. As an adult, she lived in Taos, New Mexico, through 1945, then in Washington, D.C., through 1979, after which she settled in Provincetown and resided there until her death on April 16, 1990. DeWitt worked briefly for the federal government while in Washington, and also had a successful career as a painter. Her first marriage, to Edward Hamilton Bright (1894-1954) in 1930, produced two sons but ended in divorce; her second, in 1947 to the Croatian-born economist, writer, and educator Vaso Trivanovitch (ca. 1899-1949), ended at his death; and her third, in 1956 to the writer and Department of the Interior administrator John DeWitt (1910-1984), also ended in divorce.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Miriam Hapgood DeWitt Papers consists of original and photocopied material related to the writers Hutchins Hapgood (1869-1944) and Neith Boyce (1872-1951), their forebears, and their circle of intellectuals, social reformers, and artists. The collection was created by their daughter Miriam Hapgood DeWitt (1906-1990) with the assistance of her sister Beatrix Hapgood Faust (1910-1994), as the women endeavored to gather and publish an annotated selection of their parents' correspondence while working closely with scholars interested in their parents' lives.</p>
         <p>Although the collection contains a good selection of original items, including a diary and scrapbook, and some correspondence and literary writings, the bulk of the papers is a chronologically arranged set of copies of letters sent between Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce and their friends and family. As writers covering social causes in the first two decades of the twentieth century, and founders of the amateur theatre company Provincetown Players, Hapgood and Boyce formed close lifetime associations with activists, anarchists, artists, and authors in America and abroad. DeWitt and Faust wrote and visited libraries and collections around the United States and in Europe, gathering photocopies and microfilm of letters with which they intended to build a comprehensive chronological narrative of their parents' activities, thoughts, and relationships. Their publication project never came to fruition, but the letters collection, heavily augmented by original correspondence that the Hapgood siblings had exchanged with their parents, achieves their greater goal of documenting Hapgood and Boyce's lives, largely presented in their own words.</p>
         <p>Miriam Hapgood DeWitt's extended family is also documented in these papers, particularly her second husband, the Croatian-born husband Vaso Trivanovitch (ca. 1899-1949), and her grandfather Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836-1917), who traveled to Labrador (1857) and extensively around the western United States (1859-1865) and the world (1865-1867). Also included are lecture notes taken by her great-uncle Hutchins Hapgood (1792-1828), who studied medicine at Dartmouth College with Dr. Nathan Smith (1762-1829).</p>

               <p>The series contains correspondence and documents that have almost exclusively to do with Charles Hapgood, Miriam DeWitt, and Beatrix Faust's administration of their parents' papers at the Yale University Library, their various attempts to publish their parents' writings, and files of information they collected about people and topics relative to their parents' lives. The Correspondence subseries has three folders of letters written by the Hapgood siblings to each other, including carbon copies that were distributed to the third when just two were corresponding. The letters are filed in reverse chronological order as they were kept by DeWitt. Some additional earlier letters exchanged between the siblings are filed in Series III.</p>
               <p>Third-party Correspondence is both incoming and outgoing letters sent between the Hapgood siblings and various authors, librarians, and publishers. The subject matter primarily regards other researchers' publication rights and projects, or the Hapgood sisters' own photocopy requests. A set of alphabetical files for specific correspondents is followed by three folders of general correspondence. Within the alphabetical files are three folders documenting the efforts made to publish Neith Boyce's history of Richmond, New Hampshire, titled "A Town in the Forest," and her compilation of Hapgood family letters titled "The Story of an American Family." The manuscripts of both works are not here, but can be found in the Hapgood Family Papers (YCAL MSS 41).</p>
               <p>The general correspondence is filed in reverse chronological order as kept by DeWitt. Perhaps most notable here is a letter from DeWitt to Bernice Kent, dated November 26, 1984, in which she describes her relationship with Ernest Hemingway, and mentions that she had sold in the 1960s the letters he had written her. Transcripts of the Hemingway letters accompany the carbon copy of DeWitt's letter to Kent.</p>
               <p>The Other Papers subseries contains folders of notes made by the sisters while gathering, transcribing, and arranging the copies of letters written by and to their parents, and two boxes of card files related to the project. DeWitt's Subject Files hold reference material on people and places connected to the Hapgoods, primarily photocopies, clippings, etc., with just a few pieces of correspondence. A feature article on Miriam and John DeWitt from the Washington, D.C., <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Evening Star
                  </title> is also filed here.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The Papers subseries contains a variety of material inherited by Miriam DeWitt or copied by her from Beinecke Library's Hapgood Family Papers, Series IV (YCAL MSS 41). Photocopies are distinguished in the folder listing, but the dates shown are those of the original materials regardless if they are photocopies or originals.</p>
               <p>Prominent among the original items in the subseries is a scrapbook kept by Neith Boyce that holds reviews of her books clipped or transcribed from newspapers and periodicals, and a folder of contemporary ephemera related to Hutchins Hapgood that includes printed promotional material for his books and a series of lecture programs he offered, book dust jackets, and newspaper clippings about the 1938 fire that destroyed his cottage in Provincetown. There are four folders of material related to Charles H. Hapgood, brother of Miriam DeWitt. Two contain correspondence: a group of letters that document an extramarital affair between Hapgood and Mary Grand, and a psychoanalytical letter that Hapgood wrote about his parents. Also filed here is a manuscript of Hapgood's early automatic writing and other childhood documents, as well newspaper obituaries on him written by DeWitt.</p>
               <p>Also present are photocopies of Alfred Stieglitz's inscriptions on Hutchins Hapgood's copies of the journal <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Camera Work
                  </title>; the issues were sold at auction by the Hapgood siblings in 1982. Four files hold family genealogical material that was inherited or collected by DeWitt; the Hapgood folder has pages photocopied from <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Hapgood Family
                  </title> (Boston, 1898), however the pages (317-318) in that volume that show the direct line to DeWitt's father are not included.</p>
               <p>The Writings subseries contains a collection of works written by members of the Hapgood family. In addition to literary works by Neith Boyce and Hutchins Hapgood, there are personal items such as a photocopy of a 166-page memoir by Charles Hutchins Hapgood (1836-1917), the father of Hutchins Hapgood. Apparently transcribed (with minor annotations) in 1913, it describes in some detail his sea journey to Labrador (1857) and his schooling and travel in New England (1858-1859), as well as observations made during his extensive travel around the western United States (1859-1865) and around the world (1865-1867); the final sections cover his career and later family life. The earliest item in the collection is also filed here: a small booklet in which Hutchins Hapgood (1792-1828), the great-uncle of Hutchins Hapgood (1869-1944), made careful notes of a set of medical lectures given by Dr. Nathan Smith (1762-1829). Hapgood was an 1813 graduate of Dartmouth College, where he studied with Smith, founder of the medical schools at both Dartmouth and Yale University. Five folders hold three versions of autobiographical essays covering the life of Vaso Trivanovitch (ca. 1899-1949), the second husband of Miriam DeWitt, before he emigrated from Croatia to the United States in 1919.</p>
               <p>Writings by Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce dominate the subseries; they consist mostly of photocopies collected by DeWitt from institutions, notably Beinecke Library, with some print versions and original typescripts filed in; Boyce's story "Odd Jobs" is, for instance, in the latter category and does not appear with the bulk of her original manuscripts in the Hapgood Family Papers (YCAL MSS 41). Also original here is a financial diary kept by Hutchins Hapgood during his time at Harvard University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1892. Beginning on September 24, 1889, it has lists of amounts paid for his books, transportation, laundry, and entertainment, including theatrics and athletics, and covers the months that he studied in Europe, from June 1893 through November 1894. The only narrative in the volume is a short preface that names the theatrical performances he had seen before arriving at college.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains letters written to and by Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce, as collected in photocopies, transcripts, and original manuscripts. The first subseries holds two copies of an undated book proposal made by John DeWitt, the third husband of Miriam Hapgood DeWitt. With a working title of "The Undiscover'd Country," the volume was to be composed of letters written between Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce before the death of their son Harry [called "Boyce"] in the 1918 flu pandemic, and others written afterward between Hapgood and Boyce and their friends, all demonstrating the profound impact that tragedy had on their lives. The proposal is filed in this series rather than in Series II with other family writings because it is primarily correspondence, and may hold transcripts that do not appear in the Letters Collection subseries that follows.</p>
               <p>The second subseries holds the bulk of the DeWitt papers collection, a set of chronologically arranged letters written among Hapgood family members, and between Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce and their circle of friends. Miriam Hapgood DeWitt and her sister Beatrix Hapgood Faust collected the material from libraries around the country, including the Beinecke Library; correspondence related to their efforts can be found in Series I.</p>
               <p>While assembling the collection, the sisters created typed transcriptions of most of the letters, and attempted to assign dates to undated items. In some cases, the sisters were able to give fairly specific dates but in others, they could only approximate a year or time of a year (i.e., "early spring 1916"). At the beginning of the files for many of the years there are folders containing letters to which they assigned approximate dates. Three folders of undated letters and fragments are filed at the end of the subseries; many of these items may be second copies of letters that also appear somewhere within the chronological set.</p>
               <p>In addition to the photocopies of letters they acquired from institutions, the sisters gathered family correspondence from their own homes and relatives, and interfiled these original manuscript letters with the photocopies and transcripts. Many are from Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce to their children, and from the children to their parents; as such, the incidence of original letters increases as the years progress. There are also original letters from the Hapgoods' colleagues and friends; some examples are an otherwise undated 1938 letter from Pauline Hemingway to Neith Boyce, an eight-page letter from Mabel Dodge Luhan to Hutchins Hapgood written from a Taos hospital in September 1942, and two folders of condolence letters received by Boyce after the death of Hutchins Hapgood in November 1944.</p>
               <p>As the sisters had intended, the collection of letters provides a good chronological narrative of the lives, activities, and thoughts of Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce. In addition, it sheds light on the dynamic of their highly creative community, such as in the colorful commentary on the Taos, New Mexico, scene sent back East in several letters by Neith Boyce and Miriam DeWitt while they were visiting Mabel Dodge Luhan during the summer and fall of 1929.</p>

                  <p>Letters with dates narrowed to a month (i.e., "April 1916") are filed at the beginning of the month. Those with span dates (i.e., "April-May 1916" or "1916-1917") are filed where the date range starts. In all cases, if there are typed transcripts, they precede the copies of the manuscript letters.</p>
