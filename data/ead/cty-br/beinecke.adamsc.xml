         <abstract id="aspace_5a5fd17db2e5b87fff7d44a26546045d">The collection consists of material created and collected by Charles Adams in the course of his research and teaching activities as a scholar of Frank Waters and a professor of English at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Material includes correspondence; transcripts and sound recordings of interviews with Waters; sound recordings of various seminars, lectures, and talks about Waters; typescripts of writings by and about Waters; photocopies, reprints, and excerpts of published works by Waters; clippings and other printed material; teaching files; files relating to the Frank Waters Society; and other material. The collection documents Adams's academic career, which focused largely on Waters, and his role as a leading organizer of the scholarly and popular communities interested in Waters, particularly as founder of the Frank Waters Society and editor of Studies in Frank Waters. The collection also sheds light on the nature and organization of the community of interest that sprang up around Waters's work, and provides a great deal of information about Waters in the taped and transcribed interviews conducted by Adams and others.</abstract>

         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, and competing priorities. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections as they are acquired, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received a medium level of processing, which included rehousing all material into acid-free folders and boxes, and organizing material into series according to the creator's different professional activities. A good portion of the material comprising the Writings, Research and Other Material series consisted of loose papers in boxes; when foldering this material, library staff assigned general folder headings based on the contents of the folder. The material comprising the General and Teaching Files series represents files that were created and labeled by the creator, and seem to have been maintained more or less as a group, perhaps in the drawers of a desk or file cabinet, although there was no apparent order to how the files were organized. When refoldering this material, library staff left the grouping of material within files intact, transcribed the file titles, and minimally organized the files so that they are in rough chronological order.</p>

         <head>Charles L. Adams (1929-2008)</head>
         <p>Charles L. Adams was born in Joliet, Illinois, May 11, 1929. He earned his B.A. from Michigan State, his M.A. from the University of Illinois, and his Ph.D. from the University of Oregon. He was a professor of English at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 1960 to 1999.</p>
         <p>Adams's specialty was modern literature, but he was particularly interested in the writings of Frank Waters, the southwestern novelist, essayist, biographer and non-fiction writer. Adams taught a two-semester series of courses on Waters and was a founder of the Frank Waters Society and editor of its annual journal. He edited <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Frank Waters: A Retrospective Anthology
            </title> (Swallow Press/Ohio University Press, 1985) and, with Waters, co-edited <title type="simple" render="italic">
               W.Y. Evans-Wentz's Cuchama and Sacred Mountains
            </title> (Swallow Press/Ohio University Press, 1981). He also published numerous articles on Waters and other literary topics in an assortment of journals. Adams was quoted as saying: "I find it very exciting to be able to work with a living author." Waters spoke in his classes and at UNLV's commencement, and Adams participated in numerous conferences and panels on, about, and with Waters.</p>

               <p>This series consists of files stemming from Adams's teaching and academic activities and relating to his tenure as a Professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. While there is nothing to suggest that Adams's had any sort of filing system per se, these files were foldered and labeled by Adams and seem to be have been kept more or less as a group. Files include university related catalogs and material, class and student papers, general seminar information and records, day calendars, Adams' curriculum vitae and general academic material, especially scattered correspondence and notes.</p>
