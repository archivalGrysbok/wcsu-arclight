The correspondence during his lifetime mainly relates to his work in classics and in radio (there is also some correspondence with friends such as Norman Holmes Pearson); the correspondence after his death deals with his funeral (paid for by his father via his father's lawyer, Winfield E. Aronberg) and the settlement of his estate by his friend, Frank S. Meyer.</abstract>

         <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
         <p>According to information gleaned from correspondence in this collection, most of these materials were in Eugene O'Neill, Jr.'s house at the time of his death. Elsie and Frank S. Meyer, who were friends and neighbors of O'Neill, Jr. in Woodstock, New York, sorted through his belongings and gave some of his papers to his mother, Kathleen Pitt-Smith, some to his Yale classmate and friend, Norman Holmes Pearson, and some to his life-long friend, Lois Williams Bry; in addition, the Meyers themselves kept some of the papers. O'Neill, Jr.'s papers were later reunited when they were given to the library by the Meyers, Pearson, and Pitt-Smith; some of the papers were also purchased from Pitt-Smith. (See also the Lois Williams Bry Collection of Eugene O'Neill, Jr., YCAL MSS 125.) There are also some materials in this collection that were gifts and purchases from other sources. Source information is recorded on each folder.</p>
         <p>The 2001 Addition was the gift of David Zincavage, Eugene B. Myers, and Karen L. Myers, 2001.</p>

         <p>Historically, the Eugene O'Neill Papers at Beinecke were comprised of a number of accessions unrelated by provenance and classified as Za O'Neill. These materials were processed between 1997 and 1998; at that time, they were separated by provenance into four collections: Eugene O'Neill Papers (YCAL MSS 123); Eugene O'Neill Collection (YCAL MSS 124); Agnes Boulton Collection of Eugene O'Neill (YCAL MSS 122); and Eugene O'Neill, Jr. Collection (YCAL MSS 126). The 2001 Addition was formerly classified as Uncat MSS 181.</p>

         <head>EUGENE O'NEILL, JR. (1910-1950)</head>
         <p>Eugene O'Neill, Jr., classicist and son of the dramatist Eugene O'Neill and his first wife, Kathleen Jenkins, was born on 5 May 1910 in New York City. Jenkins and O'Neill had married on 2 October 1909; later that month, O'Neill went to Honduras on a gold prospecting trip. Although he returned to New York in March 1910, O'Neill and Jenkins separated, and O'Neill did not meet his son until a number of years later, when O'Neill, Jr. was eleven or twelve. O'Neill and Jenkins divorced in 1912, and Jenkins was remarried in 1915, to George Pitt-Smith (who already had a son, George, Jr.).</p>
         <p>O'Neill, Jr. attended New York public schools and the Horace Mann School, and received his B.A. from Yale University in 1932. He won many awards while an undergraduate at Yale, including the Winthrop Prize for knowledge of Greek and Latin poetry, the Jacob Cooper Prize in Greek philosophy, the Noyes-Cutter Prize for translating biblical Greek, the Soldiers Memorial Foote Fellowship for classical research (all four years), and the Berkeley scholarship for classical Greek. O'Neill, Jr. was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa and of Skull and Bones, and he served as the Ivy Laureate at his commencement.</p>
         <p>O'Neill, Jr. began his graduate studies at the University of Freiburg, Germany, where he studies classics from 1932 to 1933. While abroad, he also traveled in Iceland, Norway, and the Netherlands. He returned to Yale to complete his studies and received the Ph.D. in 1936. That same year, he was appointed instructor in classics at Yale.</p>
         <p>In 1941, O'Neill, Jr. he rose to the rank of assistant professor. From 1942 to 1943, he took time off from teaching to assist in the war effort. He worked at the Greist Manufacturing Company, an anti-aircraft gun parts factory, and then at the American Steel &amp; Wire Company, and in 1943 was drafted by the army but then rejected because of a childhood injury. That fall, he returned to his post at Yale, spending half of his time in the Department of Classics and the other half teaching English to Navy V-12 students.</p>
         <p>In May 1944, while continuing his full-time teaching at Yale, O'Neill, Jr. also began working full-time as a radio announcer at WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut. That fall, he moved to New York City, taking the semester off from Yale to devote himself to his radio work. He returned to teaching at Yale in the spring of 1945, but he resided in New York City and continued his work in radio. In the summer of 1945, he added to his workload a session of teaching at Sarah Lawrence College.</p>
         <p>In the fall of 1945, O'Neill, Jr. took two years' leave of absence from Yale to devote himself entirely to radio, and in July 1947 ended his association with Yale, though not with teaching. During the academic year of 1947-1948, he taught at Princeton University and at the New School for Social Research. From the fall of 1948 until his death, he taught at the New School and at Fairleigh Dickinson College while continuing his work in radio.</p>
         <p>O'Neill, Jr. was married three times. His first wife was Mary Elizabeth Greene ("Betty"), whom he married on 15 June 1931 while an undergraduate student at Yale. He and Betty were divorced in April 1937, and on 25 May, O'Neill, Jr. married Janet Hunter Longley, who was the daughter of a Yale mathematics professor; they were divorced in the summer of 1938. On 3 July 1939, O'Neill, Jr. married Sally [Hayward?], whose mother, Marjorie F. Hayward, was the curator at the Pardee Morris House in New Haven, Connecticut. During that summer, he and Sally visited Eugene O'Neill and Carlotta Monterey O'Neill at Tao House in California, as well O'Neill, Jr.'s childhood friend, Lois Williams Bry and her family in Ennis, Montana. In April 1944, Sally left O'Neill, Jr. and moved to New York City. He himself moved to New York City in the fall. Four years later, in the summer of 1948, O'Neill, Jr. moved to Woodstock, New York with the art agent Ruth Reade Lander. He increasingly relied on alcohol, and his relationships with others became more difficult. O'Neill, Jr. committed suicide on 25 September 1950 in Woodstock, New York.</p>
         <p>In addition to published articles (on Greek metrics and Greek drama) and reviews, O'Neill, Jr. edited with Whitney J. Oates <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Complete Greek Drama: All the Extant Tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, and the Comedies of Aristophanes and Menander, in a Variety of Translations
            </title>, which was published in 1938. Some of his radio credits include the programs "Invitation to Learning" and the "Author Meets the Critic." He also recorded books for the blind.</p>

There is also correspondence with Barbara Burton (Agnes Boulton's daughter), Mary Elizabeth Greene (O'Neill, Jr.'s first wife), Elsie and Frank S. Meyer (friends and neighbors of O'Neill, Jr. in Woodstock, New York), and Norman Holmes Pearson (O'Neill, Jr.'s Yale classmate and friend). The subseries is arranged alphabetically.</p>
         <p>Correspondence Regarding Eugene O'Neill, Jr.'s Estate relates to O'Neill, Jr.'s funeral and the settlement of his estate. Eugene O'Neill paid for the funeral expenses through his lawyer, Winfield E. Aronberg. Some of the correspondence in this series is between Aronberg and other people (including Pitt-Smith's lawyer, Nathaniel J. Palzer) regarding these expenses. There is also correspondence between Frank S. Meyer and other people about funeral-related expenses and about the disposition of O'Neill, Jr.'s belongings.</p>
