         <abstract id="aspace_064adc08756d15156e89c5f049c87583">The collection documents the life and work of the American writer Zane Grey and his wife Dolly Grey, and to some extent the lives of their children. The papers chiefly consist of correspondence between Zane and Dolly Grey from the time they met until his death, circa 1900-1939. Their letters document Zane Grey's frequent travels throughout the American West and in the South Pacific, his career as a writer, their marriage, and the growth of their family. The collection also includes some correspondence with others; a draft of Zane Grey's autobiography; Dolly Grey's diaries; photographs and ephemera; and ten films. Many of the films apparently document hunting and fishing expeditions, but the collection also includes a print of the 1936 Australian film "White Death," in which Grey was featured as himself, and two documentaries about Zane Grey produced in 1985 by his family.</abstract>

         <head>Zane and Dolly Grey</head>
         <p>Zane Grey, writer of popular adventure stories about the American West, was born Pearl Zane Gray in Zanesville, Ohio, in 1872, to Lewis M. Gray, a dentist, and Josephine Zane Gray. Changing his name to Zane Grey in early adulthood, he studied dentistry at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1896, and started his own practice in New York City. In November 1905 he married Lina Elise Roth, known as Dolly, a graduate of Hunter College. The couple settled in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where they began a family that grew to include three children: Romer (1909-1976), Betty (1912-2007), and Loren (1915-2007). Dolly Grey strongly supported her husband's ambitions to make his living as a writer, helping to edit his work and manage his career as he became increasingly successful. Despite his long absences from home and several acknowledged extramarital affairs, their marriage remained strong and Dolly Grey continued to champion Zane Grey's work following his death of heart failure in 1939.</p>
         <p>Zane Grey's prolific output included best-selling novels such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Riders of the Purple Sage
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Lone Star Ranger,
            </title>and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Under the Tonto Rim,
            </title>many of which were made into equally successful Hollywood films. Grey lived the adventurous life he wrote about, spending months of each year camping in the Arizona desert or fishing off Tahiti and Australia. He was as famous for fishing as he was for writing about it, holding a number of world records including a 1,036-pound tiger shark.</p>
         <p>Dolly Grey died in 1957 at the age of 74 in Altadena, California, where the family had moved circa 1920. She was buried beside her husband in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania. After her death the Grey children continued stewardship of their father's legacy through management of Zane Grey, Inc., formed in 1933 to manage Grey's assets and the rights to his work. In 1931 Betty Zane Grey married Robert W. Carney, with whom she had two daughters; she married George D. Grosso in 1951.</p>
