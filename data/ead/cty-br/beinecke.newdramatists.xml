         <abstract id="aspace_6d75d1bfa113b3f4532e32f9691626bf">The records date from the organization's founding in 1949 and include administrative correspondence, application files, financial and fund-raising records, internal reports, audio recordings and transcripts of guest lectures and craft discussions, audio recordings of board meetings and play readings, photographs, scrapbooks holding clippings about the organization, artwork and production materials for New Dramatists newsletters and publications, and other files related to the group's management and activities, including the ScriptShare program. Prominent in the collection are more than seven hundred play and screenplay scripts which formed a script library at the New Dramatists' office. They include drafts and final scripts by playwrights Robert Anderson, James Baldwin, Sydney Chandler, James Leo Herlihy, Romulus Linney, John McGowan, Lanford Wilson, and John Wolfson, among others, some of which are annotated with production notes. Unique to the collection are a group of whimsical doodles created by theatre celebrities and a set of autographed sign-in boards from the New Dramatists' annual spring luncheons (1980-1996). With the exception of one play script from 1931, the records primarily date from the organization's founding in 1949 through the 1988-1989 season.</abstract>

         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>The New Dramatists Records were inventoried and listed in 2013 with only minimal reorganization of the play scripts in Series I (to incorporate random scripts found in Series II and to establish authors for previously unidentified scripts), and to segregate the audiovisual materials at the end of the collection. Otherwise, the files were left in the order in which they were packed in the New Dramatists offices prior to being transferred to the library with no attempt made to determine which office the files might have come from .</p>
         <p>This collection includes materials previously identified by the following call numbers: Uncat ZA MS 599 and Uncat ZA MS 605</p>

         <head>New Dramatists, Inc.</head>
         <p>New Dramatists, Inc., was founded in New York in 1949 by Michaela O'Harra in association with Howard Lindsay, Richard Rodgers, Russel Crouse, Oscar Hammerstein II, John Golden, Moss Hart, Maxwell Anderson, John Wharton, Robert E. Sherwood and Elmer Rice. The organization has since its beginning awarded seven-year resident fellowships to playwrights enabling them to use dedicated writing and performance spaces to develop their scripts through readings and workshops, with the encouragement and assistance of fellow playwrights, directors, stage managers, professional actors, and the New Dramatists support staff. Among the administrators of the organization were Thomas G. Dunn, director from 1981-1990, and Susan Gregg, director-in-residence and, later, director of script development and marketing.</p>

               <p>The records include administrative correspondence, application files, financial and fund-raising records, internal reports, audio recordings and transcripts of guest lectures and craft discussions, audio recordings of board meetings and play readings, photographs, scrapbooks holding clippings about the organization, artwork and production materials for New Dramatists newsletters and publications, and other files related to the group's management and activities. Audiovisual materials, group of doodles created by theatre celebrities, and a set of autographed sign-in boards from the New Dramatists' annual spring luncheons are filed at the end of the series. The records primarily date from the organization's founding in 1949 through the 1988-1989 season.</p>
