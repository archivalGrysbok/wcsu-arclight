         <abstract id="aspace_b21254de29be4fc1f61a391eeaa7fbdd">The collection consists of correspondence, writings, and personal papers of the American historian and author Paul Leicester Ford. The correspondence is largely professional and documents Ford's work as an editor, historian, bibliographer, novelist and playwright. Ford's correspondents include John Kendrick Bangs, Samuel L. Clemens, Edward Everett Hale, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Rudyard Kipling, and S. Weir Mitchell; earlier letters written to others by James Fennimore Cooper and Jared Sparks are also present. Writings include notes and research materials, most concerning colonial and Federal-period America; drafts; printed versions of published articles; scripts and music for dramatic productions; and publicity for specific works as well as about Ford generally. The novel Janice Meredith and its dramatic adaptation starring Mary Mannering are partiuclarly well represented in the collection; also present is an unfinished historical novel about Elizabeth Chudleigh, Countess of Bristol, along with contemporary printed documentation concerning her trial for bigamy. The collection also contains examples of Ford's work as an editor/printer on his home press, including his genealogy of Noah Webster; a heavily extra-illustrated copy of Websteriana containing autograph manuscript fragments of Webster's dictionary; a genealogy of Gordon L. Ford; and a pamphlet entitled "1814. New London. Pettypaug Point." Some papers documenting the historical research of Worthington C. Ford are present, as well as ephemera from Gordon L. Ford's participation in events commemorating the centenary of Washington's inauguration. The collection also includes photographs and paintings of Ford, including two miniatures; a miniature of "Janice Meredith"; photographs of his parents and siblings; and portrait paintings of Ford's ancestors Noah Webster (by Samuel F. B. Morse) and Rebecca Greenleaf Webster (by Jared Bradley Flagg).</abstract>

         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received some preliminary processing at the time of acquisition. Further organization, rehousing, and description were carried out in 2012. Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below were transcribed from the folders in 2012. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles were supplied by staff during basic processing. This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Paul Leicester Ford (1865-1902)</head>
         <p>American historian and novelist Paul Leicester Ford was born in Brooklyn, New York, one of eight children of lawyer, businessman, and bibliophile Gordon Lester Ford and Emily Ellsworth Fowler Ford, a poet and granddaughter of lexicographer Noah Webster. Due to chronic ill health resulting from a spinal injury in infancy, he received no formal education. He read widely in his father's extensive private library, and made use of his own printing press: at age eleven he edited and printed a genealogy of his ancestor Noah Webster, and at seventeen published a bibliography of Webster. Ford subsequently wrote and edited a large number of books and pamphlets chiefly relating to American history and bibliography, including an edition of Jefferson's writings and biographies of Washington and Franklin. In this work he frequently collaborated with his older brother, the historian Worthington C. Ford; together they published on their home press as the Historical Printing Club. Ford also wrote short fiction, plays, and novels, the most successful of which were <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Honorable Peter Stirling
            </title> (1894) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Janice Meredith
            </title> (1899). He co-edited <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Library Journal
            </title> from 1890 to 1893.</p>
         <p>Ford married Grace Kidder in 1900; they had one daughter, Lesta, who was born June 3, 1902. Paul Leicester Ford was killed by his brother Malcolm on May 8, 1902, in a dispute over family inheritance.</p>

               <p>Other papers consist of clippings, research files, and visual material. Clippings include reviews, publicity materials, and articles documenting Ford's personal life. Research files document Ford's interest in American financial history and Worthington C. Ford's research concerning George Washington, and also include a genealogy of the Ford family, likely printed and extra-illustrated by Ford. The series also includes photographs and drawings of Ford, his family, and his homes, as well as dramatic productions of his works.</p>
