Barrie, postcards, scrapbooks, photographs, and a toy theater version of Peter Pan related to the family of Sir Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch. J. M.

Postcards consist of postcard albums and loose postcards, probably collected by Foy Felicia Quiller-Couch. Postcard correspondents include Bevil and Mabel Quiller-Couch and recipients include Foy Felicia, Bevil, Arthur Thomas, and Lilian Quiller-Couch. Two scrapbooks contain holiday cards, probably collected by Louisa Quiller-Couch, and miscellaneous engravings and clippings, many of which were colored by an unidentified child. Two photographs include a signed portrait of Barrie and an unidentified building.
