         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>The collection is comprised of material formerly classed as: Uncat MSS 13 and Uncat MSS 187. The collection received preliminary processing at the time of acquisition in 1999. Further organization, rehousing, and description were carried out in 2010.</p>
         <p>Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Lawrence &amp; Wishart</head>
         <p>Lawrence &amp; Wishart is an independent British publishing company that was founded in 1936 through the merger of Martin Lawrence, the Communist Party's press, and Wishart Ltd., a family-owned liberal and anti-fascist publisher. During the late 1930s, the press was involved in the political and cultural life of the Popular Front, and published literature, drama, and poetry, as well as political economy, working-class history and the classics of Marxism. From 1936 to 1938, Lawrence &amp; Wishart published New Writing, a biannual literary anthology edited by John Lehmann.</p>
         <p>Lawrence &amp; Wishart has evolved over the years, but continues to publish works that examine the relationship between politics and culture.</p>

         <head>Wishart &amp; Company and Ernest Edward Wishart (1902-1987)</head>
         <p>Ernest Edward Wishart established the publishing house Wishart &amp; Company in the late 1920s. The company published Scrutinies by various writers edited by Edgell Rickford (the first volume appeared in 1928, and the second volume followed in 1931); Sligo (1930) by Jack Butler Yeats; Negro Anthology (1934) edited by Nancy Cunard; and Jews Without Jehovah (1934) by Gerald Kersh.</p>
         <p>Wishart was born in Dulwich, England in 1902, and was educated at Rugby School and Cambridge. In 1927 he married Lorna Garman, the younger sister of his friend Douglas Garman who worked with him at Wishart &amp; Company, and they had two sons, Michael and Luke. Wishart retired from the publishing business in the 1950s and went on to pursue other interests. He died in 1987.</p>
