         <abstract id="aspace_6b9c77e99d4a1b23e59b37fe6a92ab8d">The collection consists of material created and accumulated by Ron Padgett in the course of his work as a poet, translator, and editor. Material includes extensive correspondence with other poets and writers; manuscripts for Padgett's books of poetry, prose, and translations, as well as some juvenilia and early writings; and manuscripts for writings by others. Also included are "bokes," the term coined by Padgett to describe the "little unique editions" Ted Berrigan and he made for each other beginning in the 1960s, which encompass dozens of unique handmade works by Tom Clark, Anne Waldman, Bill Berkson, George Schneeman, Michael Brownstein, Larry Fagin, Tom Veitch, Aram Saroyan, Steve Carey, and Lewis Warsh, among others. Also found are notebooks, including numerous travel diaries, project notebooks, and personal journals; appointment books for the years 1971 to 2002; as well as teaching files; student papers; research material; printed material; and personal papers. The collection also contains files for White Dove Review, edited by Padgett, along with Dick Gallup and Joe Brainard, while they were high school students in Tulsa, and Full Court Press, edited and published by Padgett, Joan Simon, and Anne Waldman from 1974 to 1989.</abstract>

         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>The collection was received by the library in 157 boxes, which were organized and described by the dealer in ten sections, according to where the material originated and/or was stored. Six sections of the dealer list described material stored in Ron Padgett's apartment (in the living room, the closet, or above the bed); three sections described material stored in Manhattan Ministorage; and one section described material originating from Vermont, where Padgett spent summers. Similar types of material (for instance, correspondence and writings) could be found in all ten sections.</p>
         <p>The collection was processed to a preliminary level in 2009 shortly after it was acquired. Preliminary processing included reboxing and refoldering all material, and organizing material at the box-level into series based on activity or format. Material within boxes and folders have not been sorted. Original section and box numbers have been recorded on each folder as part of rehousing so that it's possible to reconstruct the original physical groupings, or sections, of material.</p>
         <p>Information included in the Description of the Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn almost entirely from the dealer description and list. This information has not been verified by the library, and is included in the finding aid in order to provide more detail about the context and content of the collection. In order to compensate for the lack of sorting within boxes and folders, the list of correspondents for each box or file has, when available, been incorporated into the contents list. Names are repeated throughout the finding aid and researchers will have to look in numerous boxes to locate all the correspondence of a particular individual; however, by doing a key word search, it will be possible for researchers to identify where such correspondence is located.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>
