         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and in some instances minimal organization. Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, identified by a unique call number and titled according to month and year of acquisition.</p>
         <p>The finding aid for this collection is compiled from individual preliminary lists for each acquisition that were created at or around the time of receipt by the library. The preliminary lists were migrated to comply with current archival descriptive standards and merged into a single file in 2007-2008. As part of the migration, modifications were made to the formatting of individual lists; however, the content of the lists was neither modified nor verified.</p>
         <p>As a rule, descriptive information found in the Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>Former call numbers: Uncat MSS 109 and Uncat MSS 943.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Ann Lauterbach (1942- )</head>
         <p>American poet Ann Lauterbach was born on September 28, 1942, in New York City to Richard Edward (a war correspondent) and Elisabeth Stuart Wardewell Lauterbach. She graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York City and then obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wisconsin in 1964. She attended Columbia University on a Woodrow Wilson graduate fellowship from 1966 to 1967.</p>
         <p>Following her studies, Lauterbach moved to London, England, where she served as an editor for Thames &amp; Hudson Publishers (1967-1973) and taught at Saint Martin's School of Art (1967-1973). During this time Lauterbach was also director of the literature program at the Institute of Contemporary Art. While living in England Lauterbach published her first book of poetry: <title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title> (Dublin, Ireland: Seafront Press, 1971).</p>
         <p>Lauterbach returned to New York City where she was employed as an art consultant for various galleries (1974-1984) and as the assistant director of the Washburn Gallery (1984-1986). Lauterbach has maintained a career teaching creative writing concurrently with writing and publishing her poetry. She served as a professor of creative writing at various universities, including Brooklyn College (1985-1986), City College, City University of New York, (1989-1998), and the Graduate Center of the University of New York (1993). In 1991 Lauterbach joined the M.F.A. writing faculty at Bard College.</p>
         <p>Her poetry publications include: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Book One
            </title> (Spring Street Press: New York, NY, 1975), <title type="simple" render="italic">

               Or to Begin Again
            </title> (Penguin Books: New York, NY, 2009). Lauterbach also published <title type="simple" render="italic">

               The Night Sky: Writings on the Poetics of Experience
            </title> (Viking: New York, NY, 2005). She has contributed to a number of periodicals including <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <p>The Ann Lauterbach Papers document the personal and professional life of American poet Ann Lauterbach and consist of correspondence, writings, printed material, and audiovisual material.</p>
         <p>Lauterbach's creative life is reflected in her writings and correspondence. The papers contain a number of drafts of Lauterbach's writings from early in her career until roughly 2000. Her correspondence reflects her intellectual circle with correspondents including a number of writers and artists: Stacy Doris, Kenward Gray Elmslie, Richard Hamilton, Susan Howe, Garrett Kalleberg, Ron Padgett, Peter Straub, Marjorie Welish, and Chet Wiener. The papers also contain other authors' manuscripts submitted to Lauterbach for review.</p>
         <p>In addition, the papers relate to Lauterbach's personal life. Included in the papers are journals and yearly planners dating from the 1960s to the 1990s. Lauterbach's correspondence with family members, namely her mother (Elizabeth Lauterbach) and sister (Jennifer Lauterbach), similarly provide insight into her life. The papers also include a journal belonging to her father Richard Lauterbach.</p>
