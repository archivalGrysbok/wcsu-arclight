The Writings series which is made up of Novels, Plays, Essays and Appeals and Other Writings, are written mostly in Yiddish, and includes reviews, playbills, programs, photographs of productions of plays. The correspondence is a selection of letters to Asch from many prominent Jewish writers and organizations. There is a series of letters from Stefan Zweig, as well as a large amount of correspondence with PEN clubs throughout Europe. Asch's concern for the Jews in Europe before and after the second World War is a constant subject in his writings and correspondence. There are also photographs of Asch and his family and friends, clippings of articles about Asch, postcards, and a bust of Asch by Morice Lipsi.</abstract>

         <head>SHOLEM ASCH (1880-1957)</head>
         <p>Sholem Asch, Yiddish novelist, dramatist, essayist, activist and short story writer, was born in Poland in 1880 and emigrated to the United States in 1910. Asch is known both for popularizing Yiddish literature internationally and for the controversy that resulted from the publication of his trilogy, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> (The Nazarene, 1939), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Der Sheliekh
            </title> (The Apostle, 1943), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Meri
            </title> (Mary, 1949). In these works Asch explored the origins of Christianity from a Jewish perspective. Accusations from within the American Jewish community that he was preaching conversion to Christianity prompted a self-imposed exile in 1954 from the United States to Israel. Asch died in London three years later.</p>
         <p>Bernhard Knollenberg, the Librarian of Yale University, asked Asch to donate the manuscript of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> (The Nazarene) to the Yale University Library in 1939. Asch complied, explaining in the introduction to the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catalogue of Hebrew and Yiddish Manuscripts and Books from the Library of Sholem Asch
            </title> (New Haven: Yale University Library, 1945) that the gift of this manuscript to Yale precluded the placement of his manuscripts and books at any other library: "I knew full well that the rest of my manuscripts must come there, too, to the same place where the main product of my life-work is reposing. And where my own manuscripts have found a home, there too must dwell my books." Asch continues, explaining why he chose to grant Knollenberg's request:</p>
         <p>I have sought a home for my collection not in a Jewish</p>
         <p>institution, but in a general American one. I believe it is</p>
         <p>the duty of American Jewry to rebuild the institutions of</p>
         <p>Jewish learning in the new hospitable home which they have</p>
         <p>found.... Jews must also see to it that the spirit of</p>
         <p>Judaism, Jewish learning, should be properly and worthily</p>
         <p>represented in the general temples of knowledge in the land.</p>
         <p>In 1944, through the generosity of Louis M. Rabinowitz, the University Library acquired Asch's collection of manuscripts and books, designating it the Asch-Rabinowitz Collection. This immensely rich library documenting European Jewish life and culture from the 15th through the early 20th century, is well described in the catalogue quoted above, compiled by Dr. Leon Nemoy, Curator of Judaica at Yale. Asch himself provided the summation of the scholarly importance of the his own papers included in the Asch-Rabinowitz Collection, in the catalogue's introduction: "The leaves of my manuscripts represent the days of my life, for I had no other life outside of my works."</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Sholem Asch Papers consist of writings, correspondence, printed material, photographs, and artwork which document the life and work of the Yiddish writer and activist Sholem Asch. The collection spans the years 1907 to 1956, the bulk of the material from 1923 to 1949, during which time Asch wrote all of his major novels.</p>
         <p>The Papers are housed in 23 boxes (18.20 linear feet) and are arranged into four series: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Writings
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Correspondence
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Photographs
            </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Other Papers
            </title>. Boxes 17-23 contain Oversize items. The collection was previously classified as Hebrew Manuscripts +45 and Asch Collection ZA1-ZA6 and Folio 217-218. These old call numbers are either on the items themselves, or have been noted on folders as an aid to researchers who may wish to locate materials previously cited under that numbering system. Transliteration and verification of titles which appear in this listing was provided by Keith Weiser, a student assistant.</p>
         <p>The Sholem Asch Papers contain most of Asch's major works as a novelist, including the extremely controversial <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> (The Nazarene), although it does not contain such earlier works as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Shtetl
            </title>, for which he first became famous as a novelist. Complementing these works are reviews, playbills, programs, photographs of productions of his plays, and a small but revealing body of correspondence as well as several essays and appeals on behalf of European Jewry, all of which provide insight into Asch's character and his role as a spokesman for and activist in the Jewish community, both in the United States and in Europe.</p>

Almost all of the manuscripts are holographs and typescripts in Yiddish. Within each subseries works have been arranged alphabetically by transliterated title. The English translation of the title is also noted.</p>
         <p>The Novels include <title type="simple" render="italic">

               Vos Ikh Gloyb

               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> (The Nazarene) and "Varshe" (Warsaw) in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Dray Shtet
            </title> (Three Cities), and has been noted in the register. There are some typescripts as well, with corrections in Asch's hand. The novels are generally complete, though there are often irregularities with pagination, including large gaps between page numbers, indicating possible missing pages. There are revisions of chapters and excised fragments, and several folders of unidentified fragments. There are also photographs and printed material in this subseries, most of them advertisements and reviews. There are also four essays on the subject of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> (The Nazarene), a scrapbook of reviews for <title type="simple" render="italic">

               Der Man fun Notseres
            </title> by Abraham L. Wolbarst (folder 64). These materials have been placed after the manuscripts they pertain to, in chronological order.</p>
         <p>The Plays, mostly holographs and typescripts written in Yiddish, include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Got fun Nekome
            </title> (God of Vengeance) with an English translation, <title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title> (Rabbi Dr. Silber). Only the first three of these plays are complete. There are four unidentified plays, which may not be complete. There are also photographs and printed material, primarily playbills, programs and reviews. These materials have been placed after the manuscripts they pertain to, in chronological order.</p>
         <p>Essays and Appeals contains several political essays and appeals written before World War II. Many are addressed to government officials and writers in Europe on behalf of European Jews, and Polish Jews in particular. Approximately half of the material in this section consists of holographs in Yiddish, the rest are English typescripts.</p>
         <p>The final subseries, Other Writings, contains a brief autobiography and writings by Asch about his collection of Judaica, two short stories, one of which is unidentified and incomplete, verses in memory of H. D. Nomberg, and unidentified writing fragments. There are also playbills, programs, and reviews related to miscellaneous writings.</p>

In the introduction to the published catalogue, Asch mentions particularly the series of letters from Stefan Zweig, written during Hitler's ascent to power (folder 176). There also are letters to and from librarians at Yale University Library, in particular Bernhard Knollenberg, Acting Librarian James T. Babb and Curator Leon Nemoy, regarding the Asch-Rabinowitz Collection (folders 173-174). Other correspondence between Asch and these three, and chiefly concerning the acquisition of the Asch-Rabinowitz Collection, can be found in the files of the University Librarian in the Manuscripts and Archives Department at Sterling Memorial Library. The series also contains a large amount of correspondence with PEN (Poets, Essayists and Novelists) clubs throughout Europe, numerous invitations and honors from literary organizations, as well as telegrams from friends, colleagues, and business acquaintances congratulating Asch on his fiftieth birthday (folders 177-179).</p>
