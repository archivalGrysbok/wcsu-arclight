         <head>Thomas Leiper Kane (1822-1883)</head>
         <p>Thomas Leiper Kane was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January
27, 1822. He was educated in Philadelphia and, as a young man, traveled to
Europe. For some years, he resided at Paris. After returning to Philadelphia,
Kane studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1846. In that year, Kane
visited Nauvoo and the Mormon camp at Council Bluffs. Although apparently
never a Mormon himself, Kane was sympathetic to the Mormons and became a
friend of Brigham Young. As a result, in 1858, Kane visited Salt Lake City
with special instructions from President Buchanan and was instrumental in
preventing a clash between the army and the Mormons. Kane served with
distinction in the Civil War, retiring in 1863 with the rank of
major-general. After his retirement, Kane resided in Pennsylvania and worked
for a number of charitable causes. He died in Philadelphia in 1883.</p>

The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections [as they are acquired], and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
