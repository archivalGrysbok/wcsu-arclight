         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>As a rule, descriptive information found in the Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Peter E. Palmquist (1936-2003)</head>
         <p>A photographer, collector, and historian of photography, Peter Eric Palmquist was born in Oakland, California on September 23, 1936. In 1944, he moved with his family to Ferndale, California, and he spent most of his life in Humboldt County. During adolescence, Palmquist trained himself in photography. He served in the United States Army as a photographer from 1955 to 1959, mainly with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Paris, France. Palmquist worked briefly as a photographer for the state government of California from 1959 to 1961. From 1961 until his retirement in 1989, Palmquist worked as a staff photographer for Humboldt State University, Arcata, California, where he also graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art in 1965.</p>
         <p>From 1971 until his death, Palmquist collected textual materials and hundreds of thousands of photographic items documenting the practice and occupation of photography from its beginning through the turn of the twenty-first century. He had particular interest in early California photographers, photographers of the American West, and women photographers.</p>
         <p>A self-trained researcher and historian of photography, Palmquist organized more than one hundred exhibitions and wrote more than three hundred articles and a hundred monographs. He was a founding editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Daguerreian Annual,
            </title> and a president of the National Stereoscopic Association.</p>
         <p>Palmquist died January 13, 2003, in Oakland.</p>

      <scopecontent id="aspace_6e56a9f099f95bc6bcdec9b6a9fa6455">
         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Papers and related material documenting Peter Palmquist's roles as a collector and historian of photography, as well as a photographer, 1952-2003. Material includes correspondence, writings, research files, printed material, photographs, audiovisual material, and electronic files.</p>
         <p>The collection, which reflects the order of Palmquist's papers at the time of his death, includes research files on a range of subjects containing material from circa 1848 to 2003, with a focus on photography, especially its role in the history of the American West, particularly in California. The research files also provide rich documentation for the history of Humboldt County, California, the birthplace and primary residence of Palmquist. In most of the research files, the order of the materials reflects the original filing order used by Palmquist.</p>
         <p>Correspondence documents the working relationships between Palmquist and auction houses, filmmakers, gallery owners, geographers, historians, historical societies, libraries, museums, photographers, and publishers related chiefly to the history of photography.</p>
         <p>The papers include examples of academic articles and photographs published by Palmquist, as well as research files and drafts related to his publications and projects, including unrealized efforts. Exhibition material includes preparatory and publicity material, as well as documentation of shows that Palmquist designed or participated in.</p>

                     <p>Research material related to painted panoramas. Popular in the middle of the nineteenth century, panoramic paintings and models became a popular way to represent landscapes and historical events. The painted panoramas influenced the development of photography, in particular the creation of photographic panoramas that show a wide view produced by a panoramic camera or by joining photographs together.</p>
