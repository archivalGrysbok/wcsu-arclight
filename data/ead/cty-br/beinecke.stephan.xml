Correspondence and subject files provide evidence of Stephan's professional and personal relationships as well as her wide-ranging interests, from art to Zen Buddhism. Stephan's creative work consists of drafts, notes, and research files for poetry, historical and autobiographical fiction, anthologies, and film; her research files on Queen Christina of Sweden are extensive. Her travels in and creative work related to Europe, Peru, Japan, China, and India are documented throughout the collection by writings, diaries and engagement calendars, photographs, film, sound recordings, and correspondence. The papers also include a small amount of material documenting the history of the Walgreens drugstore chain.</abstract>

         <head>Ruth Stephan (1910-1974)</head>
         <p>The writer Ruth Stephan (born Charlotte Ruth Walgreen) published her first poems in the late 1930s in venues such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Harper's
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Poetry
            </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Forum
            </title>, and her first volume,<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Prelude to Poetry
            </title>, was published in 1946. With her husband, the painter John Stephan, she founded and edited the influential quarterly magazine <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Tiger's Eye
            </title> (1947-1951), which showcased the work of artists and writers with particular emphasis on abstract expressionism. In addition to further volumes of poetry, her work includes two novels based on the life of Queen Christina of Sweden, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Flight
            </title> (1956) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               My Crown, My Love
            </title> (1960); a volume of translated Quechua stories and songs, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Singing Mountaineers
            </title> (1957); an audio compilation, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Spoken Anthology of American Literature
            </title> (1963); and a documentary film, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Zen in Ryoko-in
            </title> (1971). Her philanthropic work included establishing a poetry center at the University of Arizona in 1960.</p>
         <p>Stephan was born in Chicago on January 21, 1910, the daughter of drugstore founder Charles R. Walgreen and Myrtle Norton Walgreen. She attended Northwestern University but left without a degree in 1929 when she married Justin W. Dart, with whom she had two sons. Unsupported by her family when she began to take herself seriously as a writer, she divorced Dart in 1939. Later that same year she married the painter John Stephan; their only child, a son, was born in 1941. In 1942 the Stephans moved to Westport, Connecticut, where they founded <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Tiger's Eye
            </title> in 1947. This venture lasted until 1951, when the work of producing the magazine threatened to overtake the couple's own creative work. In 1961, Ruth Stephan divorced John Stephan and spent time traveling in Japan and Southeast Asia, where she became interested in Zen Buddhism. In 1966 she married John C. Franklin, a scientist, and lived the remainder of her life in Greenwich, Connecticut. She died in North Salem, New York, on April 9, 1974.</p>

The first subseries, General Correspondence, consists of correspondence filed by name of individual or organization, but also includes files on subjects such as "Birds" and "Race Relations." The second subseries, Subject Files, consists of correspondence and other information filed by subject, with some unsorted correspondence at the end. The final subseries, Family Correspondence, consists of family letters and documents donated by Stephan's son in 2003. Stephan's correspondence with family members can be found in all three suberies.</p>
