         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection includes correspondence, writings, newspaper and journal articles, photographs, and publications relating to Walther Volbach's research and writings on Adolphe Appia.  Included are over sixty typescript essays, articles, and scenarios by Adolphe Appia, many bearing the stamp of the Fondation Adolphe Appia, Geneve.  A typescript of Volbach's translation of many of these writings which was published as <title>
               Adolphe Appia: Essays, Articles, and Scenarios
            </title> in 1989, is included in the collection.  The majority of correspondence consists of letters received by Volbach in the course of his research from Appia's relatives and friends including Appia's cousins Edmond Appia and Blanche Bingham, Appia's pupil and friend Jean Mercier, as well as librarians and fellow researchers, and colleagues with whom Volbach corresponded regarding publications by the American Educational Theatre Association.  One reel of microfilm contains letters to Houston Stewart Chamberlain.  A stage design by Appia for Act I, scene 1 of <title>
               Parsifal
            </title> is the only original design in the collection; however, his designs are represented by copy photographs that were used as illustrations for Volbach's book, <title>

         <head>Adolphe Appia (1862-1928)</head>
         <p>Adolphe François Appia was born in Geneva in 1862, the son of Louis Paul Amédée Appia, a successful surgeon and one of the founders of the Red Cross. While a youth, he became fascinated with the theater, but since his family considered it an inappropriate career choice, he studied music at Geneva, Paris, Leipzig, and Dresden. In 1884 Appia met Houston Stewart Chamberlain and became devoted to the works of Richard Wagner. With the help and encouragement of Chamberlain, he decided to become a designer and stage director.</p>
         <p>Although he received scant recognition during his lifetime, Appia is regarded today as the father of modern stage lighting and design. His reforms of the antiquated nineteenth-century practice of stage design emphasized the significance of time and space, the relation of stage and auditorium, and the contrast of light and shadow. He devoted much of his lifework in particular to creating new productions of the operas of Richard Wagner.  Appia died on February 29, 1928, in a nursing home near Nyon, Switzerland.</p>
         <p>Appia set down his theories on stage set design in two books and several essays, but much of his writing was published only in the 1950s and 1960s. The Fondation Adolphe Appia has as its objective the publication of all his works and the furtherance of his ideas.  For further biographical information, see Walther R. Volbach's <title>

         <head>Walther Volbach (1897-1996)</head>
         <p>Walther Volbach was born in Mainz, Germany in 1897. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Munster in Westphalia in 1920, after completing his dissertation "The Development of Realism on the German Stage." In the 1920s he was an assistant to Max Reinhardt at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, and also worked as a stage director of plays and operas at the State theaters in Stuttgart and Berlin, at the Municipal theaters in Zurich, Danzig and Kiel, and at Vienna's Volkstheater and Volksopera. He also served as an instructor at academies in Berlin, Vienna, and Kiel.  After moving to the United States in the 1930s he taught and directed theater and opera in Ohio, Missouri, and Wisconsin.  He was a professor in the Department of Theatre at Texas Christian University from 1946 until his retirement in 1965.  His publications include <title>
