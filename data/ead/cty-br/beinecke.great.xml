         <head>BERTIE GREATHEED, 1759-1826</head>
         <p>Bertie Greatheed, the son of Samuel Greatheed of Guy's Cliff, MP for Coventry, and Lady Mary Bertie, was born on October 17, 1759. He was raised at Guy's Cliff, and there met the actress Sarah Siddons when she was employed by his mother in 1771-73.</p>
         <p>While living in Florence, Greatheed joined the society "Gli Oziosi" (The Idlers) and contributed to their privately published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Arno Miscellany
            </title> (1784). In 1785 he was one of the major contributors to the Della Cruscan <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Florence Miscellany
            </title>, with Robert Merry, William Parsons, and Mrs. Piozzi.</p>
         <p>In 1788, his blank verse tragedy, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Regent
            </title>, was staged at Drury Lane Theatre, with his friend Sarah Siddons and John Kemble in the lead roles, but the play failed and was withdrawn after only nine nights.</p>
         <p>The Greatheed family was in Paris in 1802-1803, during the Peace of Amiens; Bertie Bertie Greatheed, his son, received permission from Napoleon to draw many of the art treasures which had been brought to the Louvre. The Greatheeds journeyed to Italy in 1804, where Bertie Bertie Greatheed died in October, at Vicenza. His drawings were returned to his father by Napoleon on learning of the son's death.</p>
         <p>Greatheed spent much time and money on improvements to Guy's Cliff, and designed the house's Elizabethan Revival additions and the memorial to the execution of Piers Gaveston on Blacklow Hill. He also acquired a considerable collection of Old Master paintings, including works attributed to Canaletto, Caravaggio, Salvator Rosa, Lely, and Reynolds.</p>
         <p>Greatheed's only child, Bertie Bertie, had married in France before his early death, and in 1823 his daughter Anne Caroline Greatheed married Lord Charles Percy, who took the surname Greatheed Bertie Percy. Bertie Greatheed died at Guy's Cliff on January 16, 1826.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Bertie Greatheed Papers consist of letters, manuscripts and printed material documenting the literary career and friendships of Bertie Greatheed. The papers span the dates 1741-1824 and are organized into three series: I. Letters; II. Manuscripts; III. Printed Material.</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref11">Series I, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                  Letters
               </title> 
            </ref>, is located in Box 1, folders 1-21 and has been arranged alphabetically by author. There are several letters concerning the 1788 production of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Regent
            </title>, including congratulatory notes from relatives and from friends such as Lady Sophia Trevannion Byron and James Robson.</p>
         <p>There are also letters by all of the other major members of the Della Cruscans. Notes by Robert Merry are accompanied by signed drafts of "Ode to Winter," "Address to Bacchus," and "Madness." Letters by William Parsons, located in folders 10-14, also enclose poems, including a draft of "Verses Written on the Island of Staffa." The earliest letters by Parsons, addressed to Greatheed at Eton, are almost entirely comic narratives written in verse. Folder 16 contains letters to Greatheed in Florence by Mrs. Piozzi.</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref65">Series II, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                  Manuscripts
               </title> 
            </ref>, is housed in folders 22-107 and is organized into two subseries: Poems and Prose. Material within each subseries is arranged alphabetically by author and then by title, with material by unidentified authors listed at the end of the subseries. With few exceptions, works are attributed based on docketing or signatures on the manuscripts. Where this is not the case, the author's name appears in brackets in the listing.</p>
         <p>Works by the Della Cruscans Robert Merry and William Parsons are located in folders 44-56. Merry's poems include "To Cloe in England, Written in Florence," and a heavily corrected draft of "A Character." Works by Parsons include an "Epistle from Naples to Bertie Greatheed" and a translation of the opening of Dante's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Inferno
            </title>."</p>
         <p>Poems signed "Ellison" are found in folders 27-36. They include translations from Greek and Latin originals; "A Song of the Bards of Cairbar," probably in imitation of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fingal
            </title>; "The Thoughts of an Evening;" and "Guy's Cliff." Folder 35 contains Ellison's translation of Gray's "O Tu, severi religio loci," another translation of which, by Hugh Hutton, can be found in folder 40.</p>
         <p>Other poems with identifiable authors include Coleridge's "Recantation: A Political Allegory;" "Alonzo the Brave, and the Fair Imogen," by Matthew Lewis; and a poem attributed in the docketing to Thomas Gray, "The University Courtship."</p>
         <p>Poems by unidentified authors are located in folders 62-96 and include epigrams, epitaphs and mock epitaphs, satires, songs, riddles and occasional verses in a variety of hands. Satires include "On a House of Office;" "The Royal Vision;" and "On the Duchess of Leeds Marrying Lord Portmore a Week after the Death of the Duke." Folder 84 contains "On the discovery of the bodies of Henry 8th and Charles 1st;" a "Ditirambo sul caffe" is located in folder 69.</p>
         <p>There are eleven folders of Prose, including an account of prayers offered at a London synagogue for the Prince of Wales in 1788; a description of an avalanche; and a "prophecy," supposed to have been written in 1701, concerning the destruction of the French royal line.</p>

               The Regent
