         <head>JACOB FORNEY (1829?-1865?)</head>
         <p>Born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Jacob Forney was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Utah Territory in 1857 by President James Buchanan. Forney arrived in Utah in the fall of 1857 as federal troops arrived to enforce United States authority over the region. In his letters to the Office of Indian Affairs in Washington, Forney remarked that the Indians in Utah were "in a very unsettled condition" when he arrived, and credited his policy of appeasement and gift distribution as preventing "serious difficulties" (1858 Nov 5).</p>
         <p>Within a few years, however, Forney's actions came under scrutiny by the Office of Indian Affairs. The review occurred as part of a larger investigation by the federal government of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. The Massacre, in which a party of Arkansas emigrants on their way to California were killed, occurred in southern Utah in September 1857, shortly before Forney's arrival in the territory. Investigating the circumstances of the massacre upon his arrival, Forney learned the whereabouts of 17 child survivors; the children had been distributed among Mormon families in the vicinity of the attack. After gathering the children, Forney, assisted by members of the United States Army, returned them to their families in the east.</p>
         <p>Critics-- federal Judge John Cradlebaugh chief among them-- accused Forney of neglecting evidence of Mormon complicity in the Massacre and of financial misconduct. The Office of Indian Affairs began an official investigation into the charges laid against Forney in 1860, and held depositions in Washington as well as hearings in Utah. In mid-1860, Forney was dismissed from his post as Superintendent. Little is known about Forney's life following his dismissal. He is believed to have died in 1865.</p>

         <head>JOHN CRADLEBAUGH (1819-1872)</head>
         <p>Born in Circleville, Ohio, on February 22, 1819, John Cradlebaugh attended Kenyon College and studied law in Oxford, Ohio. After being admitted to the bar in 1840, he was appointed United States associate justice for the district of Utah on June 4, 1858. He arrived in the territory on November 1, and began active prosecution of those responsible for the violence in the region.</p>
         <p>In March of 1859, Cradlebaugh held his first term of court at Provo, convening a grand jury to hear evidence of Mormon criminal activity. The jury failed to indict anyone. Cradlebaugh dismissed the jury and continued the investigation under his authority as sitting magistrate. Accompanied by a small detachment of United States troops and by a deputy marshal, Cradlebaugh visited the southern part of the territory, including Mountain Meadows. During this investigation, Cradlebaugh met Superintendent Forney returning from his own investigation of the site, accompanied by the surviving children of the massacre. The judge and his deputy marshal interviewed Indians and settlers in various encampments until the marshal and troops were recalled under instructions from the Department of War, effectively curtailing Cradlebaugh's investigation of the affair. Based on his observations and other evidence, Cradlebaugh concluded that Forney had abused the powers of his office. In September 1859, Cradlebaugh contacted the Office of Indian Affairs regarding his suspicions. His accusations launched the Office's official investigation into Forney's conduct, and led to Forney's dismissal.</p>
         <p>Cradlebaugh was subsequently appointed to preside over a judicial district that included Carson Valley. He became a key actor in the creation of the Territory of Nevada, and was eventually elected delegate to Congress, serving from 1861 Dec 2 to 1863 Mar 3. During the Civil War, he enlisted as a Colonel in the Union Army. He was wounded at Vicksburg in May 1863, and was honorably discharged from the military in October 1863. He returned to Nevada, and settled in Eureka. He ran unsucessfully for United States Senator, and engaged in the mining industry until his death in 1873. Cradlebaugh was interred in Circleville, Ohio, in 1879.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The United States Office of Indian Affairs Papers Relating to Charges Against Jacob Forney consists of thirty-one manuscript letters, documents and ephemeral filing items, dating from 1858 to 1860. The collection consists primarily of Jacob Forney's and John Cradlebaugh's correspondence with the Office of Indian Affairs, as well as supporting documents that were gathered by the Office during the investigation of Judge Cradlebaugh's accusations against Forney. The collection includes documents and copies of documents created by other individuals, including George W. Armstrong, Indian Agent; B. F. Bell, a former merchant in Utah; David H. Burr of the Salt Lake City firm Hockaday &amp; Burr; F. Dodge, Indian Agent; Jefferson Hunt, early Utah and Nevada legislator; Dr. Garland Hurt, Indian agent; and Kintzing Pritchette, special agent for the Department of Indian Affairs. Most of the documents bear annotations from the Office of Indian Affairs, including short descriptions of the item; these notes appear on the verso of the last page of the item and are the basis for descriptions in this listing. The last page of many of the documents is also marked on the verso with "Special File No. 27", which appears to be the Office of Indian Affairs's internal file number for these materials.</p>

                  Jacob Forney Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref> is arranged chronologically, and primarily contains Forney's official letters and reports, addressed to sucessive Commissioners in the Office of Indian Affairs, Charles E. Mix, Alfred Burton Greenwood, and James William Denver. The correspondence includes an original manuscript of Forney's annual report, dated 1858 Sep 6, giving a description of Forney's activities in Utah from his commission in 1857 until the date of the report. The document, which was printed in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, accompanying the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior for the year 1858
            </title>, 1858, describes the visit of Little Soldier, chief, and Benjamin Simons, sub-chief, both leaders of a group of Shoshoni Indians, and the reaction of Mormon merchants. The report mentions trouble at Spanish Fork related to the Indian farm established under Indian agent Hurt, and makes reference to "the massacre of Arkansas emigrants" and Forney's efforts to establish peaceful relations with local Indians. Forney also notes the recovery of ten child survivors of the massacre. The report is accompanied by six enclosures, consisting of lists and estimates of property at the Spanish Fork Indian settlement and the Sanpete Indian Settlement, as well as a copy of a letter from settlers in Spanish Fork who opposed the Indian farm.</p>
         <p>Forney's remaining correspondence with the Office of Indian Affairs details his official actions from 1858-1859. His letters describe tension between Anglo settlers and Indians, highlighting Forney's attempts to alleviate Indian unrest in the region. Forney's increasingly defensive explanations for his expenditures enclose or are accompanied by certificates and receipts relating to controversial transactions, such as the $10,000 purchase from Hockaday, Burr &amp; Co. in 1858 for "Indian goods" which Judge Cradlebaugh later singled out for investigation. Although most of Forney's financial reports are not present in this collection, the cover letters which originally accompanied them trace Forney's rationale for his management of Indian Affairs in Utah. A single letter to William E. Carter, whom Forney wrote after his removal from the Superintendent post in 1860, details circumstances relating to Forney's dismissal.</p>

                  John Cradlebaugh Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref> consists of Cradlebaugh's letters to the Office of Indian Affairs, accusing Forney of financial fraud, and of conspiring with Mormons to cover up details of the Mountain Meadows Massacre and other atrocities. The correspondence, which is arranged chronologically, includes Cradlebaugh's official written statement against Forney, filed with the Office of Indian Affairs. Other letters detail Cradlebaugh's interest in furthering the investigation, providing the names and localities of witnesses against Supt. Forney, and requesting that testimony be taken in the Territory of Utah.</p>

            </ref> consists of chronologically arranged official materials related to the case against Forney, including a fifteen-page summary report prepared by Kintzing Pritchette of the Department of Indian Affairs in Washington. Pritchette's report, submitted in March 1860, quotes important testimony and depositions. Two supporting documents, an affidavit from Utah Indian agent Garland Hunt, and a statement from B. F. Bell regarding the character of his former clerk, Isaac Neff Henry, are present. Two undated file-related items, a filing band labeled "Testimoney of Defendent" and a manuscript note recording instructions for setting up a special file, "Charges Against Supt. Forney" are filed at the end of the series.</p>
