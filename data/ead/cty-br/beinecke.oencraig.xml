         <head>EDWARD GORDON CRAIG, 1872-1966</head>
         <p>Edward Gordon Craig was born in England on 16 January 1872, the son of the actress Ellen Terry and the architect E. W. (Edward William) Godwin. In 1878, at the age of six, he made his first stage appearance in a production of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Olivia
            </title>, by W. G. Wills. He studied at Southfield Park and Bradfield College, and was a member of Henry Irving's theater company at the Lyceum Theatre in London beginning in 1889.</p>
         <p>In 1893, Craig married May Gibson, and moved from London to Uxbridge. Under the influence of the artists James Ferrier Pryde and William Nicholson, he learned the art of wood-engraving, and began his career as a graphic designer. In 1893 he directed and designed his first stage production: Alfred de Musset's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               On ne badine pas avec l'amour
            </title>. Around this time he also published a magazine, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Page
            </title>, consisting mostly of his own engravings, and in 1899 published a book of woodcuts with accompanying verses entitled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Gordon Craig's Book of Penny Toys
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Craig's career as a stage designer continued to evolve as he collaborated with Martin Shaw in 1901 and 1902 productions of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Dido and Aeneas
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Mask of Love
            </title> and other plays. In 1904 Craig traveled to Berlin to work with the Lessing Theatre, and in 1905 he published his most famous essay, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Art of the Theatre
            </title>, which was later expanded and republished as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               On the Art of the Theatre
            </title>. In Germany he met the dancer Isadora Duncan, with whom he had a brief but intense affair, ending in 1906. Duncan persuaded the theater producer Konstantin Stanislavsky to invite Craig to Moscow, and there he designed an important 1912 production of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Hamlet
            </title>. In 1913, Craig fulfilled a longtime dream by founding his School for the Art of the Theatre in the Arena Goldoni in Florence, however, it closed shortly thereafter at the outbreak of World War I.</p>
         <p>Over his long career Craig became known as an important innovator in theater design, popularizing a modern, minimalist style in contrast to the more extravagant style of his mother's age, and his writings, artwork and design had an enormous impact on twentieth-century theater. His publications include the theatrical periodical <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Mask
            </title> (1908-1929), and the books <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Books and Theatres
            </title> (1925), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Ellen Terry and Her Secret Self
            </title> (1931), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Nothing, or, the Bookplate
            </title> (1924), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Theatre - Advancing
            </title> (1919) and his autobiography, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Index to the Story of My Days
            </title> (1957). He spent the last years of his life in the south of France, and died there in 1966.</p>

         <head>DONALD OENSLAGER, 1902-1975</head>
         <p>Donald Mitchell Oenslager was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on 7 March 1902. After graduating from Harvard in 1923, he spent several years working as an actor, appearing in a 1924 production of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Desire Under the Elms
            </title> at the Greenwich Village Theatre, and working at the Provincetown Playhouse. His first stage design was for a ballet titled <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sooner or Later
            </title> in 1925, and he soon began a prolific career in theater design that spanned the 1920's through the 1960's.</p>
         <p>Oenslager wrote and edited several books on theater design, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scenery Then and Now
            </title> in 1936 and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Notes on Scene Painting
            </title> in 1952, and served as a member of the U.S. National Commission for Unesco and many local and national theater and arts organizations. He also served in the U.S. Air Force from 1942-1945, and from 1925 on he was a member of the faculty of the Yale School of Drama. He cited Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig as the inspirations for his work in theater design, and maintained collections of material related to the two designers, both of which are held by the Beinecke Library at Yale.</p>
