The majority of the collection consists of Gallup's own papers, including personal, professional and editorial correspondence; a small amount of personal papers; research files; and typescripts and galley proofs of many of his publications, including his editions of the journals of Thornton Wilder and several volumes of works by Eugene O'Neill. Correspondents include the authors James Purdy, Sheri Martinelli, and Mary Bernetta Quinn and the Yale librarian James T. Babb. In addition, the collection contains some of the letters and papers by Modernist writers collected by Gallup personally and donated by him to Yale. The most extensive of these groups is the collection of letters by T. S. Eliot in Group X. Recipients include Arnold Bennett, Richard Cobden-Sanderson, Edgar Jepson, Alida Monro and Harold Monro, Brigit Patmore, John Carroll Perkins, and Donald Gallup himself. Publishers' correspondence and book contracts of Carl Van Vechten are found in Group V., while Group VII. and Group VIII. contain copies of articles and ephemera by and related to Ezra Pound and a small amount of Pound correspondence. Diaries by Carlotta Monterey O'Neill are located in Group X. </abstract>

         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections as they are acquired, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and minimal organization in 2009, in 2010, and again in 2014. Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, titled according to month and year of acquisition.</p>
         <p>Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing. Minor inconsistencies in format, punctuation or abbreviation styles in entries have not been normalized.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Donald Clifford Gallup (1913-2000)</head>
         <p>Donald Clifford Gallup (Yale 1934), literary bibliographer, collector, and curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature for thirty years, was born in Sterling, Connecticut and received his B.A. and Ph.D. in English from Yale University. With the exception of a few years at Southern Methodist University and service in the Army during World War II, Gallup spent his entire career at Yale, first as librarian and then as curator of the Yale Collection of American Literature. In that role he was primarily responsible for building Yale's American Modernist collections, acquiring the archives of Mabel Dodge Luhan, Ezra Pound, H.D., Gertrude Stein, Eugene O'Neill, William Carlos Williams, Josephine Herbst, Mina Loy, and Thornton Wilder. Gallup published full bibliographies of T.S. Eliot (1952) and Ezra Pound (1963), as well as numerous editions of works by the authors whose papers he collected. After his retirement from Yale in 1984, he authored two memoirs: Pigeons on the Granite (1988) and What Mad Pursuits (1998). He died in Branford, Connecticut in September 2000 and bequeathed  his papers to the Yale Collection of American Literature.</p>
