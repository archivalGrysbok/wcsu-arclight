         <p>The information in this finding aid derived mainly from word processing files and research files created by Palmquist and his assistants, 1971-2001.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing in 2012-2013, including rehousing and organization. Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>

         <head>Peter E. Palmquist (1936-2003)</head>
         <p>A photographer, collector, and historian of photography, Peter Eric Palmquist was born in Oakland, California on September 23, 1936. In 1944, he moved with his family to Ferndale, California, and he spent most of his life in Humboldt County. During adolescence, Palmquist trained himself in photography. He served in the United States Army as a photographer from 1955 to 1959, mainly with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Paris, France. Palmquist worked briefly as a photographer for the state government of California from 1959 to 1961. From 1961 until his retirement in 1989, Palmquist worked as a staff photographer for Humboldt State University, Arcata, California, where he also graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art in 1965.</p>
         <p>From 1971 until his death, Palmquist collected textual materials and hundreds of thousands of photographic items documenting the practice and occupation of photography from its beginning through the turn of the twenty-first century. He had particular interest in early California photographers, photographers of the American West, and women photographers.</p>
         <p>A self-trained researcher and historian of photography, Palmquist organized more than one hundred exhibitions and wrote more than three hundred articles and a hundred monographs. He was a founding editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Daguerreian Annual
            </title>, and a president of the National Stereoscopic Association.</p>
         <p>Palmquist died January 13, 2003, in Oakland.</p>

                  <p>This subseries chiefly consists of tintypes and wet collodion processes, as well as material related to their production.</p>
                  <p>Wet collodion processes use a collodion binder on material, which a photographer must coat, expose, and develop before the collodion dries. Wet collodion processes include ambrotypes, melainotypes, and tintypes, although photographers also used the process on cloth and paper.</p>
                  <p>Tintypes are a wet collodion process that produces a direct positive image on a thin sheet of lacquered metal, usually iron.</p>
                  <p>Tintypes come in many sizes. Manufacturers produced the metal used to produce tintypes and sold it to the photographer or photography studio. The photographer used the full plate to make a large photograph, or usually cut the plate to make multiple smaller photographs. As a result, most tintypes have irregular cuts including crooked edges and clipped corners.</p>

                  <p>This subseries includes photograph buttons, which represent photographs mounted on a button mechanism that a wearer may temporarily fasten to the surface of a garment using a safety pin, or a pin formed from wire, a clutch, or other mechanism.</p>
                  <p>Photograph buttons evolved with photography, and early forms include daguerreotypes and tintypes. These buttons became particularly popular between 1900 and 1930, when customers supplied a photograph to a manufacturer, who reproduced it as a photograph button.</p>
