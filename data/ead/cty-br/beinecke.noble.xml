         <head>David Grant Noble (born 1939)</head>
         <p>David Grant Noble (Yale 1961) was born and raised in rural Massachusetts. He majored in French at Yale University, and began photographing seriously in 1962 while serving in army counterintelligence in Vietnam. During the 1960s, he lived in New York City and wrote articles and photographed for the weekly newspaper, Manhattan East. In 1971, Noble moved to New Mexico. Initially, he worked as the record photographer for archaeological excavations by the School of American Research at Arroyo Hondo Pueblo near Santa Fe; he continued to work for the school until 1989. In 2003, Noble received the Victor Stoner Award from the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society in recognition of his "outstanding efforts to bring historical and archaeological awareness of the Southwest to the general public." In 2011, he received the Emil Haury Award from the Western National Parks Association for "outstanding contributions in scientific research or other activities that advance the understanding and interpretation of the natural and cultural resources of western national parks."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "Ancestral Pueblo Indians, part of the Kayenta-Anasazi branch, began construction of Betatakin ("Ledge House" in Navajo) in the mid-1200s but lived in the village for less than a decade before moving on. A five-hundred foot-high natural rock amphitheater has protected the site so effectively that some roofs and ceilings remain intact. Richard Wetherill and Byron Cummings, who first recorded this cliff dwelling in 1907, found an abundance of artifacts untouched for centuries. Navajos, who moved into the region after the Pueblos had departed, stayed away from places like Betatakin believing them to be haunted."</p>

The Canyonlands area of southeastern Utah contains many examples pictographs of anthropomorphic figures in the Barrier Canyon Style which have a ghostlike or otherworldly appearance and appear to float between rock and air, between one world and another. They may have small heads, vestigial or no limbs, and torsos containing designs and animal figures. They can be life-size or smaller in scale and sometimes are accompanied by animal or bird figures, perhaps showing the shaman's spirit leaving his human body."</p>

Since it dates to the late 1200s, a time when the Four Comers region was being depopulated, it may have been built by migrants.

                  <p>Noble: "This panel of elongated, reddish-painted anthropomorphic figures are part of the Buckhorn Wash Site located in a rugged area of eastern Utah known as the San Rafael Swell. The precise date of this and other nearby rock art sites has been hard to determine, but scholars estimate that they are between 1,500 and 3,000 years old. Fremont people inhabited the region after around 500 CE. The Buckhorn Wash pictographs closely resemble Archaic-period imagery found not far to the south in Barrier (Horseshoe) Canyon. In historic times, passers-by heavily vandalized this artwork; fortunately, in the 1990s local citizens raised funds to have it professionally restored."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "These impressive broad-shouldered and elaborately decorated anthropomorphic figures are typical of the Classic Vernal Style of Fremont rock art. They are believed to represent shamans or possibly the supernatural beings envisioned by shamans during trance states. Fremont people lived in the Dry Fork Canyon region after around 650 CE. Archaeologists have found clay figurines in caves that are similar in style to these petroglyphs."</p>

Aviculture, especially the breeding of macaws, flourished here too. The city declined in the 1400s, and by the time Spaniards explored the valley, its once impressive buildings lay in ruins."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "In the eastern Galisteo Basin of New Mexico, petroglyphs of the Horned Serpent often are depicted as a thick graceful snake form with forward-curving horn and dog-like snout. It is interpreted as representing the Pueblo deity Awanyu, guardian of springs and god of underworld water and has been traced in rock art far to the south. Polly Schaafsma, author of Rock Art of New Mexico, sees an analog in the Mexican Quetzalcoatl. This example is accompanied by a shield figure and face mask and dates to sometime between 1300 and 1700 CE."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "One of the most extensive collections of rock art in New Mexico is associated with the remains of San Cristobal Pueblo, located on a private ranch in New Mexico's eastern Galisteo Basin. San Cristobal Pueblo was inhabited by Tano Pueblo Indians until the outbreak of the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, when they occupied Santa Fe. Their descendants presently live on First Mesa, on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona. This bird form is one of thousands of examples of bird, animal, reptile, plant, and human figures."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "For millennia, the Rio Grande Valley has been a source of sustenance for human beings as well as for animals and birds. Native Americans wove large nets with which to catch water fowl, especially during molting season. Today, many species of migratory birds – especially snow geese, sandhill cranes, and ducks – winter in the marshes of the Bosque del Apache, near present-day Socorro, New Mexico. Until soon after the arrival of Europeans in the region, Tiwa Pueblo Indians lived in the vicinity. Their economy included hunting, gathering plants, farming, and trading with their neighbors."</p>

                  <p>Noble: "Crack-in-Rock Pueblo lies northwest of Flagstaff in Wupatki National Monument. Its inhabitants were northern Sinagua Indians whose culture first appeared in the late seventh century on the eastern slopes of the San Francisco Mountains. Sometime around 1150, the Sinagua increased in population – immigration from the Kayenta region probably contributed to the growth – and they began building stonemasonry pueblos like Crack-in-Rock in and around the Wupatki Basin. The architecture of these monumental structures may well have been inspired by that of the ancestral Pueblo Indians (Anasazi) to the north and east."</p>

This rock art probably dates to the late prehistoric period and into early historic times.

This example has a checkered neckband and dots on its body, which some researchers believe stand for corn kernels and raindrops.
