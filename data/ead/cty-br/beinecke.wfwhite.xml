         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>The Correspondence and Writings series were originally processed in 1973. At that time a finding aid was created for the Correspondence and individual catalogue cards were created for the Writings. The finding aid, created using a typewriter, was later converted to an electronic file by means of scanning and Optical Character Recognition software, and encoded in EAD.</p>
         <p>The finding aid was further updated in 1999 and 2008. A group of unprocessed correspondence was found and interfiled with existing correspondence in 1999. In 2008 additional series were added to the collection and more correspondence was integrated into the existing Correspondence series. At that time the following series were added: Writings, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Other Papers, and Photographs. The Writings series reflects the original catalogue cards and an index to the original call numbers is located in Appendix A. The subseries "Third-Party Correspondence", which provided cross-references to letters physically contained in either the Walter White Correspondence or Poppy Cannon Correspondence series, was deleted and replaced with notes indicating where the material is physically situated in the Correspondence Series. Photographs donated by Poppy Cannon were removed from "Photographs of Blacks" (JWJ Zan5 + 2) and returned to the Papers. The title of the collection was changed in order to reflect its entire contents from "Walter Francis White and Poppy Cannon Correspondence" to "Walter Francis White and Poppy Cannon Papers." The call number was also changed from JWJ White to JWJ Mss 38.</p>

         <head>WALTER FRANCIS WHITE, 1893-1955</head>
         <p>Walter White was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 1, 1893. He was one of the seven children (he had five sisters and one brother) of George White, a Post Office employee, and his wife Madeline Harrison White. He completed high school in 1912 and entered Atlanta University, from which he graduated in 1916. While an undergraduate he had a variety of part-time jobs and was at one time a hotel porter. He later became an insurance salesman for the black-owned, Atlanta-based Standard Life Insurance Company. After graduation, White became a full-time clerk with that company. White was an active and energetic member of the Atlanta branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (N.A.A.C.P.), which he served as secretary. Through his work for that organization he became acquainted with James Weldon Johnson, then Field Secretary and National Organizer for the Association. It was on Johnson's recommendation and at his urging that White consented to become one of the Associate Secretaries of the N.A.A.C.P. He served in this capacity from 1918 to 1929. White married one of the Association's office secretaries, Leah Gladys Powell, in 1922. During the twenties White became famous for his first-hand investigations of lynching, which he conducted by posing as a white man. He also published two novels,<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fire in the Flint
            </title> (1924) and<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Flight
            </title> (1926), and an exposé of lynching,<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Rope and Faggot, A Biography of Judge Lynch
            </title> (1928).</p>
         <p>When James Weldon Johnson left the N.A.A.C.P., Walter White was made acting Secretary. With Johnson's final resignation, White succeeded to the permanent position in 1931. During his tenure as Secretary, from 1929 to 1955, White led the campaign against the confirmation of John J. Parker to the Supreme Court, directed the Association's activities in the Scottsboro case, and directed activities designed to thwart communist influence in the organization. He also consolidated the powers of the Secretary by exercising strong personal control over the national staff. From 1943 to 1945 White served as a war correspondent for the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Post
            </title>. He visited most of the major war areas and as a result of his experiences wrote<title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Rising Wind
            </title> (1945). Later he expanded his public writings by producing an editorial column for several newspapers, including the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Chicago Defender
            </title>. In 1948 he published his autobiography,<title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Man Called White
            </title>.</p>
         <p>The years 1949 and 1950 were very active years for White. It was at this time that he carried out his plans to divorce Gladys Powell and marry Poppy Cannon, a white woman. Just prior to his marriage, he submitted his resignation to the N.A.A.C.P., but his letter of resignation was filed without being acted upon, though he was granted a year's leave of absence. There may have been a connection between his impending marriage and his attempted resignation, as he had kept his marriage plans a secret from the Association. Later White withdrew his resignation. While on leave of absence White married, participated in the 'Round the World Town Hall Meeting, and entered on an extensive lecture tour. During his leave there were two developments within the Association that were to face White on his return. The first was a feeling that the communists had again gained an undue influence in some branches of the Association. The second internal difficulty involved White himself. Many members of the local branches and of the national staff felt that White exercised too much power, and there was an attempt to oust him. Though he thwarted this attempt and retained the secretaryship, the office was stripped of some of its power. During the last five years of his life White increased those of his activities not related to the N.A.A.C.P. and the field of race relations. He became particularly interested in Haiti and the Caribbean, and sometimes acted as an unofficial spokesman for the interests of that area. White was likewise active on behalf of India and interested himself in its economic and political development. He cultivated the friendship of "Nan" Pandit, Nehru's sister, and made arrangements for Nehru to meet black leaders when he visited the United States. During the 1950's White was in declining health as the result of a heart ailment. He died of a heart attack on March 21, 1955.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Walter White and Poppy Cannon Papers document the careers and lives of Walter White and Poppy Cannon and span the dates 1910 to 1956. The Papers contain correspondence, writings, other papers, and photographs relating to Walter White's career as the Secretary for the N.A.A.C.P. and as a writer and to Poppy Cannon's career as an editor, writer, and publicity consultant.</p>
         <p>Walter White's work for the N.A.A.C.P. and, more broadly, the development of the N.A.A.C.P. during his tenure, are recorded in the Papers. This includes, for example, the N.A.A.C.P.'s handling of the Scottsboro case, investigation of lynchings, response to communism, and increased legal action against discrimination.</p>
         <p>The Papers also concern White's work outside of the N.A.A.C.P. including his writing career, lecture tours, and international work (most notably on behalf of the Republic of Haiti and India). Correspondence, research materials, drafts, publicity, and reviews document these activities and provide insight into White's creative process. As the Papers illustrate, White's writings range from journalism to prose, poetry, and non-fiction.</p>
         <p>Poppy Cannon's career is also recorded in the Papers. In addition to material relating to her writings as a journalist, editor, and publicity consultant, the Papers also document Cannon's collaboration with White on various writing projects as well as her memoir of White (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Gentle Knight
            </title>).</p>
         <p>Walter White's and Poppy Cannon's professional and personal relationships with writers, publishers, friends and family are recorded in their correspondence. Correspondents include Josephine Baker, Mary McLeod Bethune, Dumarsais Estime, Oscar and Dorothy Hammerstein, William H. Hastie, John Haynes Holmes, James Weldon Johnson, Bill ("Bojangles") Robinson, Franklin D. and Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Algernon Black, Norman Cousins, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, J. Waties Waring, and Roy Wilkins.</p>
         <p>In addition the Papers provide insight into White's and Cannon's personal relationship, including courtship and marriage, and their experience as an interracial couple.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>The Walter Francis White correspondence in this collection includes his general personal correspondence, family correspondence, and letters addressed jointly to Walter Francis White and Poppy Cannon (between the years 1917 and 1955). The correspondence consists essentially of personal letters, but many letters deal directly or indirectly with matters relating to the work of the N.A.A.C.P. The individuals with whom White corresponded in each period of his life, and the subjects with which the letters are concerned, reflect the changing circumstances of his life. Though not arranged this way, the material may be said to fall generally into the following groupings:</p>
                  <p>1. 1917-1948</p>
                  <p>The letters in the collection that fall within these dates comprise only a small fraction of what must have been White's total correspondence in this period. There are some originals, but many of the letters are typewritten copies. Much of the correspondence for this period relates to the N.A.A.C.P., and touches on but does not cover in depth, White's first appointment to the staff of the Association, communist infiltration of the Association, the Scottsboro case, and lynchings. The correspondence between Poppy Cannon and Walter White in this period deals with their collaboration on a play, blacks in motion pictures, colonization, White's and Poppy Cannon's personal plans, and his relation with the N.A.A.C.P.</p>
                  <p>2. 1949-1950</p>
                  <p>The correspondence falling within these dates is the heaviest concentration of letters in the series. This segment of correspondence corresponds approximately with White's leave of absence from the N.A.A.C.P. White's activities in this period included his divorce and remarriage, his newspaper column and articles, his lecture trips, the 'Round the World Town Hall Meeting', and his reaction to the attempt to oust him from the secretaryship of the N.A.A.C.P.</p>
                  <p>3. 1950-1955</p>
                  <p>The correspondence falling within these dates is concerned with White's activities and interests outside of the N.A.A.C.P. These included his interests in the Republic of Haiti as well as the general Caribbean area and his interests in and activities on behalf of India, particularly his scheme for industrial development of the sub-continent.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>The correspondence of Poppy Cannon is organized under two headings: General Correspondence and Letters of Condolence. Letters addressed jointly to Poppy Cannon and Walter White are filed with the Walter White Correspondence.</p>
                  <p>In general, the material may be said to fall into the following groupings:</p>
                  <p>1. 1945-1950</p>
                  <p>The correspondence falling within these dates is almost exclusively that of Walter White with Poppy Cannon. It includes much during 1948-1949 on their marriage and personal plans, but it also covers other subjects, such as collaboration on a play, blacks in motion pictures, the N.A.A.C.P., and White's activities and relations with the Association.</p>
                  <p>2. 1951-1954</p>
                  <p>The correspondence falling within these dates is the most general in character, covering a variety of Poppy Cannon's interests. Subjects touched upon in this grouping include cooking, public relations work for Haiti, and the personal and public activities in which she and White were involved. The correspondence between White and Poppy Cannon in this section is small.</p>
                  <p>3. 1955-1956</p>
                  <p>The correspondence falling within these dates generally relates to the publication arrangements for Walter White's last book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                        How Far The Promised Land
                     </title>, and Poppy Cannon's memoir of White, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                        A Gentle Knight
                     </title>.</p>
