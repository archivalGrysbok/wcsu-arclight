         <abstract id="aspace_0bc0a4d76046e8a0f91b5dae83515627">The papers provide insight into the lives and careers of Michael De Lisio, poet and sculptor, and Irving Drutman, a journalist and editor. The papers contain drafts, research notes, and printed versions of De Lisio and Drutman's writings. Correspondence with various authors, artists, and performers, including Peter Bull, Janet Flanner, Lillian Gish, Ira Gershwin, and Lotte Lenya, also sheds light into their professional lives. De Lisio and Drutman's artwork, including De Lisio's sculptures of Ezra Pound and Marianne Moore, and several paintings by Drutman, are part of the papers. De Lisio's career as a sculptor can also be traced in his subject files, exhibition catalogues, and other printed material. Evidence of De Lisio and Drutman's relationship and personal lives can be found in their correspondence, personal papers, and photographs.</abstract>

         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and in some instances minimal organization.</p>
         <p>The finding aid for this collection is compiled from a preliminary list that was created at or around the time of receipt by the library. The preliminary list was migrated to comply with current archival descriptive standards. As part of the migration, modifications were made to the formatting of the list; however, the content of the list was neither modified nor verified.</p>
         <p>As a rule, descriptive information found in the Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>This collection includes materials previously identified by the following call number: Uncat Mss 500.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>
