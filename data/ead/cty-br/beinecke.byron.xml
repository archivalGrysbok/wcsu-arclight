         <head>Robert Byron (1905-1941)</head>
         <p>Robert Byron, writer and art critic, was born in London and educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford University. Byron was the first of three children born to Eric Byron, a civil engineer, and Margaret Robinson Byron, an amateur artist. Byron made a career out of writing about his extensive travels and his first book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Europe in the Looking-Glass
            </title> (1926), is based on his travels to Germany, Italy, and Greece while still an undergraduate student. Byron's later travels to Greece (1926, 1927, and 1931), and fascination with Byzantine art, were also inspiration for his books <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Station
            </title> (1928), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Byzantine Achievement
            </title> (1929), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Birth of Western Painting
            </title> (1931).</p>
         <p>In 1929 Byron flew to India for the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Daily Express
            </title> in order to write a series of articles on the Indian air mail. Once in India, Byron continued his travels throughout the region (including a stint in Tibet) which he wrote about in articles as well as in his book <title type="simple" render="italic">
               An Essay on India
            </title> (1931). Byron later recounted his travels in Tibet following a trip to Russia (1932) in his book <title type="simple" render="italic">
               First Russia, Then Tibet
            </title> (1933).</p>
         <p>In 1933 and 1934 Byron traveled to the Middle East, spending time largely in Persia and Afghanistan, but also passing through Cyprus, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq. These travels resulted in Byron's best known book: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Road to Oxiana
            </title> (1937). Byron collaborated with Christopher Sykes to publish the novel <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Innocence and Design
            </title> (1935) under the pseudonym "Richard Waughburton" in which they drew on their experiences in Persia (now Iran). Byron also wrote an essay, "Timurid Architecture", for Arthur Upham Pope's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Survey of Persian Art
            </title> (1938) based on his observations of Persian architecture. On his return to England Byron worked on two travel books on the British Isles: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Shell Guide to Wiltshire
            </title> (1935) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Imperial Pilgrimage
            </title> (1937). Byron continued traveling after his trip to the Middle East, including trips to America, Russia, Siberia, China, and Japan, reporting on his experiences in newspapers and journals.</p>
         <p>Byron wrote on art and architecture in both his travel narratives and in other projects (such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Appreciation of Architecture
            </title> published in 1927). He was also a founding member of the Georgian Group, which was established in 1937 as an offshoot of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.</p>
         <p>In the late thirties and early forties Byron's chief preoccupation was with Nazism and World War II. While Byron's pursuit of a position with the military was unsuccessful, he found outlets for political action in the Federal Union League and with the Ministry of Information. In 1938 Byron secured contract work with the Ministry of Information as a propagandist, for which he traveled to Germany and attended the Parteitag (the Nazi Party Congress). On his return to Britain the project ended and Byron ultimately joined the European News Department of the BBC. In 1940 Byron again became involved with government wartime endeavors and, under the guise of a <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Times
            </title> correspondent, he was sent to Iran in order to observe Russian activity regarding Middle East oil. Byron died on his way to the Middle East on February 24, 1941 when the ship he was on was torpedoed.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Robert Byron Papers document his work as a writer and art critic and span the dates 1866 to 2005 (predominantly dating between 1909 and 1941). The Papers contain correspondence, writings, personal papers, photographs, and drawings documenting Byron's personal and professional life. The Papers document Byron's engagement with travel, art history, history, and politics.</p>
         <p>Papers such as research materials, drafts, publicity, and reviews provide evidence of Byron's writing career and creative process. Byron's travels, on which he wrote extensively, are documented in the Papers, and include observations on Greece, Afghanistan, Persia, India, Russia, Tibet, and China. Byron's journals and correspondence (particularly with his mother) record his initial observations while traveling and were a source for his publications. As an amateur photographer and artist Byron also created photographs and drawings while abroad, many of which he later used as illustrations in his publications.</p>
         <p>In addition to documenting his travels, Byron's correspondence also provides evidence of his literary circle as well as relationships with editors and publishers. Among his correspondents are Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, John Betjeman, Arthur Upham Pope, and Edith Sitwell, and to a lesser extent, Somerset Maugham, George Bernard Shaw, Rebecca West, and Leonard Woolf. The Papers also record Byron's social circle, many of whom he became acquainted with while at Eton and Oxford, including Michael and Desmond Parsons, Bryan Guinness, and Christopher Sykes.</p>
         <p>Byron's interest in politics (and particularly with Nazism and World War II) are documented in his reports on propaganda as well as papers relating to his involvement with the Federal Union League and as a journalist with the European News Department of the BBC.</p>
         <p>In addition to his writings, Byron's other papers also provide evidence of his dedication to art and architecture, such as his involvement with the Georgian Group (which includes meeting minutes and drafts of related articles and lectures).</p>

               <p>The series contains Byron's personal and professional correspondence dating from 1920 to 1941 and correspondence from third parties to Byron's parents and sister dating from 1900 to 1991. The series documents Byron's personal relationships and writing career. Family Correspondence contains correspondence exchanged between Byron and his immediate family (namely his parents and sisters), Byron's correspondence with extended family members, and third-party correspondence sent to Byron's parents and sisters (such as letters to Eric Byron and Lucy Butler addressing the legacy of Byron's papers). Byron's correspondence with his mother is particularly helpful in understanding his writing process because he drew from these letters in his publications (such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Road to Oxiana
                  </title>).</p>
               <p>Byron's friendships and relationships with editors and publishers are documented in General correspondence. Additional correspondence can be found in Writings (Series II) and Other Papers (Series III).</p>
