         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and in some instances minimal organization. Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, identified by a unique call number and titled according to month and year of acquisition.</p>
         <p>Material within this collection has been organized by acquisition reflecting the fact that the collection has been acquired in increments over time. Researchers should note that material within each acquisition overlaps with and/or relates to material found in other acquisitions. In order to locate all relevant material within this collection, researchers will need to consult each acquisition described in the Collection Contents section.</p>
         <p>Researchers should also note that similar material can be arranged differently in each acquisition, depending on how the material was organized when it was received by the library.</p>
         <p>As a rule, descriptive information found in the Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>The abbreviations ABC (American Ballet Company), AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Artists), BAM (Brooklyn Academy of Music), and NYSCA (New York State Council on the Arts) are used within the Collection Contents list.</p>
         <p>Inventory numbers (# "number") assigned by Llewis Lloyd have been retained in the descriptions.</p>
         <p>Before coming to the Beinecke Library, the papers were on deposit at the Harvard Theatre Collection.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>
