         <head>John D. McDonald (1906-1998)</head>
         <p>John Dennis McDonald, a writer, editor, business historian, fisherman, and horse racing enthusiast, was born on December 5, 1906, in Detroit, Michigan. His father, John E. McDonald (1870-1944), a native of Ontario, Canada, was a builder and a pharmacist in the West Village neighborhood on Detroit's near east side, and it was there that John D. and his sister Katherine (1905-1986) were raised. Their mother, Katherine Brown (1872-1953), was a school teacher in Canada before immigrating to Detroit in the 1890s and marrying in 1903; the McDonald's first-born, Helen, died at birth.</p>
         <p>After attending public schools in Detroit, and briefly (1918-1920) in Santa Monica, California, John McDonald studied the physical sciences at the University of Detroit (1924-1926). Moving on to the University of Michigan, he completed an AB degree in 1928, and, while working as a registered pharmacist and manager of the family's McDonald Drug Company in Detroit, earned an MA from the university in 1931; both of his degrees were in literature. McDonald's first marriage was to Lorraine Oven (1907-1995), a classmate from Detroit; their daughter Joan was born in 1929, and the couple separated immediately afterward. He met his second wife, the painter Dorothy Eisner (1906-1984), in the fall of 1935; they were married on November 7, 1936, and their daughter Christie was born in 1942. Eisner, a New York native who lived and worked in the Greenwich Village section of the city, was a childhood friend of the writer Tess Slesinger (1905-1945), the first wife of the leftist journalist Herbert Solow (1903-1964).</p>
         <p>John McDonald's literary career began after he moved to New York City in the summer of 1932. In his first years in the city McDonald made two good friends whose influences would come to bear directly on his professional and personal lives: Herbert Solow, with whom he would collaborate on political projects and would eventually become a co-worker at <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> magazine; and Dan Bailey (1904-1982), who quit the New York academic scene to become a renowned fisherman and fly-tier in Montana. McDonald was introduced to fly-fishing in the streams of New York's Catskill Mountains by Bailey, and as the sport became a life-long passion, his interest widened to encompass angling history.</p>
         <p>Once in New York, McDonald became involved with radical political groups such as the Communist League of America and the League of Professional Groups for Foster and Ford, the latter a collection of writers, artists, educators, and others supporting the Communist Party candidates in the 1932 federal election. Other activities in his freelance years (1932-1939) included a research project with the noted historian Louis Morton Hacker (1899-1987) and work for the New York State Department of Social Welfare. In September 1936 McDonald was hired as an assistant editor in the Washington office of the Federal Writers' Project of the government's Works Progress Administration. In February 1937 he began to coordinate local activities for the New York-based American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky, a group of American liberals and intellectuals who supported the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials (also known as the Dewey Commission after its chairman, John Dewey). The commissioners were to hold their hearing with Trotsky in Mexico in mid-April 1937, but a committee of technical volunteers, primarily writers organized under Herbert Solow's direction, went ahead to assist the exiled revolutionary with tasks ranging from translating and preparing legal documents to purchasing and delivering his food (to avoid potential poisoning by Stalinist agents). In mid-March, McDonald resigned from the WPA and, accompanied by Dorothy Eisner, drove to Coyoacán (now part of Mexico City) where he served on Trotsky's secretarial staff, and Eisner painted portraits of Trotsky and the trial room. McDonald and Eisner returned to the states at the end of April, and he continued with his freelance writing, including the essays he wrote, and co-wrote with Dan Bailey, on fly-fishing.</p>
         <p>In 1939 McDonald was hired by the American Film Center, an agency that the Rockefeller Foundation had established in 1938 and funded through its closing in 1948. The AFC's director was Donald Slesinger (1897-1977); its function was to provide advice and support for documentary film makers and for the distribution of educational and public-interest films. By April 1940, McDonald was editing the AFC's mimeographed newsletter which he soon developed into <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Film News
            </title>, a substantial illustrated monthly. He remained at the center until 1945 when he joined the magazine <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> as a staff writer and an associate editor. McDonald was elected to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title>'s board of editors in 1949, and retired from the company in 1971.</p>
         <p>While at <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title>, McDonald, by his own admission, turned out over one hundred articles and edited countless others. His specialty was the strategic aspect of American business, which encompassed economic theory and game theory, but his early writings on fishing, "Fly Fishing and Trout Flies" (May 1946) and "Atlantic Salmon" and "The Leaper" (June 1948), were probably his most popular and certainly his most colorful productions. Positive public reaction to those, and to the four articles he wrote for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sports Illustrated
            </title> (appearing between the magazine's August 1954 inaugural issue and 1958), inspired his three scholarly books on fishing history: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Complete Fly Fisherman: the notes and letters of Theodore Gordon
            </title> (Scribners, 1947; reissued by Theodore Gordon Flyfishers in 1970, Nick Lyon's Books in 1989, and Easton Press in 1995); <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Origins of Angling
            </title> (Doubleday, 1963; reissued by Lyons &amp; Burford and Easton Press in 1997); and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Quill Gordon
            </title> (Knopf, 1972). The first and third titles introduced twentieth-century readers to Theodore Gordon (1854-1915), the legendary but forgotten scholar-fisherman of the Catskills, now acknowledged as the father of the American school of dry-fly fishing. The second centers on the fifteenth-century fisherwoman Juliana Berners, and was expanded from his <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sports Illustrated
            </title> articles. His work on these projects engendered friendships with a number of leading British and American fishermen and fishing historians, including Alfred W. Miller (1892-1983), a New York public relations executive who published under the pseudonym Sparse Grey Hackle.</p>
         <p>A interest in gambling, particularly in card games and horse racing, led to McDonald's work in game theory. It began with his research for a <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> article on poker ("Poker: An American Game," March 1948) and continued in "A Theory of Strategy" (June 1949); both relied upon the writings of the Princeton economists Oskar Morgenstern (1902-1977) and John Von Neumann (1903-1957), the leading minds in game theory. The articles were followed by a book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Strategy in Poker, Business and War
            </title> (Norton, 1950; reissued in 1963, 1989, and 1996, and in a Japanese edition), which McDonald once described as an interpretation of Von Neumann and Morgenstern's landmark volume, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
            </title> (1944). Both men assisted him with various projects over the years, and Morgenstern continued to advise McDonald in the decades following Von Neumann's death. As with the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> article, the poker book was illustrated by his friend, the Connecticut artist Robert Chesley Osborn (1904-1994). Research for two other <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> pieces, "How Businessmen Make Decisions" (August 1954) and "The Business Decision Game" (March 1958), inspired McDonald to continue and expand upon his game theory work with academics. With their help, he designed an intensive survey centered on strategic decision-making practices with which he interviewed executives at leading American corporations; armed with the resulting data, he composed <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Game of Business
            </title> (Doubleday, 1975; reissued in 1977; also in German, Japanese, and Russian editions). Perhaps McDonald's least-known project is William S. Paley's autobiography, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               As It Happened: a Memoir
            </title> (Doubleday, 1979), in which he is credited with the selection and organization of material, research guidance, and editorial insight.</p>
         <p>The work for which John McDonald is best known, and which was a constant presence throughout the last fifty years of his life, is the management classic, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               My Years with General Motors
            </title>, by Alfred P. Sloan Jr. (Doubleday, 1964; reissued in 1972 and 1990; with editions published in China, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as recorded for the blind, between 1963 and 2004). John McDonald's relationship with the giant automobile corporation began in 1949 when he interviewed Sloan (1875-1966), its board chairman and former chief executive, for a <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> feature on the Sherman Antitrust Act. Afterward the pair planned out and began to co-author a series of articles on general management principles; that assignment eventually grew into a memoir covering Sloan's fifty-year career in the automobile business and his contribution to the principles and practices of industrial organization. McDonald took a leave of absence from the magazine and, aided by research associate Catharine Stevens (1925-1997), and with his friend the photographer Walker Evans (1903-1975) as picture editor, worked full time on the book from 1954 to 1959. While he officially received credit as the project's editor, McDonald was in fact responsible for most of the text, and was therefore in a position to file a lawsuit against General Motors when, fearing the contents would open the potential for antitrust litigation, it ordered the manuscript suppressed. After several years of legal parrying, the corporation relented and the book was released in 1964 (serialized first in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title>, beginning in October 1963). It immediately became required reading for business and management faculty and students as well as those in the industry, a status it has since maintained. For many years afterward, McDonald was encouraged by friends to write a book on his legal struggle with General Motors. He had kept all of his research and project files, as well as copious notes documenting the meetings and telephone phone conversations with the corporation's attorneys, during the decade-long process of creating the Sloan book. McDonald began working in earnest on a manuscript while in his mid-eighties, and his final literary work, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Ghost's Memoir: the Making of Alfred P. Sloan's My Years with General Motors
            </title> (MIT Press, 2002), was published nearly four years after his death at age 92 on December 23, 1998.</p>
         <p>With the exception of residing in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, from 1942 to1945, John McDonald and Dorothy Eisner lived and worked in New York City after their marriage. Eisner generally spent her summers painting in rural settings that included upstate New York (1937-1942), Cape Breton, Nova Scotia (1947), Livingston, Montana (1949-1958), and from 1960, on Cranberry Island off the coast of Maine. Cranberry Island was also a favorite place for McDonald, and he continued to spend time there in the years following Eisner's death on April 28, 1984.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The John McDonald Papers consist of correspondence, manuscripts, and research materials related to McDonald's published writings on the practice and history of American business, management, game theory, and fishing. Also in the collection are files of his personal correspondence, and a few papers documenting his political, social, and professional involvements, including his work with during the 1940s with the American Film Center and earlier, with the American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky and the Dewey Commission. The bulk of the collection concerns McDonald's published writings, particularly his nine books on strategic business practices and fishing history as well as many of his <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Fortune
            </title> magazine articles, and his unfinished works in fiction and non-fiction. The files contain personal and business correspondence, research material, notes, contracts, drafts, tear sheets, reviews, and fan mail, and a set of diary-like "logbooks," but little in the way of visual materials.</p>
         <p>While the papers contain good documentation for most topics related to McDonald's life and writing projects, there are fewer records for the years before 1945. As he wrote in a note to the files dated 1976, "Most of my records prior to 1936 were lost, some in 1932-33 to fire and vandalism in my absence." In addition, McDonald was primarily involved in freelance work through 1940 and changed residences frequently; in his later years he moved regularly between the New York metropolitan area and Cranberry Island, Maine.</p>
         <p>The John McDonald papers are an important resource for studying the organization and management of American corporations, and the history and theory of economics, game theory, and fishing. Though McDonald's associations with radical politics are not as well documented, when viewed in tandem with materials in the Beinecke Library's Dorothy Eisner Papers and his correspondence with the academics Alan Wald and Archie Hobson, the papers provide a small but valuable window on the literary left and their pre-World War II political activities in New York and Mexico City.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains correspondence files and personal papers which mostly relate to McDonald's personal and family life. The correspondence files are in much the same arrangement as they were when received by the library. Family Correspondence contains letters from McDonald's parents, sister, and in-laws, as well as letters sent between John McDonald and Dorothy Eisner and between the couple and their two daughters. General Correspondence is arranged under two headings, Alphabetical and Chronological. The first holds folders for people with whom McDonald had kept individual files or had a working relationship that extended into his personal life (such as Dan Seligman, Catharine Stevens, Herbert and Sylvia Salmi Solow), fishing friends (Sid Neff and the Bailey family), notable personalities (Whittaker Chambers, Eleanor Clark, and Robert Penn Warren), and academics interested in McDonald's life experiences (Archie Hobson and Alan Wald). Also filed here are more than sixty letters from the artist John C. McPherson, the husband of the painter Sarah Freedman McPherson; the McPhersons were friends from Greenwich Village and spent their summers on Maine's Monhegan Island.</p>
               <p>The General Correspondence Chronological files contain a wide variety of letters, holiday and birthday cards, and postcards that McDonald received from friends, colleagues and, after 1960, his daughters, son-in-law, and grandchildren. Here multiple letters can be found from some of McDonald's closest friends, including the New York lawyer H. William Fitelson (1905-1994) and his wife Anita Morrow (1910-1998), who were associates from the 1930s. Other correspondents include authors John T. Hill, Carl Little, Isabelle Storey, and Ruth Freeman Swain; artists Sheena Calvert, Mary McConnell, and Rivka Schoenfeld; and long-time friends Barbara Mullen, Annette Nyffeler, and Anne-Marie Nyffeler-Boschenstein.</p>
               <p>Additional correspondence, especially that concerning McDonald's writing projects, can be found in Series II, Writings, including runs of correspondence with Oskar Morgenstern, John Von Neumann, and Alfred P. Sloan Jr. Series III, Other Papers, contains correspondence files related to McDonald's work on behalf of the Dewey Commission and for the American Film Center.</p>
               <p>McDonald's Personal Papers contain a variety of documents, including his resumes and autobiographical statements; random financial, insurance, medical, and real estate papers; travel files; wall calendars; material surrounding the Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism, bestowed on McDonald by the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1976; and documents related to his and Dorothy Eisner's deaths. Also in this series are six years of records of the Heart Club of New York City, to which McDonald was elected a member in 1951. The all-male social club, founded in 1934, met every few weeks to dine, drink, play cards, and compete for trophies and prizes. McDonald was elected to membership in the Century Club in 1968; correspondence related to activities with that organization can be found throughout the General Correspondence chronological files in this series.</p>
               <p>Correspondence regarding McDonald's writings and publications is filed in Series II and III. That which documents his work with Leon Trotsky and the American Film Center is filed in Series III.</p>

               <p>The series contains correspondence and research files supporting McDonald's writing projects, as well as contracts, drafts, tear sheets, reviews, and fan mail pertaining to his work.</p>
               <p>The Articles subseries holds files covering McDonald's research and writings for the magazines <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Nation
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     New York
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Rod and Reel
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Sports Illustrated
                  </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Town and Country
                  </title>. Material in his books generally had appeared previously in his writings for periodicals, particularly for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title>, so some of these files have direct intellectual connections to the research and correspondence files in the Books subseries, and vice-versa.</p>
               <p>The subseries primarily contains files from McDonald's twenty-six-year career at <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title>, including correspondence files and internal memoranda related to the magazine's administrative matters. McDonald kept separate correspondence folders for two men, the Princeton economists Oskar Morgenstern and John Von Neumann, perhaps because their relationships spanned so many of his projects. The general correspondence is a chronologically arranged set of single letters on a variety of topics; in many cases carbon copies of McDonald's replies are on file. Also here are the records of the "Fortune Jockey Club," a syndicate of investors (McDonald, fellow <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title> staff members, friends, and family) who purchased a racehorse in 1949. Included are photographs of the filly, Water Kelpie, who ran during the summer of 1950 and was sold by the group that fall.</p>
               <p>Most of the files, however, cover McDonald's writings for the magazine, and include topic-related correspondence, research notes, and drafts, as well as fan mail and newspaper articles that reported on his <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title> articles. Also filed here are several versions of lists recording McDonald's writings and editorial work for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title>, which have particular value as his contributions did not always appear under a byline. He kept a small selection of tear sheets and loose covers from the magazine, most dating between 1945 and 1955. Notes and lists found with the papers indicate that some of the pages may be part a set of articles pulled together by his Sloan-project associate Catharine Stevens as a 1957 Christmas gift. Full issues of the magazine exist for March 1946, March 1948 (with its original mailing carton), February 1953, August 1957, and September 1963. The latter contains the first installment of the six-part series on Alfred P. Sloan Jr. and General Motors, afterward published as Sloan's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     My Years with General Motors
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>There are files for four articles that McDonald wrote for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Sports Illustrated
                  </title> between 1954 and 1957, including one which appeared in the magazine's August 1954 inaugural issue. McDonald's two 1957 articles on the fifteenth-century fisherwoman Juliana Berners, co-written with Cornell University professor Dwight A. Webster, were later expanded for McDonald's 1964 volume <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Origins of Angling
                  </title>. The earliest published work by McDonald in the collection is a short piece on trout fishing that appeared in the May 1939 issue of <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Town and Country
                  </title>. Additional early writings on fishing, some co-authored with his friend Dan Bailey, can be found in Series III, Other Papers.</p>
               <p>The Books subseries holds documentation on nine books McDonald wrote, co-wrote, or contributed to. The files hold correspondence, contracts, research material, drafts, reviews, royalties statements, and fan mail. As many of his books evolved from his magazine writings, readers should also check the Articles subseries for research materials that might precede those filed in the Books subseries. The largest amount of documentation exists for three projects, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Game of Business
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     A Ghost's Memoir
                  </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     My Years with General Motors
                  </title>, with smaller groups of files for the other six: <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     As It Happened
                  </title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Complete Fly Fisherman
                  </title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fisherman's Bounty
                  </title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Origins of Angling
                  </title>; <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Quill Gordon
                  </title>; and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Strategy in Poker, Business and War
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>A major resource for McDonald's book <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Game of Business
                  </title> was a 1968 survey he made of the chief executives of thirty American corporations. The interviews were conducted using a questionnaire on strategic decision-making that he had developed with the assistance of noted academics in the field of game theory at Cornell, New York, Princeton, and Yale universities among others, as well as staff members at the Rand Corporation. The files for those consultations are present in the collection; the notes folders contain McDonald's records of conversations (many of which were afterward typed up) and collected research material. Folders of raw data from McDonald's interviews with the executives follow the academic research files.</p>
               <p>McDonald's files on his writings on General Motors (GM) are divided between his two major works on the topic: the book he wrote with Alfred P. Sloan Jr. (<title type="simple" render="italic">
                     My Years with General Motors
                  </title>, 1964) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     A Ghost's Memoir
                  </title> (published posthumously in 2002), the book about the suppression of the book he wrote with Sloan. In preparing the latter, McDonald pulled many primary documents from his project files for the former, and relied upon them to tell his story of the administrative and legal battles he fought to see the Sloan book published. Readers interested in the preparation of the earlier Sloan work will need to consult the files for both projects. The extensive research files for the 1964 Sloan book include correspondence with (and between) Sloan and GM executives, notes on interviews held and GM records reviewed, copies of GM internal records, and chronologically arranged rounds of manuscript drafts circulated to Sloan, GM executives, and others for comment. Folders holding the drafts retain the titles assigned by McDonald, who had kept many of the texts in hand-labeled spring-clasp binders. Filed at the end is McDonald's annotated copy of the published volume, which he inscribed "Work copy #2."</p>
               <p>When compiling material for his <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     A Ghost's Memoir
                  </title> (begun under the working title "Mr. Sloan"), McDonald organized his notes, correspondence, and documents in a series of chronologically arranged manila envelopes, many of which he annotated with explanatory notes, additional facts, and editorial comments. The envelopes held papers dating from the 1950s and 1960s that he had supplemented with new research and draft texts from the 1970s through the 1990s. McDonald's order has been maintained, with the material filed under the year of the earliest items in the folder; his manila envelopes were retained with their contents when his annotations were more than simply a list of the enclosures. Of particular interest here are McDonald's comprehensive notes of meetings he held with Sloan, as well as those with GM executives and their legal representatives, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Also here are files holding letters between McDonald and Sloan that span their entire relationship, most of which discusses their contractual agreements regarding McDonald's employment, salary, and royalties from sales of the 1964 book.</p>
               <p>
                  <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Strategy in Poker, Business and War
                  </title> (1950) had its genesis in two articles he published in <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title> on poker (March 1948) and strategy (June 1949); readers interested in this book should also consult material on the two articles and correspondence with Oskar Morgenstern and John Von Neumann filed in the Series II subseries Articles, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>The Other Writings subseries contains material for books and articles that were either works of personal interest or short-term contract jobs; the bulk of the papers document projects that McDonald thought about and never published. The files are arranged under the headings of Fiction and Non-Fiction, and primarily contain research, notes, and correspondence, with only a few drafts of texts. Fiction writings include plans for two unpublished works for children, "Pelican" and "Puffin;" the former was begun in 1941 and revived by McDonald some fifty years later. The majority of the files, however, are for two proposed book-length projects, "Detroit" (non-fiction) and "Hairpin," (fiction) with two smaller groups for novels whose notes McDonald marked, "Story A" and "Epi." McDonald's extensive material for "Hairpin" (sometimes labeled as "Hairpins") consists of loose pages, pads, and notebooks of random notes, thoughts, and quotations, in addition to two actual hairpins; many of the notes appear to relate to his relationship with the artist Rivka Schoenfeld.</p>
               <p>McDonald's literary ruminations on his native city of Detroit spanned five decades. In the late-1930s he had sketched a number of narrative outlines, and had researched and written essay-length drafts of what he termed "a biography of Detroit," into which he intended to weave stories of industrialists, workers, trade union leaders, socialists, and politicians drawn from his experiences in New York. When he took up the project again in the mid-1980s, he focused more on his own childhood memories and ancestors, primarily the McDonald and Perrin families, and the West Village neighborhood in which he grew up; on a "work in progress: 1985-1987" resume, McDonald described the book as "Biography-autobiography: The Twenties and Thirties with extensions back into the 19th Century and forward to the 1980s." The files that he had labeled as "Detroit" contain correspondence with librarians, archivists, church historians, genealogists, and McDonald relatives in the Midwest, Florida, and Canada, as well as maps, photographs, research notes, clippings, photocopies, and a few drafts of text.</p>
               <p>Readers interested in any of McDonald's unpublished works should also consult the chronological run of Logs/Notebooks/Daily Notes held in Series III, many of which may contain further and random notes, sketches, and ideas for these unfinished writing projects.</p>

               <p>The series contains papers related to McDonald's personal projects and employment prior to his career at <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Fortune
                  </title> magazine, and reference material related to his interests; it includes his files on the Moscow Trials and the American Film Center, his Logs/Notebooks/Daily Notes, and a collection of printed Books, Pamphlets, and Serials related to his work in business, fishing, politics, and labor history. The subseries American Committee for the Defense of Leon Trotsky documents McDonald's involvement with the Dewey Commission and other radical activities. It contains John McDonald and Dorothy Eisner's correspondence with Leon Trotsky, which includes three letters from Trotsky. The American Film Center subseries consists of his office correspondence and two bound sets of <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Film News
                  </title>, the serial he edited. The Logs/Notebooks/Daily Notes subseries contains a run of chronologically organized spiral-bound notebooks and other loose sheets of paper dated between 1979 and 1997, which functioned for McDonald somewhat like commonplace books: he made lists of tasks to be done, wrote down random thoughts, and occasionally made almost diary-like descriptions of his daily activities; a single folder holding similar material from the mid-1950s was also filed here. Subject Files contains random clippings and notes on topics and people of interest to McDonald, in both his personal and professional lives.</p>
               <p>The last subseries holds copies of printed works used by McDonald for research or personal interest; most are also available in other Yale University Library collections, although many of the copies here were annotated by McDonald. Any academic papers and offprints on business topics were left the Series II research files with correspondence from the authors. The literature filed here covers business, fishing, labor and politics, and Detroit history. In addition to the titles listed, the political literature contains copies of pamphlets and serials published by the Workers Party of the United States and other socialist and communist organizations. The final section, Other Literature, holds copies of three state guides prepared under the Federal Writers' Project of the Work Projects Administration, where he served briefly as an editor.</p>
