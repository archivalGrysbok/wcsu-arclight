Writings are autograph manuscripts of poetry and prose compositions on linguistics, geology, and geography, including several drafts of his Report on the Geology of Connecticut, as well as chemistry notes by West Point professor James Cutbush. Percival's notebooks contain writings and notes on a broad range of topics in addition to his classroom notes from school, college, and medical school days. Personal papers include contracts, agreements, and subscriber lists related to his publications; inventories and invoices documenting his large library collection; and other financial papers, primarily bills for personal expenses including room, board, and clothing. Correspondence files hold letters to and from many prominent colleagues and scholars such as Benjamin Silliman and Edward C. Herrick in New Haven, friends including George Hayward in Boston, his publishers Sidney Babcock, Samuel G. Goodrich, and Samuel Walker, and editors such as Eliza Leslie and Louisa C. Tuthill. Percival was a member of the New Haven Sing-Song Club and the collection documents his contributions to that organization. Also present is a portrait painting of Percival by his brother Edwin Percival, and a group of papers regarding Percival's life and work complied by J. H. Ward, Herbert E. Gregory, and others, including a memoir of him by Caroline Howard Gilman.</abstract>

         <head>James Gates Percival (1795-1856)</head>
         <p>James Gates Percival, an American poet, physician, linguist, geologist, bibliophile, and autodidact, was born in Kensington, Connecticut, on September 15, 1795. After attending boarding school he entered Yale College in 1810 and graduated in 1815. Percival began medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1818 but returned to Yale to complete his degree in 1820. He practiced medicine in Connecticut and Charleston, South Carolina, and briefly taught chemistry at West Point in 1824. Returning to Connecticut, he studied linguistics and European languages (particularly German), assisted Noah Webster with his <title type="simple" render="italic">
               American Dictionary of the English Language
            </title> (1828), and prepared new editions of Vicesimus Knox's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Elegant Extracts
            </title> (1826) and Conrad Malte-Brun's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A System of Universal Geography
            </title> (1834). His former Yale professor and mentor Benjamin Silliman encouraged Percival's appointment as Connecticut state geologist in 1835, which led to his amassing great quantities of geological data that were eventually published in his volume <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Report on the Geology of the State of Connecticut
            </title> (1842). Hired to survey lead mines in Illinois and Wisconsin in 1853, Percival spent his last years in the Midwest, becoming the state geologist of Wisconsin in 1854; he died in Hazel Green, Wisconsin, on May 2, 1856.</p>
         <p>Percival began writing poetry while in boarding school, his most notable work being the epic-length poem "The Commerciad"; later verses were published in the early 1820s in the New Haven <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Microscope
            </title>, the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               United States Literary Gazette
            </title>, and other newspapers. His collected <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Poems
            </title> (1821) included his well-regarded "Prometheus" and inspired the publication of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Prometheus Part II with Other Poems
            </title> (1822). His series <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Clio I
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Clio II
            </title>(both 1822), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Clio III
            </title> (1827) were followed fifteen years later by his final volume of poetry, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Dream of a Day
            </title> (1843).</p>

               <p>The series holds many of Percival's financial papers documenting his payments for room, board, clothing, laundry, and other expenses, including his agreement with the General Hospital Society of Connecticut, where Percival lived from 1843 through 1851. Prominent among the papers are records related to his large collection of books: almost one hundred leaves of book inventories, more than twenty leaves of organizational schemes for the volumes, over eighty receipts from booksellers in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and New Haven between 1819 and 1841, and insurance papers covering the collection. Also here are agreements regarding his publications, and a few general financial records. Other records for his publications and library are in Series II, Box 7, folder 140.</p>

               <p>Series VI primarily contains twenty-two hand-drawn maps in ink, graphite, and crayon on paper; several of the maps were annotated on their versos by Percival's biographer J. H. Ward. The nineteen maps of Connecticut record in minute detail data on the geology of the state, and may have been created for Percival's work <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Report on the Geology of the State of Connecticut
                  </title> (1842) or his <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Geological Reports on the Middletown Silver-lead mines, Middletown, Connecticut
                  </title> (1853). Another map is labeled on its verso "Trap and Sandstone of New Jersey" and is likely related to material in Box 3, folder 94 (Report on the Trap and sandstone of New Jersey).</p>
               <p>The remaining two maps are of foreign lands: Scotland and northern Europe. The former was previously misidentified by the library as a map of Pennsylvania, probably due to the initials "Pa" (meaning parish) after each place name inscribed on it. The latter portrays parts of countries in northern Europe including Holland, France, Denmark, Germany, Prussia, and Austria. It may have been prepared for Percival's 1834 edition of Malte-Brun's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     System of Universal Geography
                  </title>; it was inscribed on the verso by Ward: Documents showing Percival's studies, but of no quotable or practical value J. H. W.</p>
               <p>Also here is a portrait painting of Percival by his brother Edwin Percival. He was born in Kensington, Connecticut, in 1793, studied art in Hartford, Connecticut, and died in greatly reduced circumstances in Troy, New York, about 1847.</p>
