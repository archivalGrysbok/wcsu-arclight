         <p>There are four letters from Whitman, one each to E. S. Marsh and John Swinton, and two to unidentified individuals. There are three photographs of Whitman, several printed reproductions of photographs, and a colored version of the Samuel Hollyer engraving that served as the frontispiece in the first edition (1855) of <title type="simple" render="italic">

               </title> 
            </ref>, is organized into three subseries: Correspondence, Writings of Walt Whitman, and Other Papers.</p>
         <p>The correspondence is subdivided for Letters to Whitman and Other Correspondence. Letters to Whitman consists of 14 letters from Civil War soldiers and former patients dating from 1865-1870. Most letters are brief, "a few lines," written to inform Whitman of the correspondent's health and whereabouts. Some mention Whitman's work and mutual friends, express interest in meeting, and seek favors, including help in obtaining work. Other Correspondence consists of third-party correspondence, with one letter, from H. F. to Elmira Crossman, in Whitman's hand.</p>
         <p>The Writings subseries includes several galley proofs for individual articles and poems, some inscribed and signed by Whitman, as well as an untitled holograph manuscript on writing, a holograph note titled "Incidents for Soldiers in the Ranks," and holograph fragments of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               November Boughs
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Other Papers contains two groups of papers, one concerning Whitman's brother George and one concerning New York Civil War regiments. The papers relating to George Whitman, dating from 1864-65, include journal entries and letters documenting Whitman's efforts to determine the health and location of his brother during the war. Whitman's journal entries provide a rough history of his brother's movements. There is an undated memo from George Whitman, enclosed with a "Feb. 19th, 1865" letter from Captain William Cook to Louisa Whitman, in which he reveals his captivity in Virginia and reassures his family that he is "in tip top health and spirits." Whitman's first journal entry, dated December 26, 1864, describes the family's experience after receiving George's army trunk, which appears to have been shipped home after George went missing or was taken prisoner. Whitman writes, "It stood some hours before we felt inclined to open it." The papers concerning New York Civil War regiments include newspaper clippings, holograph notes, and two notebooks on the 51st New York Veterans.</p>

Third-party Correspondence includes letters from Edward Dowden, H. Buxton Forman, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Horace Traubel, and John Townsend Trowbridge.</p>
         <p>The Writings subseries, housed in box 3, consists chiefly of work by Whitman.

         <p>The Correspondence subseries is organized into three subvidisions: Letters from Walt Whitman, Letters to Walt Whitman, and Third-Party Correspondence. There are letters from Whitman to George Routledge, William James Linton, and others. Whitman's letters are of a business nature. His letter to Routledge, for example, confirms an agreement for "$50 in gold" for use of an unnamed poem. Other correspondents include Karl Knortz.</p>
         <p>Writings includes work by Whitman and others. There are holograph manuscripts for a poem, "Sea-Captains, Young or Old," and an untitled autobiographical statement.
