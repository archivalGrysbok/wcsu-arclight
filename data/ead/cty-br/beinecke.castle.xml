         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection consists of 106 volumes, dating from c. 1550 to 1770 (with one volume containing items from as late as 1848). Five numbers in the sequence (10, 23, 59, 69, and 77) are missing, and two additional numbers (50a and 98a) have been added. Seven numbers are multi-volume sets. The collection totals 119 volumes in all. Most of the volumes are collections of short manuscripts and printed documents pertaining to a variety of topics. Over 2,000 items are present, about 1,550 in manuscript and roughly 500 in print. All of the documents are on paper and are bound in contemporary vellum. While most of the manuscript documents are written in an italic cursive, a few examples of broad humanist script are present in the collection. A fair number of engravings, woodcuts, ink drawings, and watercolors supplement the text documents.</p>
         <p>The entire Italian Castle Archive was donated to Yale by H. P. Kraus, with the exception of volume 98a, which was purchased from Kraus in 1991. The earlier provenance of the Archive is unknown, although the frequent mention of Naples and the D'Aste family leads one to believe that the compilation of the Archive was completed in Southern Italy in the mid to late eighteenth century. Supporting this claim are frequent references to Ancona (where Cardinal Marcello D'Aste was Archbishop in the early 18th century) and Switzerland (where Marcello D'Aste served as Papal Nuncio from 1692-1695). Another member of the family, Donato Antonio D'Aste (d. 1743), was a famous legal scholar who resided in Naples. However, the wide array of documents and the lack of clear early provenance leave the origin of the Archive a mystery. Most of the documents in the collection are from Italy, with a small percentage coming from Spain, France, and the Empire. A vast majority of the items are in Italian and Latin with a few documents in Spanish and French also present. A large number of early printed documents and broadsides may be found in the collection, many of them from the Stamperia Reverendae Camerae Apostolicae. Of the manuscript items, there are some original autograph documents (most notably one of Pope Clement XI, Vol. 29, No. 33a), but most are contemporary copies. Among formal treatises and histories are many letters, news bulletins, and diplomatic reports. There are also a fair number of plays and poems on various topics.</p>
         <p>The collection is especially rich in primary source material for the era of the War of Spanish Succession (1700-1713), especially in regards to the role of the Papacy and the Italian peninsula in that conflict. Several volumes contain detailed reports from Papal Conclaves, demonstrating the process by which new Popes were elected from the late Middle Ages to the eighteenth century. There are many sets of instructions to Papal Nuncios, providing an interesting glimpse into the diplomatic relations between the Apostolic See and France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Poland, Flanders, the Austrian Empire, and the various states of Italy.</p>
         <p>Series of documents within the collection provide sources and background for a number of influential individuals from the period: Cardinal Mazarin; Queen Christina of Sweden; Olimpia Maidalchini-Pamphili, sister-in-law to Pope Innocent X; King Philip V of Spain; Pope Clement XI; and King Louis XIV of France. Many letters from the Sacred College of the Cardinals provide insight into the politics which surrounded the Papacy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Certain events are also well-documented within the collection: the readmission of the Jesuits into Venice; the controversy over Jesuit missionaries in China; the 1701 revolt of Naples against the Spanish crown; the 1683 defeat of the Turks at Vienna; various tensions between Pope Alexander VII and the French King Louis XIV; the decline of the De'Medici family of Tuscany; a confrontation between Jesuits and Dominicans at the University of Douai (Flanders) in 1591; and the emergence of the Duchy of Savoy as a player in world politics.</p>
         <p>A number of scholarly and practical treatises on a wide variety of topics exist in the collection. These include ones on numerology, alchemy, astronomy, military science, cartography, rhetoric, philosophy, Aristotle, law, history, varnish-making, and equine medicine. There are two student notebooks on the subject of rhetoric, one from the Jesuit College of Rome. Specific histories are given for the cities of Venice, Pisa, Genoa, and Florence, and for the Roman Church. The collection contains an eight volume edition of the works of Paretus, who wrote works on physics soon after Newton, which contain anatomical drawings and a plan for a flying machine. Also present is a 1548 edition of Ptolemy with maps of the Americas added by the editor Giuseppe Moleto.</p>
         <p>Other items of note in the collection include:</p>
         <p>--Reports and poems about natural disasters such as earthquakes, hailstorms, and a 1660 eruption of Mt. Vesuvio.</p>
         <p>--Various treatises and broadsides in support of and against the extention and preservation of Papal authority.</p>
         <p>--Poems on subjects which range from the elegaic to the scatalogical.</p>
         <p>--Numerous satires--in drama, mock-epic, and verse--of prominent individuals of the period.</p>
         <p>--An entrance examination to a Jesuit's German and Hungarian College in Rome.</p>
         <p>--Several documents and engravings concerning drama and specific theaters in Rome.</p>
         <p>--Watercolor paintings of plans for a fireworks display in Ferrara and of the Battle of Chiari (1701).</p>
         <p>--A dictionary of legal terms.</p>
         <p>--Records of legal procedings for several cases of murder, heresy, and conspiracy, plus several records of duels, assassinations, and executions.</p>
         <p>--Administrative documents of several Nuncios and parish churches.</p>
         <p>--Several family histories and genealogical charts.</p>
         <p>--Numerous sermons and orations.</p>
         <p>--Several reports on Constantinople and accounts of relations with the Ottoman Empire.</p>
         <p>--A prayer for lawyers, asking for more arguments and lawsuits.</p>

                        Nappini, Bartolomeo (called Polipodio Calabro).
                     </title> 24 poems, 20 leaves, (foliated 18-37). Poems by the Calabrian poet Bartolomeo Nappini (d. 1717), who wrote under the pseudonym Polipodio Calabro, consisting of 20 sonnets, 2 elegies, 1 poem (in praise of the pig) in tercets, and one satirical poem. The poems are done in the "stile pedantesco," also known as the "stile fidenziano," which forces the pedantic Latin jargon of schoolmasters upon the Italian language. The last edition of Nappini's poems came out at Guastalla in 1780 and it is a bibliographical rarity.</unittitle>

                     </title> An important Ptolemy edition. Giuseppe Moleto from Messina (1531-1588), professor of mathematics in Padua, revised the Latin translation by Willibald Pirckheimer and supplied an extensive commentary to books 1 and 7. The very fine engraved maps had first appeared in Ruscelli's Italian Ptolemy edition. All except four are based upon Gastaldi's maps to the pocket edition of 1548. Ruscelli's maps are extremely well designed and became very influential in the development of cartography. His world map (no. 2) is the first engraved representation of the world divided into two spheres, the right half showing the old and the left half showing the new world. The following nine maps refer to America: Orbis descriptio; Tierra Nova; Brasil Nuova Tavola; Nueva Hispania; Tierra Nueva; Isola Spagnola Nova; Septentrionalium Partium Nova Tabula; Isola Cuva Nova; Schonlandia Nova. The second world map, "Carta Marina," (No. 3) is lacking in this copy.</unittitle>

                     </title> (p. 290) has thus far been unprocurable; or whether it is by Andrea Perrucci, a poet from Palermo, and a translator of Spanish comedies, who published a <title type="simple" render="italic">

His pontificate was quite restless: after the outburst of the War of Spanish Succession, each of the belligerent powers (France and the Empire) tried to get the papacy on its side. Emperor Joseph and Philip V both recalled their ambassador to Rome, and the Emperor had his troops raid the Papal States. (Encicl. Cottol., vol. II, col. 1832). This journal of Gozzdini's legation to Elisabeth Farnese obviously precedes the events just recited. Our ms. lists the complete personnel of the Gozzadini Legation. (See Vol. 60, #42).</unittitle>

The Duke of Ossuna was Pedro de Tellez Giron y Guzman. He was born in Osuna in 1574 and died in Madrid in 1624. The appointment of Giron as a Spanish Viceroy of Naples was due preponderantly to the good offices of the great writer Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas, and to those of the Confessor of Philip III.</unittitle>

Keeping in contact with the Marquis of Villafranca, Governor of Milan, and the Marquis of Bedman, Spanish Ambassador in Venice, he planned to dominate the whole of Italy, thwarting a similar ambition on the part of France.

A 17th century ms. copy of a discourse on the state of the Papal court, written c. 1564, when Commendone returned from the Council of Trent. Pastor (VII, pp. 327-332) devotes a long appreciation to this discourse and lists all known ms. copies (pp. 661-663). The present ms. seems to be the only one to mention Pope Pius IV (1559-1565), thereby confirming Pastor's tentative date of 1564. 223 pages, numbered ff. 1-112.</unittitle>

               <p>A detailed and authentic history of the Roman Church under Pope Clement XI at the time of the War of the Spanish Succession, comprising the years 1707-1711. The <title type="simple" render="italic">

                  </title> were evidently written soon after the events by someone who was close to the policy makers and had access to all the documents. The Memoirs are interwoven with copies from manuscript documents, decrees, and letters by the leading personalities of worldly and ecclesiastical powers. The volumes start with the bitter feud between Pope Clement XI and Joseph I in 1707-1708 and end with Joseph I's death and the election of Charles VI.</p>

               <p>There is a great emphasis placed on the role of Anniballi Albani, nephew of Pope Clement XI. The first volume ends with his departure from Rome for Vienna, the second volume with his being created Cardinal on Dec. 23, 1711. The author of these memoirs might be a secretary of Albani or someone near to him.</p>
