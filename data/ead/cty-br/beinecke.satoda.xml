         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>

         <head>Yonekazu Satoda (born 1921)</head>
         <p>Yonekazu "Yone" Satoda was born in Hanford, California in 1921, a son of Otokichi "Fred" Satoda (1885-1968), originally from Hiroshima, Japan, who immigrated to the United States in 1902, and Asano Satoda (1894-1990), who immigrated to the United States from Japan in 1920. He had two siblings, Fumiye Satoda (later Yeabisu) (born 1922) and Masaharu Satoda (born 1924).</p>
         <p>Satoda graduated from University of California in 1942, the same year that authorities sent him to the Jerome Relocation Center in Denison, Arkansas. In February 1945, the United States Army drafted Satoda. He received basic training at Camp Hood, Texas, and attended Officer Candidate School at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, as well as Military Intelligence Service Language School at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. From November 1946 to August 1948, Satoda served as a first lieutenant and military intelligence officer in Tokyo and Hokkaido, Japan. After discharge from the active duty, Satoda served in the United States Army Reserves from 1949 to 1969; he retired as a major.</p>
         <p>In March 1961, Satoda married Taka "Daisy" Uyeda (born circa 1928) and they had three children. Satoda worked as an accountant and lived in San Francisco, California.</p>
