         <head>A. Poulin (1938-1996)</head>
         <p>Al Poulin, American poet, editor, translator, and publisher, was born in Lisbon, Maine in 1938.</p>
         <p>Poulin attended St. Francis College in Maine where he received a B.A. in 1960. He continued his studies in literature at Loyola University in Chicago, where he earned an M.A. in 1960. Poulin attended the University of Iowa between 1966 and 1968 ultimately obtaining an M.F.A. in poetry (his thesis was <title type="simple" render="italic">
               In Advent: Poems and Translations
            </title>).</p>
         <p>Poulin taught literature for a number of years, with stints at Loyola University (1960-1962), St. Francis College (1962-1964; 1968-1971), the University of Maryland (1965), and the University of New Hampshire (1965-1966). In 1971 Poulin became a Professor of English at the State University of New York at Brockport, a position he held until poor health forced his retirement.</p>
         <p>In 1976 Poulin founded BOA Editions, an independent, non-profit literary publishing company specializing in American poetry and poetry-in-translation. Poulin appealed to his friend and colleague W. D. Snodgrass for a manuscript for BOA's first project, which resulted in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Führer Bunker: A Cycle of Poems in Progress
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Poulin's poetry publications include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               In Advent
            </title> (1972), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Catawba: Omens, Prayers &amp; Songs
            </title> (1977), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Widow's Taboo: Poems After the Catawba
            </title> (1977), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Nameless Garden
            </title> (1978), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Nest of Sonnets
            </title> (1985), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Momentary Order
            </title> (1987), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cave Dwellers
            </title> (1991), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Angels
            </title> (1994).</p>
         <p>He also published translations of the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke and Anne He?bert. In 1972 Poulin began editing <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Contemporary American Poetry
            </title>, an anthology published by Houghton Mifflin.</p>
         <p>Poulin was married to Basilike H. Parkas, with whom he had one daughter (Daphne). Poulin later married Elizabeth ("Boo") Poulin who he met in 1963 when teaching at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
         <p>Poulin died at the age of fifty-eight in Brockport, New York, on June 5, 1996 of complications related to pulmonary disorders.</p>
