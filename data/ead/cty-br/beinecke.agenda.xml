Writings include works submitted for publication in Agenda or the Agenda Editions and consist of articles, poems, and reviews in holograph, typescript, galley and proof form, many bearing annotations by editor or author. The production files contain advertising copy, notes, computer disks, and galleys and proofs of issues. The correspondence is between William Cookson and contributors, his associate editor Peter Dale, and other business associates. Additional papers include business papers, photographs, and a small number of printed works.

         <p>The bulk of the collection (Boxes 1-58) was processed in 1994, at which point material was arranged into four series: Writings, Production Files, Correspondence, and Additional Papers.</p>
         <p>The three later additions to the collection received minimal processing including rehousing and listing at the time of acquisition. In 2011, these three additions (Boxes 59-83) received further processing, including arrangement of material into series within each addition, reflecting the series found in the previously processed part of the collection, and more detailed file-level description. At this time, the description of the three additions was added to the finding aid for the processed collection, whereas before it had comprised a separate "unprocessed" finding aid. Since this material has not been physically merged with the fully processed part of the collection (Series I-IV), each addition is described separately in the contents list below, following the descriptions and lists for each series.</p>
         <p>The three later additions were formerly classed as Uncat MS Vault 713, Uncat MSS 199, and Uncat MSS 983.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>AGENDA</head>
         <p>The poetry journal <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> was established in 1959 as a revival of an earlier publication, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Four Pages
            </title>. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>'s founding editor was William C. Cookson; the associate editor was Edmund Gray. Gray was eventually replaced by Michael O'Higgins. In 1962 <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> was reorganized and the magazine's editorial policy was reevaluated. At that time, Cookson appointed Peter Dale associate editor and chief poetry reviewer.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> began publication out of New College, Oxford; throughout most of its history, however, it has been produced in London. At first issued monthly, by 1961 two numbers comprised one issue and eventually <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> became a quarterly. Beginning in 1965 <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> received regular grants from the Arts Council of Great Britain; this ongoing support has been a contributing factor in the success of the magazine.</p>
         <p>Cookson initially based <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>'s editorial policy on the literary and economic ideas of Ezra Pound. Over time he came to believe that the magazine was straying from its original direction and, in 1962, Cookson decided that <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> would "contain only the best poetry." The magazine would also include a regular review section, "criteria of which would be based upon Pound's early basic rules of criticism", and articles on both neglected poets and those with "inflated" reputations.</p>
         <p>By 1965 the magazine had adopted a large format with cover lettering by David Jones. Entire issues were often devoted to the work of a single poet (David Jones, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound) or to a specific type of poetry (French poetry, American poetry, or verse drama). These issues sometimes employed guest editors, such as Donald Davie and Charles Tomlinson.</p>
         <p>In 1971 Cookson and Peter Dale began the publication of "Agenda Editions," the purpose of which was to publish in book format the same type of poetry as appeared in the magazine. The first "Edition" issued was Peter Dale's translation of François Villon's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Legacy and Other Poems
            </title>. Subsequent volumes include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Roman Quarry
            </title>, by David Jones, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mortal Fire
            </title>, by Peter Dale, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Footsteps on Snow
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Curving Shore
            </title>, both by Anne Beresford, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Peguy
            </title>, by Geoffrey Hill.</p>
         <p>Since William Cookson's death in 2003, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> has been published under the editorial guidance of Patricia McCarthy.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Agenda Records, 1914-2001, consist of materials from the production files of volume 7, number 3 (1969) through volume 37, number 4 (2000) of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> magazine, related financial and other records, and additional materials from editor William Cookson's files.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into four series and three later groupings. Series I, Writings, (Boxes 1-31), is made up of works submitted for publication in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> or the "Agenda Editions." Series II, Production files, (Boxes 32-39), contains the galleys, page proofs, and other production material remaining from the work files for Volume 7:3 (1969) - Volume 22 (1984) once writings (Series I) and the correspondence (Series III) had been culled and arranged separately. The correspondence in Series III consists chiefly of exchanges between the two principal editors, William Cookson and Peter Dale, and various supporters, business associates and contributors to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and "Agenda Editions." Series IV, Additional Papers, (Boxes 53-56), contains papers and writings of William Cookson, which do not strictly relate to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>, as well as other financial records, printed material and photographs. Groupings V-VII represent later additions to the collection acquired between 1994 and 2001 and are comprised of material similar in nature and scope to that found in Series I-IV, including writings, production files, correspondence, and other papers related to Agenda and "Agenda Editions."</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref11">Series I, Writings</ref>, consists of articles, poems and reviews in various stages of completion (holographs, typescripts, galleys and proofs), many bearing holograph corrections or annotations by William Cookson or the author. Works to be found in this series include Michael Alexander's reviews of books about Ezra Pound, as well as Alexander's poem, "Of Green Fields"; an article by Noel Stock entitled "Literature and Economics: A New Correlation"; miscellaneous notes by Dorothy Pound; translations of "Cantos LXII and LXIII," by Richard Reid; "The Hunt," a poem by David Jones and an essay by Arthur Giardelli on Jones's "Trystan ac Esyllt;" Donald Davie's poems, "England" and "Ornithology"; poetry by Ronald Duncan, including "Letter to Ezra"; classical poetry in translation by Humphrey Clucas; poems translated from Persian and Arabic by Omar Pound and a large number of Editorials written for <title type="simple" render="italic">

            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref3234">Series II, Production Files,</ref>contains advertising copy, table of contents pages, notes, galleys and proofs of entire issues, arranged chronologically by issue number, including proofs of grouped responses to questionnaires on a variety of topics, which the editors of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> magazine frequently sent to individual poets and writers. Drafts of individual's responses to these questionnaires, however, were transferred to Series I, Writings, where they can be found filed under the name of the respondent.</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref3378">Series III, Correspondence</ref>, consists primarily of letters exchanged between William Cookson and various supporters and business associates, as well as contributors to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and the "Editions." Correspondence with Peter Dale, the associate editor, and Donald Davie, a guest editor, also is included. Correspondents discuss editorial aspects of writings contributed to the magazine, but also day-to-day business and news of a more personal nature.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>'s early years are well documented in this series. The files contain letters of rejection, letters asking for submissions from established poets, and requests for permissions to publish. There is correspondence in which marketing strategies are discussed, as well as letters soliciting subscriptions. Finally, correspondence between Cookson and the Arts Council of Great Britain chronicles <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>'s relationship with the Arts Council and traces the growth of its financial support. The correspondence of Associate Editor Peter Dale includes discussions of specific articles and poems as well as matters of general editorial policy.</p>
         <p>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> was based upon suggestions made by Ezra Pound in 1958. Although Cookson continued to correspond with Pound throughout the magazine's early years, the collection contains only copies of Cookson's outgoing letters; there are no letters from Pound. (Letters from Dorothy Pound, which are present, include her own comments on <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>.)</p>
         <p>In his earliest letters to Pound, Cookson outlines his plans for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>; later letters reveal his (Cookson's) growing concern that <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> was straying from Pound's philosophy, and expresses his view that editorial restructuring was necessary. In several letters Cookson solicits contributions from Pound to be published in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>; he also requests permission to publish Pound's work.</p>
         <p>Two other early supporters and contributors to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>, Michael Alexander and Peter Russell, also are well represented in the correspondence files. In his letters, Alexander suggests names of individuals Cookson might wish to contact for help with <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>. He discusses his own submissions and also comments on Pound and his work. Russell, a bookseller, publisher, poet, and professor, advertised in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and contributed his own poetry. His letters offer comments on the magazine's format, criticism of poetry and articles, and advice on dealing with publishers and printers. Due to disagreements with Cookson over the acceptance of his own work, Russell eventually stopped contributing.</p>
         <p>Over the years Cookson and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> established contacts with many other presses and publishers and these, too, are well documented in the correspondence files. The letters between Cookson and Michael Schmidt of Carcanet Press concern the inclusion of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and "Agenda Editions" in Carcanet's catalogues as well as possible marketing strategies. In addition to requests for review copies, correspondence between Cookson and Peter du Sautoy of Faber and Faber makes reference to advertising, plans to publish a book by David Jones, and problems encountered in publishing the works of Ezra Pound. The Faber files also trace the publication history of the Cookson edition of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Selected Prose of Ezra Pound 1909-1965.
            </title>
         </p>
         <p>In Cookson's correspondence with James Laughlin of New Directions one again finds discussions of difficulties encountered in efforts to publish works by Ezra Pound. There are inquiries about available <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cantos
            </title>, discussions of copyrights to the books of prose, and remarks on difficulties that arose at the time of Pound's death. There is also correspondence dealing with permission to publish poems by William Carlos Williams in a special edition of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>, and letters discussing poems Laughlin himself submitted to Agenda.</p>
         <p>In addition to tracking the role early supporters and business associates played in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>'s development and eventual success, the correspondence series documents the on-going relationship between <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and the many poets whose works were published in the magazine or in the "Editions." Among the poets who figure most prominently in this series one finds Hugh MacDiarmid, Peter Levi, C. H. Sisson, Charles Tomlinson, Peter Whigham, and Louis Zukofsky. Letters from Basil Bunting reveal his thoughts on the classical and myth issues of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title> and his opinions on the younger generation of poets. The Scottish poet Tom Scott suggests a Scottish number of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>, and comments on Ezra Pound and possible contributions to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Agenda
            </title>, such as the poem "Auld-farrant Gecks."</p>
         <p>In several cases, individual poets achieved particular prominence and entire issues or volumes of the "Agenda Editions" were devoted to their work. Of these featured poets, David Jones is particularly well represented. In addition to the letters from Jones himself, he is also a frequent subject in the correspondence of others. The correspondence of René Hague, for example, concerns articles on Jones and discussions of Jones's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Kensington
            </title>
            <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mass
            </title> and Hague's book <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Dai Greatcoat
            </title>. There is also a manuscript of "A Note on Anamnesis". Other Jones scholars whose correspondence can be found in this series are David Blamires, Keith Bosley, Louis Bonnerot, Arthur Giardelli, Tony Stoneburner, and Colin Wilcockson.</p>
         <p>Other noteworthy correspondents in this series include Sabine Awiszus, D. G. Bridson, Thomas Carter, Guy Davenport, Barbara Eastman, Eric Homberger, Jamila Ismail, Hugh Kenner, Eva Hesse, Harry Meacham, Desmond O'Grady, John Peck, Daniel Pearlman, Sister Mary Bernetta Quinn, and Noel Stock.</p>
         <p>
