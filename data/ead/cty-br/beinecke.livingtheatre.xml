         <head>The Living Theatre</head>
         <p>Founded in 1947 as an imaginative alternative to the commercial theater by Judith Malina, the German-born student of Erwin Piscator, and Julian Beck, an abstract expressionist painter of the New York School, The Living Theatre has staged nearly a hundred productions performed in eight languages in 28 countries on five continents - a unique body of work that has influenced theater the world over.</p>
         <p>During the 1950's and early 1960's in New York, The Living Theatre pioneered the unconventional staging of poetic drama - the plays of American writers like Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, Paul Goodman, Kenneth Rexroth and John Ashbery, as well as European writers rarely produced in America, including Cocteau, Lorca, Brecht and Pirandello. Best remembered among these productions, which marked the start of the Off-Broadway movement, were <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Tonight We Improvise
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Many Loves
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Connection
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Brig
            </title>.</p>
         <p>In the mid-1960's, the company began a new life as a nomadic touring ensemble. In Europe, they evolved into a collective, living and working together toward the creation of a new form of nonfictional acting based on the actor's political and physical commitment to using the theater as a medium for furthering social change. The landmark achievements of this period include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mysteries and Smaller Pieces
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Antigone
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Frankenstein
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Paradise Now
            </title>.</p>
         <p>In the 1970's, The Living Theatre began to create <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Legacy of Cain
            </title>, a cycle of plays for non-traditional venues. From the prisons of Brazil to the gates of the Pittsburgh steel mills, and from the slums of Palermo to the schools of New York City, the company offered these plays, which include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Six Public Acts
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Money Tower
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Seven Meditations on Political Sado-Masochism
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Turning the Earth
            </title> and the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Strike Support Oratorium
            </title> free of charge to the broadest of all possible audiences.</p>
         <p>The 1980's saw the group return to the theater, where they developed new participatory techniques that enable the audience to first rehearse with the company and then join them on stage as fellow performers. These plays include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Prometheus at the Winter Palace
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Yellow Methuselah
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Archaeology of Sleep
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Following the death of Julian Beck in 1985, co-founder Judith Malina and the company's new director, veteran Hanon Reznikov, who first encountered The Living Theatre while a student at Yale in 1968, opened a new performing space in Manhattan's Lower East Side, producing a steady stream of innovative works including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Tablets, I and I
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Body of God
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Humanity
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Rules of Civility
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Waste
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Echoes of Justice
            </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Zero Method
            </title>. After the closing of the Third Street space in 1993, the company went on to create <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Anarchia
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Utopia
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Capital Changes
            </title> in other New York City venues.</p>
         <p>In 1999, with funds from the European Union, they renovated a 1650 Palazzo Spinola in Rocchetta Ligure, Italy and reopened it as the Centro Living Europa, a residence and working space for the company's European programs. There they created <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Resistenza
            </title>, a dramatization of the local inhabitants' historical resistance to the German occupation of 1943-45. In recent years, the company has also been performing <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Resist Now!
            </title>, a play for anti-globalization demonstrations both in Europe and the U.S. A month-long collaboration with local theater artists in Lebanon in 2001 resulted in the creation of a site-specific play about the abuse of political detainees in the notorious former prison at Khiam.</p>
         <p>The Living Theatre has opened a new theatre at 21 Clinton Street, presenting <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Brig
            </title>. They continue also to present <title type="simple" render="italic">
               NO SIR!
            </title>, a play for the street against military recruitment.</p>
