         <head>Stanley Yale Beach (1877-1955)</head>
         <p>Stanley Yale Beach, an American inventor, descended from a prominent family of noted inventors, engineers, and publishers in New York and Connecticut. His great-grandfather was Moses Yale Beach (1800-1868), an inventor, publisher of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Sun
            </title>, and founder of the Associated Press. His grandfather was Alfred Ely Beach (1826-1896), for fifty years the editor and publisher of the journal <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scientific American
            </title>, though best remembered for two of his inventions, a Braille typewriter for the blind and the Beach Pneumatic Railway, the first subterranean transit system in New York City. His father was Frederick Converse Beach (1848-1918), an 1868 graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University, a New York patent attorney, photographer, founding editor of the journal <title type="simple" render="italic">
               American Amateur Photographer
            </title>, publisher and editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scientific American
            </title>, and editor-in-chief of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Encyclopedia Americana
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Stanley Yale Beach was born on July 9, 1877, in Stratford, Connecticut, to Frederick and Margaret Gilbert Beach. Like his father, he attended the Sheffield Scientific School, graduating in 1898, and afterward developed a lifetime interest in aeronautics, engineering, and inventing. In 1897 Beach eloped with Helen Birdseye Curtis, a student at Wellesley College and a resident of Stratford, where the couple settled and raised their children Frederick, Alfred, and Margaret. Even though he had a career as first "Automobile Editor" and then "Aeronautic Editor" of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scientific American
            </title>, Beach appears to have been primarily supported by income from a trust set up by his father in 1914, and by checks received periodically from his mother. During the week Beach operated out of the Beach Building at 125 East 23rd Street in New York City, and from there ran various entrepreneurial enterprises such as the Beach Engineering Company, the Beach Laboratories, the Scientific Aeroplane Company, and associations including the Aero Science Club. Also during the week and in New York, Beach maintained an apartment and a secret second family: his paramour Marie Danner, also known as Caroline Watson, and their daughter Winifred, also known as Marguerite. Helen Beach was aware of her husband's infidelity from Winifred's birth in 1908, but refused his request to grant him a divorce so that he might marry Marie and allow Winifred to be legally recognized in the Beach family inheritance his other children would receive. His wife, sister, son, and other family members collaborated to suspend Beach's trust payments when the affair became public in 1925, and when Beach subsequently took them to court, the proceedings were covered in the New York newspapers with headlines such as "Stirs Skeleton of Blue Bloods." Stanley and Helen Beach were divorced in 1928 and he married Marie Danner on June 14 of that year.</p>
         <p>Although he fell out with most of the members of his family over his finances and life choices, Beach maintained a good relationship with his wealthy aunt, Jennie Beach Gasper, who was one of his trustees. He was also a favorite of his grandmother, Harriet Holbrook Beach, who had developed a great interest in Spiritualism. Within a year of her husband Alfred's death Harriet Beach married a medium, Henry Richardson Rogers, in Alexandria, Egypt, and soon after her two children, upon finding that their mother had signed their late father's significant fortune over to Rogers, began legal proceedings to declare her mentally incompetent; they succeeded, and the marriage was annulled in May 1899. A quarter-century later, Stanley Yale Beach also took an interest in Spiritualism and formed a friendship with the blind New York clairvoyant Vesta la Viesta, known for her detailed public presentations on her journeys to Mars and Venus. He appears to have worked as a secretary to her, and used the verso of her letterhead to make carbon copies of his outgoing correspondence.</p>
         <p>Stanley Yale Beach died in New City, New York, on July 13, 1955.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains correspondence with Beach's friends and professional colleagues, including engineers, aviators, manufacturers, and others working in aeronautical and mechanical pursuits. Several files hold both sides of the correspondence, as Beach kept carbon copies of many of his outgoing letters, typed or handwritten. In addition to research for his own projects, he was often trying to interest potential investors in his ideas and inventions, and topics covered in the letters include television systems, astrology, patents, patent attorneys, inventors, oil exploration, and aeronautical fabrics. Prominent among the correspondents are the German engineers Nikolaus Basenach, C. W. Erich Meyer, and Max U. Schoop; manufacturers such as the Centrifugal Hammer Company; aviators such as Frank C. Wright (François Raiche); and inventors including Henry House and Ernest Peter Vincent. One of the largest sets of correspondence is with Harry Arthur Powell, a friend and poet who had worked for a time for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Scientific American
                  </title>. Also in the series is his correspondence with the psychic Mrs. Almira Gaylord Beach (familial relationship to Stanley Beach unknown) who practiced under the name Vesta la Viesta, and some correspondence she had received from others. Beach appears to have worked for her, as well as having consulted her for his investigation of the fate of the French aviators Charles Nungesser and François Coli, whose biplane, the White Bird, disappeared in 1927 while attempting the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York. Also present is Beach's correspondence with M. A. Thoms of Toronto, J. T. Richards at the Anglican Mission of Flower's Cove, Newfoundland, and John Stone, a local resident who heard the White Bird pass overhead. In a single letter to Howard Hughes, Beach asks for an appointment to present his plans for a dirigible for Hughes's use; his reply is not in the papers.</p>
               <p>Photographs follow the correspondence files; some may have once been enclosed in letters but were later separated, while others may have been collected or taken by Beach. The images are predominantly related to aeronautics and engineering, and had already been grouped by subject before the Beach papers arrived at the library. Among the photographs are a set related to a stunt flying event at the airfield in Mineola, on New York's Long Island; noted American Brigadier General William (Billy) Mitchell is among the participating aviators. Additional photographs appear in correspondence files in this series, in particular the folders for Basenach and Meyer which contain early aviation images, and Schoop, a pioneer developer of thermal spray devices for coating metals, whose letters included photographs of him and his tools.</p>

               <p>The series contains Beach's correspondence with his mother, aunt, children, cousins, and others, primarily related to the financial and legal issues with which Beach vexed his family over many years. Also present are folders of insurance and financial documents, the latter mostly related to his disputes with banks and firms to which he owed money for services rendered. Following those are legal files largely regarding the administration of Beach's trust account and his attempts to engage counsel to argue on his behalf against his family and various business firms.</p>

               <p>The series holds miscellaneous material, primarily ephemera, related to Beach's life and work. The clippings were cut from newspapers; some may have been enclosed in letters in Series I and II, but were later separated and grouped together before the collection arrived at the library. The topics are varied but many are stories and news reports on themes predominant in Beach's life: airplanes, divorces, and inheritances. Technology ephemera contains published brochures and trade catalogs for machines, air and motor vehicles, and other advances such as the Telegraphone; it also contains a copy of Beach's own brochure "To Make America the Birth Place of the Vertically Rising Aeroplane" with one of his business cards. Writings contains manuscripts, typescripts, and printed versions of writings by Beach. The final folders contain scraps of paper and other ephemera too varied for classification.</p>
