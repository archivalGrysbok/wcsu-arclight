The collection documents Cooper's writing career, service in the United States Navy, and travels through Europe, and consists of correspondence, writings, personal papers, legal and financial documents, clippings, artwork, and objects. As an author who was engaged in the process of printing and publishing his works, and who was deeply interested in copyright, Cooper's papers shed light on book production during the mid nineteenth-century.</abstract>

         <p>The collection was largely catalogued prior to the creation of the finding aid. At that time it was loosely organized into genres and then arranged alphabetically. Individual catalogue cards were created for each document and each document was assigned a specific call number. Printed material were catalogued separately and assigned call numbers (Za C786+S1; Zza C786 S1; and Za F244 + S1).</p>
         <p>A finding aid was created in 2010. At that time processed and unprocessed material were integrated into one finding aid with a new title and a new call number. The new call number replaced the old, separate call numbers from the catalogue cards (an index to these old call numbers is provided in Appendix A). The old call numbers were: Uncat Za Cooper; YCAL MSS Misc 450 F-1; YCAL MSS Misc 450 F-2; YCAL MSS Misc 450 F-3; YCAL MSS Misc 450 F-4; Uncat Za File 720; Uncat Za File Cooper; Uncat Za File Coooper; Za C786+S1; Zza C786 S1; Za C786+1; and PC2 Shelf 5 #309.</p>

         <head>James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851)</head>
         <p>James Fenimore Cooper, American novelist, was born on September 15, 1789, to William and Elizabeth Fenimore Cooper in Burlington, New Jersey. Cooper attended Yale College from 1803 to 1805, but was expelled before receiving a degree. In 1806 he worked on a merchant vessel, the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Sterling
            </title>, in order to acquire experience necessary before joining the navy in 1808. He served in several posts, including midshipman, paymaster, and quartermaster. Cooper resigned from the navy shortly after he married Susan Augusta De Lancey in 1811. During the first years of their marriage the couple lived in Westchester County, Cooperstown (founded by Cooper's father), and New York City, and throughout this period Cooper was involved in a number of business ventures, including whaling. He published his first novel (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Precaution
            </title>) in 1820, which launched his career as an author of a number of novels, non-fiction, and travel books. Among Cooper's best known works are his historical novels, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Last of the Mohicans
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Pioneers
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Prairie
            </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Spy
            </title>, and nautical novels including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Pilot
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Homeward Bound
            </title>. In 1826 Cooper moved to Europe, which inspired his trilogy of European novels as well as several non-fiction travel accounts. He returned to the U.S. in 1833, and after a period in New York City, moved to the Cooper family home, Otsego Hall, in Cooperstown where he died in 1851.</p>
         <p>Susan Augusta De Lancey, the third child of John Peter and Elizabeth Floyd De Lancey was born on January 28, 1792 in Mamaroneck, New York. Her siblings were Thomas James, Anne Charlotte, Caroline, and Edward. John Peter De Lancey was a former British army officer and the De Lanceys were a prominent New York family. Susan Cooper is credited with motivating her husband to become an author, by suggesting that he write a better novel when he criticized a book he was reading to her. At times she also acted as a proof reader for Cooper when he was unavailable to check page proofs. Susan De Lancey Cooper died in Cooperstown in 1852.</p>
         <p>The Coopers had five children who lived into adulthood, their four daughters, Susan, Caroline, Anne, and Maria, and son, Paul. Susan Fenimore Cooper (1813-1894) served as her father's copyist and eventually as his literary executor. She worked closely with him during the writing process, and evidence of her involvement is traced in forewords she wrote for Household editions of her father's works (published between 1876 and 1884) as well as her articles "A Glance Backward" and "A Second Glance Backward" published in the Atlantic Monthly (1887). She also edited <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Papers and Pictures from the Writings of James Fenimore Cooper
            </title> (1861). In turn, James Fenimore Cooper promoted his daughter's literary career; her books include: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Elinor Wyllys; or, The Young Folk of Longbridge
            </title>(1845), <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The James Fenimore Cooper Collection provides evidence of the personal and professional life of James Fenimore Cooper, and to a lesser degree, the Cooper family, between 1792 and 1976. The papers chronicle Cooper's writing career, involvement in the navy, and travels through Europe, and consist of correspondence, writings, personal papers, legal and financial documents, clippings, artwork, and objects. As an author who was engaged in the process of printing and publishing his works, as well as in establishing and protecting his own copyright, Cooper's papers shed light on book production during the mid-nineteenth century.</p>
         <p>James Fenimore Cooper's creative process can be traced in the collection, which contains documents from various stages in producing a work, ranging from notebooks and research material to handwritten drafts, proofs, printed versions, and reviews. Cooper gained a reputation during his lifetime, and evidence of his fame can be found in correspondents requesting his autograph, letters inviting him to lecture, various articles about him and his home, Otsego Hall, engraved portraits, and correspondence with Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of Cooper (an image of which can be found in the Art Series). However, Cooper's fame also impacted the preservation of his literary manuscripts, pages of which were often dispersed to various collectors and autograph seekers; for this reason many of his drafts have missing sections. Material objects reflecting Cooper's profession as a writer, such as his travel desk and desk set, are also part of the collection.</p>
         <p>James Fenimore Cooper was keenly aware and protective of his legal rights. His interest in copyright is evident in his correspondence with his printers and publishers, such as his care in establishing copyright in the U.S. and England and his concern when pirated works appeared of his novels. He kept detailed notes about copyright ownership found in his "Copy Right Book" (1842) and was in possession of a pamphlet on "An Act to Amend the Laws Relating to Dramatic Literary Property" (1833). Cooper also held the copyright for Susan Fenimore Cooper's publication <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Rural Hours
            </title>, and his family filed for copyright ownership of a number of Cooper's works following his death. In many ways Cooper's interest in copyright reflects the financial realities of his career as an author, as can be traced in various financial documents in the collection.</p>
         <p>Between 1839 and 1845 Cooper was also involved in a number of legal proceedings, most notably libel cases filed against publishers, such as Park Benjamin (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               The New World
            </title>), Horace Greeley and Thomas McElrath (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Tribune
            </title>), William L. Stone (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Commercial Advertiser
            </title>), Thurlow Weed (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Evening Journal
            </title>), and James Watson Webb (<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Courier and Enquirer
            </title>). As various clippings in the collection indicate, these cases received extensive press coverage.</p>
         <p>Cooper's career in the navy is evidenced by warrants appointing Cooper midshipman, paymaster, and quartermaster. As an author he maintained an interest in maritime topics, which can be seen in his work to write <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The History of the Navy of the United States of America
            </title>, seafaring-themed novels such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Pilot
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Water Witch
            </title>, and several articles for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Naval Magazine
            </title>. He also corresponded with a number of naval officers such as William Branford Shubrick and Charles Wilkes, as well as Ned Myers (who inspired <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Ned Myers: A Life Before the Mast
            </title>). After leaving the navy Cooper was briefly involved in whaling, which is chronicled in his correspondence with partner Charles T. Dering and an account book for the whaling vessel <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Union
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Cooper served as the American consul in Lyons, France, and lived in Europe for seven years. A letter appointing Cooper to this position, signed by John Quincy Adams, is included in the collection, along with other items relating to the family's move to Europe, such as visas, travel documents, a passport, and calling cards. This period is also reflected in Cooper's correspondence with the Marquis de Lafayette and William Cabell Rives. While living in Europe, Cooper fostered relationships with publishers, such as Charles Gosselin in France and Duncker &amp; Humblot in Germany, who published translations of his novels.</p>
         <p>Cooper's family life can be traced in his correspondence with his wife and children, as well as with extended family members. In addition, the family's everyday life can be glimpsed through their financial records, documenting the purchase of household items. In his diaries, which largely date from 1832 to 1835 in the collection, Cooper discusses his activities and opinions, including his experience of reading various chapters in the Bible. Because the Coopers, and their relatives the De Lanceys, Phinneys, and Pomeroys, were prominent American families, the collection is a window into social and political life during the nineteenth century. Cooper's correspondents include Daniel D. Barnard, Charles Jared Ingersoll, Joseph Reed Ingersoll, and John Jay (and his sons Peter A. and William), and Samuel F. B. Morse.</p>

               <head>Arrangement</head>
               <p>The series is organized into three subseries: General Correspondence; Family Correspondence; and Third Party Correspondence.</p>
            </arrangement>
            <scopecontent id="aspace_7ecdcdb68eac94ad4db09b2d8dcff0b4">
               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series documents Cooper's personal relationships and professional life, ranging from various ventures to his writing career and work as the American consul in Lyons, France.</p>
               <p>Correspondence between Cooper and his publishers, most notably Richard Bentley in England and Carey &amp; Lea in the U.S., and his stereotyper, John Fagan, provide insight into the publishing process. The costs and processes involved in printing during the nineteenth century, discussions on copyright and the issue of piracy, and concerns about marketing and sales, are well represented in this correspondence. Cooper's relationships with publishers Lea &amp; Blanchard, Stringer &amp; Townsend, and G. P. Putnam are also represented, though to a lesser degree.</p>
               <p>Cooper's experiences while living in Europe between 1826 and 1833 can be found, for example, in his correspondence with the Marquis de Lafayette and William Cabell Rives (who was serving as minister to France). While living in Europe Cooper also worked with European publishers such as Charles Gosselin in Paris and Duncker &amp; Humblot in Berlin.</p>
               <p>Cooper's involvement with, and interest in, the navy is captured in his correspondence, including his friendships with prominent naval officers William Branford Shubrick and Charles Wilkes, as well as Ned Myers (on whom Cooper based <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Ned Myers: A Life Before the Mast
                  </title>). Cooper's correspondence with a number of naval officers who served as resources for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The History of the Navy of the United States of America
                  </title> can be found under this title in Writings (Series II).</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>A number of Cooper's acquaintances were prominent lawyers and government officials, including Daniel D. Barnard, Charles Jared Ingersoll, Joseph Reed Ingersoll, and John Jay (and his sons Peter A. and William). Cooper's friends also included Samuel F. B. Morse, merchant James de Peyster Ogden, and Charles T. Dering, with whom Cooper briefly entered the whaling business. Cooper also paid into several ventures with his niece's husband, Horace H. Comstock, who founded Comstock (Michigan) and who was originally from Cooperstown.</p>
               <p>Letters regarding the election of Cooper to various societies, requesting Cooper to lecture, requesting autographs, and various invitations can be found at the end of General Correspondence subseries.</p>
               <p>The Family Correspondence subseries contains correspondence Cooper sent to his immediate and extended family and correspondence sent between family members. Correspondence sent to Cooper from family members – family names include Cooper, De Lancey, Phinney, and Pomeroy – can be found in the General Correspondence subseries.</p>
               <p>The Third-Party Correspondence subseries is comprised of letters which could not be associated with material in the subseries above.</p>

               <p>The series documents James Fenimore Cooper's writing career from the late 1820s until his death in 1851. While the papers do not include drafts for some of his better known novels, the series does contain material from a number of his writing projects, including several novels, articles, and essays.</p>
               <p>The series is comprised of documents from various stages of his writing process, from notebooks and drafts to printed versions and reviews. Following Cooper's death many of his manuscripts were dismantled and distributed to autograph collectors; as a result, many of the drafts here are incomplete. Major Works consists of Cooper's novels and non-fiction writings. Essays includes articles, such as Cooper's "Elaborate Review," regarding the proceedings of the naval court martial of Alexander Mackenzie. Other Writings includes contracts, fragments, and letters to the editor; published versions of Cooper's letters to the editor can also be found in Printed Material, Series III.</p>
               <p>The subseries Writings of Others contains academic scholarship on Cooper, as well as work by Cooper's grandson and a critique by Mark Twain. Also present is an essay by Cooper's daughter, Susan Fenimore Cooper, and comic book adaptations from the 1940s of James Fenimore Cooper's novels.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains various documents relating to Cooper's personal life and writing career. The Diaries and Notebooks subseries records Cooper's travels, for example, while in Holland, Switzerland, France, and Italy, as well as notebooks on legal matters such as his "Copy Right Book" and accusations against Horace H. Comstock, with whom Cooper invested in real estate. Cooper's memorandum books, which chronicle his daily life predominantly between 1832 and 1835, provide insight into his activities and thoughts, including his impressions of what he was reading.</p>
               <p>A number of court cases involving Cooper, the majority of which were libel suits, can be found in Legal Records. Briefs, court records, lawyer's notes, witnesses' testimony, and other documents provide evidence of Cooper's litigious relationship with the press. In many cases his nephew Richard Cooper served as his lawyer. This subseries also contains copyright documents filed by Cooper's family members following his death.</p>
               <p>Cooper's account books, located in Financial Records, along with bills, accounts, and receipts, reveal his personal finances. His brief partnership with Charles T. Dering in the whaling business is documented in an account book for the whaling vessel <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Union
                  </title>. His accounts with printers and publishers are also included in the Financial Records subseries and provide insight into Cooper's income and various costs associated with printing his writings. Extensive bills, accounts, and receipts, dating from 1812 to 1851, capture everyday realities of the Cooper family. Financial material for the Coopers' son, Paul, are also included in the subseries.</p>
               <p>The Other Papers subseries contains material pertaining to Cooper and his family members, ranging from documents granting appointments to a recipe for yeast. Among the papers are a series of warrants appointing Cooper to several military positions, from midshipman to paymaster and quartermaster, within the navy. In addition, Cooper's appointment as consul of Lyons, France, along with his move to Europe, is chronicled in various official letters, visas, travel documents, a passport, and calling cards.</p>
               <p>The Printed Material subseries includes a number of printed items such as maps and engravings of New York City and asylums. The Clippings subseries consists of newspaper clippings with Cooper's letters to the editor as well as commentary by the press on his writings and libel suits.</p>
