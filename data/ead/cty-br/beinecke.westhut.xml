         <head>G. EVELYN HUTCHINSON (1903-1991)</head>
         <p>G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a zoologist well-known for his work on the ecology of freshwater lakes, was born in Cambridge, England in 1903 and received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge University. In 1928 he joined the faculty of Yale University, rising to become Sterling Professor of Zoology from 1952-71, when he retired from teaching. He became a citizen of the United States in 1941.</p>
         <p>Hutchinson, a man of wide literary interests, was introduced to the writings of Rebecca West by his wife Margaret, who admired the British feminist author greatly. Hutchinson himself was taken with her 1928 book of criticism, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Strange Necessity.
            </title> As he explained in "First Encounter with Rebecca West:"</p>
         <p>"The theme of this study is that all important art represents a journey of discovery. She held to this view as a major aspect of aesthetics and from it derived a view that the creative processes of science and art are basically similar. Although the basic idea of the book was hardly noticed by literary authorities, it was a view that instantly appealed to me."</p>
         <p>In 1947 Hutchinson began discussing West's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Black Lamb and Grey Falcon
            </title> in his regular <title type="simple" render="italic">
               American Scientist
            </title> columns, and sent West copies of these at his wife's suggestion. This led to West's first visit with the Hutchinsons and resulted in a lifelong friendship among West, Hutchinson and his wife. Hutchinson published his bibliography of West's writings, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Preliminary List of the Writings of Rebecca West, 1912-1951
            </title>, in 1957 to coincide with her appearance at Yale as Terry Lecturer, and was instrumental in her gift of her papers to the university as well.</p>
         <p>In addition to his West bibliography and many scholarly articles on aquatic ecosystems and aspects of evolution, Hutchinson's works include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Clear Mirror
            </title> (1936), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A treatise on Limnology
            </title> (1957, 1967, 1975), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Enchanted Voyage
            </title> (1962), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Ecological Theater and the Evolutionary Play
            </title> (1965), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Introduction to Population Ecology
            </title> (1978). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949 and to the National Academy of Science in the following year. In 1971 he received the Edward Browning Achievement Award, and in 1974 the Tyler and the Cottrell Awards. G. Evelyn Hutchinson died in Cambridge, England in 1991.</p>

         <p>The G. Evelyn Hutchinson Papers Related to Rebecca West spans the years 1927-1988. The papers are organized in four series: <title type="simple" render="italic">

                  Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, is divided into five subseries: Rebecca West, Henry Andrews, Secretarial, Third-Party (Rebecca West), and Third-Party (G. Evelyn Hutchinson). The correspondence between West and Hutchinson, who had long admired West's critical writings, began in earnest in 1947 and continued until West's death in 1983. Hutchinson and his wife Margaret soon became confidantes of West's, and she wrote in much detail about all aspects of her personal life, including her marriage to Henry Andrews, her difficult relations with her son Anthony West and his family, her troubles with servants, and her friendships. Letters written in the 1950s describe her reaction to the publication of her son's novel <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Heritage
            </title> and her efforts to block its appearance in Great Britain. She also frequently discussed her political opinions in general and the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy in particular, noting that her anti-Communist position was often misunderstood as an endorsement of McCarthyism but maintaining that the dangers of that movement were being exaggerated for propaganda purposes.</p>
         <p>After Hutchinson expressed his desire to compile a bibliography of her writings, West's letters frequently included current and past newspaper articles and information on her earlier works. The letters also reflect Hutchinson's promotion of West for the Terry Lectures of 1957 at Yale and his involvement in her gift of her papers to that university. West's subsequent decision to open the H. G. Wells correspondence to Gordon N. Ray, and her opinion of his <title type="simple" render="italic">
               H. G. Wells and Rebecca West
            </title>, are also the subjects of much discussion.</p>
         <p>The letters of West's husband Henry Andrews and of West's secretaries contain news of West during her travels or periods of illness, as well as clippings and information for the Hutchinson's bibliography.</p>
         <p>Third-Party Correspondence (Rebecca West) contains miscellaneous letters to and from West, possibly sent to Hutchinson by her for inclusion in her collection at Yale. Third-Party Correspondence (G. Evelyn Hutchinson) holds much West-related correspondence, including letters from her authorized biographer Victoria Glendinning, the publisher Alan MacLean, Virago Press, and Diana Stainforth.</p>

               H. G. Wells and Rebecca West
            </title>; documentation of several events in West's life, including the 1957 Terry Lectures at Yale, her honorary degree from New York University, and her funeral and memorial services; and extensive "catalog notes" by Hutchinson on his correspondence with West.</p>
         <p>Literary Estate of Rebecca West, the third subseries, includes acknowledgments of West's and Hutchinson's gifts to Yale, lists of unpublished works owned by the estate, and eight folders of notes and minutes of meetings of the literary executors from 1983 to 1985. Subjects include negotiations over the sale of the remainder of the West archive, publication strategies for the still-unpublished work, and the roles of West's authorized biographers.</p>
