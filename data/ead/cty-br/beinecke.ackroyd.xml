         <head>Processing Information</head>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including in some instances rehousing and minimal organization, when it arrived at the library. Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, identified as a unique grouping and titled according to year and month of acquisition.</p>
         <p>The finding aid for this collection is compiled from individual preliminary lists for each acquisition that were created at or around the time of receipt by the library. The preliminary lists were migrated to comply with current archival descriptive standards and merged into a single file in 2007-2008. As part of the migration, modifications were made to the formatting of individual lists; however, the content of the lists was neither modified nor verified.</p>
         <p>As a rule, descriptive information found in the Collection Contents section is drawn in large part from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>

         <head>Peter Ackroyd (1949- )</head>
         <p>Peter Ackroyd, British novelist, critic, poet, biographer, and essayist, was born in London on October 5, 1949, and raised in East Acton. Educated at Saint Benedict's School, Ealing, he graduated from Clare College, Cambridge, in 1971 with a degree in English, and studied at Yale University under a Mellon Foundation fellowship from 1971 to 1973. Ackroyd was the literary editor of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Spectator
            </title> from 1973 to 1977, and managing editor from 1977 to 1981. He is the author of more than a dozen novels, four books of poetry, and over twenty works of non-fiction, including studies of the cities of London and Venice, the authors Blake, Chaucer, Dickens, Eliot, Poe, Pound, and Shakespeare, and the cultures of Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Ackroyd has won numerous literary awards, was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2003, and elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.</p>
         <p>His partner Brian Michael Kuhn was born in New York on June 26, 1952. Ackroyd and Kuhn met while Ackroyd was studying in the United States; afterward Kuhn moved to England, living in London and Devon from 1973 until his death from an AIDS-related illness in 1994.</p>

In order to locate all relevant material within this collection, researchers should consult each acquisition described in the Collection Contents section.</p>
         <p>Researchers should also note that similar material can be arranged differently in each acquisition, depending on how the material was organized when it was received by the library.</p>
