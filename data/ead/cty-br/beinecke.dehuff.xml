         <p>This collection was reprocessed in 2007-2008. After the collection was conserved, matted, and boxed according to size, its arrangement was changed. The numbers associated with each piece of art in the original finding aid have been retained, and are listed in the finding aid at the end of the description for each item. These numbers can be used to reconstruct the previous arrangement. Titles have been supplied for works that were previously untitled to better distinguish works of art in the collection.</p>

         <head>Elizabeth Willis DeHuff (1892-1983)</head>
         <p>
            <persname>
               Elizabeth Willis DeHuff
            </persname> was born to John Turner and Ann Boyd Wilson Willis of Augusta, Georgia in the latter part of the 19th century. Some sources indicate her birth year as 1892, while others suggest it was 1886. She grew up in Augusta, one of five Willis children.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth was educated at the Lucy Cobb Institute in Athens, Georgia, and then attended Barnard College in New York City. In 1910, she took a teaching job in the Philippine Islands. While in the Philippines, she met John David DeHuff (1872-1945), another American teacher. Elizabeth returned to the United States, married John David, and in 1913 moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania where John David assumed a post at the Carlisle Indian School. In 1916, John David was appointed superintendent of the Indian School in Santa Fe, New Mexico and the couple relocated.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth became interested in the art and culture of the Southwest. With approval from her husband, she brought boys from the Santa Fe Indian School into the DeHuff home in the afternoons for painting lessons. The boys who received training included Fred Kabotie, Otis Polelonema (both Hopi) and Velino Shije Herrera (of Zia Pueblo). In 1919, she organized an exhibit of her students' art at the Museum of New Mexico.</p>
         <p>Controversy erupted around Elizabeth's art instruction when critics of her work with students alleged that the sessions encouraged paganism, emphasizing traditional stories and documenting tribal religious customs. In 1927 John David became secretary of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce, a position he held until his death in 1945; the couple left the Santa Fe Indian School and Elizabeth's lessons ceased.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth wrote and published several children's stories on Native American themes during and after her experience with Indian School students. Her books include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Taytay's Tales
            </title>, a collection of Indian traditional stories illustrated with the art of her students Fred Kabotie and Otis Polelonema, published in 1922; <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Taytay's Memories
            </title>, published in 1924; and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Swift Eagle of the Rio Grande
            </title>, published in 1928. Elizabeth also wrote numerous periodical articles on American Indian, Latin American, and New Mexico historical and cultural topics. She published regularly in the magazine of the Museum of New Mexico, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               El Palacio
            </title>. A visible figure in Santa Fe, Elizabeth lectured several nights a week from 1926 through the mid-1940s at the La Fonda Hotel as part of the Santa Fe Railroad's Indian Detours.</p>
         <p>The DeHuffs had three children: David, Ann, and Frances. After John David's death in 1945, Elizabeth returned to Georgia where she wrote and undertook genealogical research until her death in 1983.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Elizabeth Willis DeHuff Collection of American Indian Art consists of 199 drawings, paintings, and sketches by Pueblo, Navajo (Diné), Apache, Cheyenne, and Kiowa Indian artists, including many works by young people. The artworks, which date from approximately 1917 to 1945, appear to have been produced primarily between the1920s and the 1940s. The collection reveals the connections and relationships that the DeHuffs cultivated with Indian artists in the Southwest and highlights, in some cases, the development and evolution of the individual style of specific artists and the prominence of certain themes and subjects in their work. The collection reflects Elizabeth DeHuff's interest in the art and culture of the Southwest, and her ongoing support of the artistic expression of young Indians.</p>
         <p>The artworks in the collection were created both by DeHuff's students at the Santa Fe Indian School and by other Native artists. In many cases, the age and tribal affiliation of the artists is noted in a caption on the verso or recto of the piece. The drawings and paintings depict traditional stories and figures, traditional social and ceremonial dances, traditional designs, and daily Indian life. A number of the pieces are annotated in pencil, with markings and notes indicating cropping and comments related to printing.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth's husband, John David, was the intended recipient of at least ten of the pieces. These artworks bear provenance statements on their verso and appear to have been given to the superintendent in 1917 by John Keirn, a teacher at the Moencopi (Hopi) Day School. The ten works were part of a series of drawings by Grade II and Grade III pupils. Only the first name of the artist was recorded.</p>
         <p>An appendix, which indexes the artworks by artist name, has been created to aid researchers using the collection. In both the box and folder listing and the appendix, artists with a traditional Indian name and a name in the European tradition have been listed under the name they preferred to use. When known but not preferred, traditional names have been listed in parentheses after an entry.</p>

               <p>The artworks, which are mainly gouache and watercolor, include pencil, crayon, and ink sketches. Where possible, titles for works have been transcribed. In cases where no caption was present, a description of the work has been supplied in brackets by the processing archivist or student assistant. Thirteen of the pieces in the collection contain art on the recto and verso of a single sheet, or are multiple works on a single sheet; titles are noted or supplied for both images. Rounded dimensions (h x w) for the unmatted art works are also provided. At the end of each description statement, a number indicates the sequence of the item in earlier finding aids.</p>
               <p>A listing of the works, indexed by artist name, follows the box and folder listing.</p>
