         <head>RALPH HODGSON (1871-1962)</head>
         <p>Ralph Hodgson, British poet, was born September 9, 1871 in Darlington, England. Very little is known about his early life. He joined the Navy at the beginning of World War I, and later was commissioned into the Royal Artillery. After his first wife Janet Chatteris died in 1920, he married Muriel Fraser and left England in 1924, accepting an invitation to teach English at Sendai University in Japan. He divorced Muriel in 1932, and the next year married Aurelia Bolliger, who was a mission school teacher in Japan. In 1938 Hodgson left Japan and retired to live in the United States, where Aurelia had been born. They purchased a farm outside of Minerva, Ohio, near Canton, and apart from giving a few lectures and workshops around the country in the 1940s, Hodgson lived out the remaining years of his life in Ohio. His health began to fail in the 1950s, and he died in November 1962.</p>
         <p>Hodgson's first book of poems, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Last Blackbird and Other Lines
            </title>, was published in 1907. In 1913 he founded, with Claud Lovat Fraser and Holbrook Jackson, a private press named "At the Sign of the Flying Fame," which published his poems as chapbooks and broadsides. These poems included those on which his reputation was based: "The Bull," "The Song of Honour," and "Eve." In 1917 these poems and others were gathered in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Poems
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Though his published output was limited, in the years following the publication of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Poems
            </title> Hodgson was a well-known and respected poet. During his time in Japan his poetic production slowed down, but once he moved to Ohio he began to write again. He published a series of broadsides entitled "Flying Scrolls" between 1941 and 1951 at the Boerner Printing Company in Minerva, Ohio. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Skylark and Other Poems
            </title> was published in 1954, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Collected Poems
            </title> in 1961. In 1914 Hodgson won the Polignac prize for "The Song of Honour," and in 1938 he was awarded the insignia of the Rising Sun. He was recognized for distinguished achievement from the American Academy and the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1946, and received the Queen's gold medal for poetry in 1954. Through the years Hodgson numbered many other writers of the day among his friends, including Siegfried Sassoon, T. S. Eliot, and Walter de la Mare.</p>
         <p>Beyond his literary career, Hodgson had wide-ranging interests, which included boxing; he is said to have run away from school to join the boxing world for a time. He was also an artist, and while still a young man traveled to the United States and worked as an assistant scene painter in New York City's Thalia Theater. He worked in London as an artist for several different newspapers and magazines, signing some of his works 'Yorick.' He became art editor of C. B. Fry's <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Weekly Magazine of Sport and Outdoor Life
            </title> in 1912. He was drawn to the outdoors and to animals, particularly birds and dogs (and especially bull terriers). In 1920, Hodgson inspired the campaign against the trafficking in birds' feathers for women's apparel, which resulted in the Plumage Act of 1921. He was also fascinated by English history and topography, and was a collector of books and maps on that subject. A calling card made by Sassoon for Hodgson humorously sums up this versatile man's many interests: "Mr. Ralph Hodgson, Minerva, Ohio. Birds watched and bull terriers taken in free of charge. Pugilism. Snooker. Poetry. Dog Fancier. Telegrams. 'Cruftitude.'"</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Ralph Hodgson Papers consist of correspondence, writings, artwork, photographs, and printed material which document the life of the English poet Ralph Hodgson. The collection spans the years 1695-1976, but most of the material dates from the period of Ralph Hodgson's adult life and the years just after his death, 1914-1970. The papers also provide insight into the lives and work of the many other writers of this period with whom he corresponded. Siegfried Sassoon is particularly well represented in the collection, by correspondence, writings, artwork, photographs, and printed material. Sassoon was known for his antiwar poetry while still serving in the Army during World War I, and became close friends with Hodgson before Hodgson moved to Japan. In the following decades he wrote novels and autobiographical works as well, and dedicated <title type="simple" render="italic">

                  Correspondence
               </title> 
            </ref>, 1887-1976 (boxes 1-39), which consists of letters to and from Ralph Hodgson, has been organized into eight subseries: Personal Correspondence, Third Party Correspondence, Permissions, Publishers Inquiries, Orders, Other Requests and Invitations, Fan Mail, and Related Material. The subseries are all arranged alphabetically except for Orders and Fan Mail, which are arranged chronologically.</p>
         <p>Personal Correspondence consists of letters to Ralph Hodgson, carbon copies of typewritten letters written by Hodgson, manuscript drafts of letters by Hodgson, and letters to Aurelia Hodgson from others. Ralph's principal correspondents include Enid Bagnold, Silvia Baker, Edmund Blunden, Bryher, T. S. Eliot, Norman Holmes Pearson, I. A. Richards, Siegfried Sassoon, Dorothy Hall Smith, and W. Bevan Whitney. Correspondence for those with more than ten folders of material is listed at a finer level for easier retrieval.</p>
         <p>The correspondence reflects Hodgson's wide ranging interests and friendships. Topics addressed in the letters include poetry; prominent authors and their works; advice to aspiring writers; dogs, especially bull terriers, and information on their breeding; first hand accounts by friends serving as soldiers and nurses in the first World War; and plans for visits and writers' seminars. A number of people introduced themselves to Hodgson by mail because of a shared interest; quite often a friendship through the mail ensued. Very little family correspondence is present; what there is comes from nephews and nieces: Enid Hodgson, Robert Hodgson, Shirley Colquhoun, and "Wog" de la Force. In 1933 Ralph married Aurelia Bolliger (whose nickname was "Weg"), and starting in 1932 the correspondence contains letters to the both of them and also to her alone. There is only one piece of correspondence between Aurelia and Ralph, a telegram from 1955 in which Ralph instructed Aurelia to decline an invitation.</p>
         <p>The early correspondence contains very few drafts of letters written by Hodgson, as it was only in the 1940s that he began to keep carbon copies of typewritten letters he had written to friends. When Hodgson moved to Japan, one result was that letters written to him there were often meant to keep him in touch with the literary life that he had left behind in England. These letters tend to be lengthier and contain enclosures of writings, photographs, and newspaper clippings. These enclosures have been kept with the letters they accompanied. Appropriate cross-references have been made in related series.</p>
         <p>Though he rarely left his Ohio farm after the 1940s, Hodgson still carried on an active correspondence. Carbon copies of his typewritten letters appear consistently in the files from 1950. In the late 1950s, Aurelia took to writing Ralph's letters for him; these are usually typewritten, and there are often notes in Ralph's hand on the letters he received highlighting important points to include in an answer. Many of the letters written by the Hodgsons in the late 1950s and early 1960s provide information on the state of Ralph's health. After his death, Aurelia attempted to organize the correspondence. Her notes on the contents of some letters and a few 'see' references that she wrote on slips of paper are to be found in box 39.</p>
         <p>The correspondence documents the extended network of friends and professional contacts Hodgson established as he moved from England to Japan to the United States. While Hodgson lived in England he corresponded with other English poets and authors of the time, including Claude Colleer Abbott, Enid Bagnold, Edmund Blunden, John Cournos, W. H. Davies, Walter de la Mare, John Drinkwater, John Galsworthy, Francis Meynell, Alida Monro, Siegfried Sassoon, Theodore Spicer-Simson, James Stephens, and Charles Walston. Letters received from those serving in the first World War include Enid Bagnold, Lovat Fraser, Lettice Low, and "Old Dor," an army chaplain whose last name was Dorling.</p>
         <p>In Japan, Hodgson established friendships and professional ties with a number of professors and authors, including Kochi Doi, Atsuo Kobayashi, and Torao and Yoshi Taketomo, who wrote to him after he left. European correspondents in the collection whose letters first appear while Hodgson lived in Japan (1924-1938) include: Silvia Baker, T. S. Eliot, Vivienne Eliot, William Empson, Mark Gertler, Holbrook Jackson, Samuel Koteliansky, F. V. Morley, I. A. Richards, Henry Salt, and Laurence Whistler.</p>
         <p>Similarly, when he moved to the United States, Hodgson made new contacts and established a particularly close relationship with nearby students, faculty, and staff at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio. During these years Hodgson corresponded regularly with such people as Seymour Adelman of the University of Pennsylvania, Gordon Chalmers of Kenyon College, Eric Eckler of Mount Union College, Norman Holmes Pearson of Yale University, and students Laura Rankin of Mount Union College, and Dorothy Hall Smith, who met Hodgson at a seminar in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
         <p>Other correspondents from this time include Bryher, introduced by Norman Holmes Pearson; Witter Bynner, Valerie Eliot, who included photocopies of letters from Hodgson to T. S. Eliot in her later letters (folder 1132); Colin Fenton; Henry Leach, to whom Hodgson wrote about their common interests and his life in Ohio; John Masefield; Wesley D. Sweetser, and W. Bevan Whitney.</p>
         <p>The correspondence with Siegfried Sassoon is the most extensive in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Correspondence
            </title> series, dating from 1923 to 1963 (folders 467-491). In his letters, Sassoon writes about his personal life, other writers, and his own works. Following the personal correspondence in Series I, there are two folders of typed transcripts of the correspondence from 1923-1934, typed by Aurelia Hodgson. In his letters to Hodgson, Sassoon mentions sending under separate cover manuscripts of poems, galleys, page proofs, and photographs, many of which are to be found in Series VI, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Siegfried Sassoon Collection
            </title>. In the Third Party Correspondence section of the series there are three additional letters written to Sassoon.</p>
         <p>Finally, there is a small group of letters written congratulating Ralph Hodgson on his 90th birthday in 1961, which have been kept together rather than separated according to correspondent (folders 619-622). Norman Holmes Pearson, Yale professor and a good friend of Hodgson, organized a birthday celebration, encouraged old friends and living poets to write to Hodgson on his birthday. He also solicited poetry from them, which he gathered, typed, and presented to Ralph (folder 878). Congratulatory letters from the following individuals are present: Conrad Aiken, W. H. Auden, Van Wyck Brooks, Bryher, Witter Bynner, Melville Cane, C. Day Lewis, Kochi Doi, Richard Eberhart, T. S. Eliot, Colin Fenton, Robert Graves, Donald Hall, Cecil Hemley, John Holmes, President John F. Kennedy, Atsuo Kobayashi, Denise Levertov, Robert Lowell, Daniel Macmillan, John Masefield, William Meredith, Marianne Moore, Royal Murdoch, Kyoko Ohara, Norman Holmes Pearson, Henry Rago, Takeshi Saito, Winfield Townley Scott, Stephen Spender, Shinji Takuwa, Allen Tate, Mark Van Doren, Robert Penn Warren, Glenway Wescott, John Hall Wheelock, W. Bevan Whitney, Richard Wilbur, William Carlos Williams, Yvor Winters, and Sir Douglas Young. Hodgson was particularly impressed by President Kennedy's letter of congratulations, and he had photocopies of the letter made and sent to several friends. Both the original letter and Hodgson's photocopies are present in the file.</p>
         <p>The other correspondence subseries are less extensive. Mail in these categories from personal friends has been placed in Personal Correspondence. Permissions includes requests to quote his poetry or set his poems to music, and Publishers Inquiries consists of offers to publish his poems or solicitations for new poems. The Orders pertain to the Flying Scroll broadsides that Hodgson published between 1941-1951. Other Requests and Invitations contains a miscellany of requests for interviews, invitations to speak and to read his poetry, pose for photographs, etc. The Fan Mail is arranged chronologically; as with the other correspondence subseries, some files include copies of Hodgson's replies.</p>

         <p>Writings by Ralph Hodgson includes typescripts, page proofs, galleys, and photocopies. While there appear to be no complete holographs of his published poems present in the collection, the two folders of holograph fragments may contain parts of them, as well as unpublished poems. There are a number of photocopies of magazine articles that Hodgson wrote in the early nineteen-teens, and a couple of typescript drafts of "Memories of Poets, 1910-1920," later published as <title type="simple" render="italic">

The subseries also includes a series of fifty-nine cartoons in pen-and-ink and crayon with references to Joyce, Pound, and Eliot (folders 1168-1188); two drawings dating from his years in Japan: Ainu chief and his son, and Tomi San, a drawing of a Japanese girl; and sketches of birds, dogs, landscapes, and people. A broadside, "Love Me, Love My Dog," which depicts famous authors and their recorded remarks about dogs, was published as the endpapers to <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <p>Artwork by Others includes a large number of clipped illustrations and cartoons by W. G. Baxter, F. A. Fraser, Forain and others, which Hodgson apparently used as study prints. There are sketches of Hodgson by Arata Endo and Jiyu Gakuen, and a photocopy of a drawing by Kikuo Kojima. There is also a self-portrait in colored pencil by George William Russell (folder 914).</p>

               </title> 
            </ref>, 1695-1975 (boxes 46-58), is organized into four subseries: Pamphlets, Maps, Clippings, and Other Printed Material. Pamphlets and Maps are arranged alphabetically by author, or by title if the author is unknown. Many of the pamphlets originally accompanied correspondence; these remain housed with the correspondence. Appropriate cross-references have been made in the listing. The pamphlets include the text of Masefield's presentation of the Polignac prize to Hodgson (folder 262), a printing of "Time, You Old Gypsy Man" by Reinold and Hannie Kuipers-Verwey, and an article by Ralph L. Schroeder about Hodgson. A group of five bound volumes of pamphlets contains book chapters and clippings on particular topics of interest to Hodgson, including illustrators and caricaturists, Londoniana, and poetical criticism. Also included are a large number of maps of Great Britain, many of them ordnance maps, used by Hodgson as part of his study of the history of Great Britain. These maps date predominantly from the 19th and 20th centuries. There is also a map of Japanese railways from 1913, and an undated map of China. There are several boxes of clippings, which are arranged by subject.</p>
