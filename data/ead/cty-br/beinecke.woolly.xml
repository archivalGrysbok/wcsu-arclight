         <p>The Press of the Woolly Whale was in operation in New York City from 1928 to 1942, during which time it produced private and limited edition volumes, publications related to printing and typographic arts, and a wide variety of ephemera that reflected the interests, professional relationships, and personal humor of Melbert Brinkerhoff Cary Jr., his wife Mary Flagler Cary, and their friends. While Cary directed the press's efforts, he employed George W. Van Vechten Jr. for typesetting and press work. Two exhibitions profiled the press's achievements (Grosvenor Library, Buffalo, New York, in 1939, and Rochester Institute of Technology in 1972); the catalogs from those exhibitions contained bibliographies which were superseded by David Pankow's checklist in <title type="simple" render="italic">

         <head>Melbert B. Cary Jr. and Mary Flagler Cary</head>
         <p>Melbert Brinkerhoff Cary Jr. (1892-1941), a New York businessman and prominent figure in the fields of typography and private printing during the second quarter of the twentieth century, was born in New York, the son of Melbert and Julia Metcalf Cary. Educated at the Groton School and Yale University (Class of 1916), he served in France with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I. Cary was the director of the Continental Typefounders Association, Inc., which he organized in New York City in 1925 to import from Europe the best new designs in type, initials, borders, and ornaments being developed by foundries on the continent, but cast to American type height and using the American point system so that designers and printers in the United States could use fresh and modern faces for commercial advertising.</p>
         <p>In 1923 Cary married Mary Harkness Flagler (1901-1967), the daughter of Anne Lamont and Harry Harkness Flagler, and the granddaughter of Henry Morrison Flagler, one of the founders of the Standard Oil Company. She was raised in New York City and in Millbrook, New York, where the Carys continued to maintain homes after their marriage. Melbert Cary Jr. served as president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, was proprietor of the private Press of the Woolly Whale, and a collector of printer's manuals and type specimens, great books of the printer's art, and rare playing cards; he acquired the Kelmscott/Goudy Press (Albion No. 6551) on which William Morris had printed <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Works of Geoffrey Chauce
            </title>r (1896), from Frederic W. Goudy in 1932. Mary Flagler Cary was the president of the National Orchestral Association and a collector of rare manuscript music.</p>

         <p>George W. Van Vechten Jr., American printer, typographer, and book designer, was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, attended Carnegie Institute of Technology, and died in Metuchen, New Jersey, in 1962, at age 55. He produced private and limited edition works for thirty-five years with Frederic W. Goudy at the Village Press, with Melbert B. Cary Jr. at the Press of the Woolly Whale, and from 1941 to 1962 at his own Van Vechten Press in Metuchen. Van Vechten inherited the Kelmscott/Goudy Press (Albion No. 6551) upon Cary's death in 1941.</p>

         <p>The records primarily consist of correspondence and production files related to work created at the Press of the Woolly Whale, including original and carbon typescripts, corrected page proofs and galleys, paper samples, title page and endpaper designs, dummies, notes, and receipts.

In addition, the records contain the press's archival set of Woolly Whale publications including ephemeral items such as prospectuses, invitations, broadsides, holiday cards, mailing labels, and certificates, as well as four chronologically arranged scrapbooks created by Cary to hold samples of small ephemera, reviews of the press's work, and other related clippings. Many of the Woolly Whale publications were produced as holiday, anniversary, and birthday greetings, and tributes to respected colleagues, particularly Frederic W. Goudy. A military veteran, Cary issued annual tributes to Armistice Day beginning in 1928 ranging in format from a simple broadside to a set of playing cards, <title type="simple" render="italic">

               <p>The series contains four volumes of scrapbooks, specially bound in stamped calf and enclosed in titled slipcases, that were created to hold material by and about the Press of the Woolly Whale. Each contains samples of printed ephemera produced by the press such as stationery, invitations, luggage tags, mailing labels, postcards, and pamphlets, as well as clippings from newspapers and trade journals regarding publications of the press. A fifth scrapbook had a detached spine and front cover, and no slipcase; the material within had only been laid in between the first few pages in the front of the volume so it was removed and foldered, and the scrapbook discarded. Additional copies of material found in the scrapbooks may also appear in Series IV, Press of the Woolly Whale Publications.</p>

               <p>The series contains files related to the production of publications issued by the press, including correspondence, notes, original artwork, paper samples, dummies, mechanicals, and proofs. As the projects were primarily of Cary's own creation few of the files contain correspondence, but there are exceptions. Two such publications are (41) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Mademoiselle from Armentieres
                  </title>, vol. II, and (47) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Estivation of Two Mao Tzu
                  </title> which both have correspondence and research materials. The first contains versions of the songs Cary collected from veterans and others, correspondence with Robert Winslow Gordon of the Library of Congress Music Division's Archive of Folk Song, and an article Cary published in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Journal of American Folklore
                  </title> 47 (1934); the second has correspondence with scholar Chi-Chen Wang and with Carroll T. Harris, Cary's typesetter for the book. Many of the files hold original drawings used for illustrations, particularly the work of Alban Butler Jr., and the files for (37) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Some Thoughts on the Ornamented Mss. of the Middle Ages
                  </title> contain multiple photographs by Arnold Genthe of the Kelmscott/Goudy Press (Albion No. 6551) plus Warren Chappell's drawing after one of those images.</p>
               <p>The projects are arranged by the checklist number established in David Pankow's annotated bibliography <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Melbert B. Cary, Jr. and the Press of the Woolly Whale
                  </title> (2002), which is arranged chronologically. There is not a file for every project; numbers in brackets indicate the items that do not appear in the bibliography. Filed at the end of the series is work accomplished for organizations with which the Carys were closely involved, projects contemplated but not completed, and unidentified artwork.</p>

               <p>Series IV is arranged chronologically.</p>
               <p>The series primarily contains publications, both volumes and ephemera, that were produced at the Press of the Woolly Whale. Most of the volumes were labeled "Press Copy," though also kept here are copies created with special papers, inks, coloring, or variant bindings, and some with slipcases or bespoke containers. Exemplars, among others are: (57)<title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Ninth Man
                  </title>, hand-colored by Fritz Kredel; (96) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Gutenberg and the Strasbourg Documents of 1439
                  </title>, bound by Gerhard Gerlach; (98) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Missing Gutenberg Wooden Blocks
                  </title>, bound by Peter Franck; (16) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     And It Came to Pass
                  </title>, a small Christmas greeting bound by Otto Fratzscher; and (37) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Some Thoughts on the Ornamented Mss. of the Middle Ages
                  </title>, by William Morris, for which there are copies bound by six different binders. One copy of (28) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht: A Christmas Song
                  </title> is annoted "This is the only copy composed of untreated sheets. All others have been dipped in coffee after printing." There are also are special association copies signed by the authors or others, including (21) <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Sentimental Bloke
                  </title>, by C. J. Dennis, which was inscribed by Cary using his family nickname: "for Mary -- to whom the original Sentimental Bloke was sent way back in 1922. Mike."</p>
               <p>The publications are arranged by the checklist number established in David Pankow's annotated bibliography <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Melbert B. Cary, Jr. and the Press of the Woolly Whale
                  </title> (2002), which is arranged chronologically; numbers in brackets indicate the items that do not appear in the bibliography. Copies of ephemeral items can also be found in Series II, Scrapbooks. Filed at the end of the series is work accomplished for organizations with which the Carys were closely involved; after Cary became president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) the press printed several ephemeral publications for the group.</p>
               <p>The copies of publications in this series are not recorded in Orbis, the library's online catalog.</p>
