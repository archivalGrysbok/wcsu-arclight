         <abstract id="aspace_de621e73b2c55a251b563ff7217ee8a6">The John Betjeman collection documents the personal and professional life of John Betjeman between 1908 and 1990, with the bulk of material dating between 1936 and 1984. The collection provides evidence of Betjeman's career as a writer and broadcaster and consists of correspondence, writings, personal papers, newspaper clippings, audiovisual materials, and a small number of candid photographs. The collection traces Betjeman's creative process through initial scribblings in his notebooks to more formal drafts and the publishing process (as found in galleys and correspondence with editors and publishers). A substantial volume of the correspondence is from Betjeman to his wife Penelope Chetwode and provides insight into their relationship. More broadly, owing to Betjeman's role as Poet Laureate and connection with various authors, the collection is a window into literary life in Britain during the twentieth century. The majority of the collection is comprised of the Duncan Andrews Collection of John Betjeman.</abstract>

         <head>John Betjeman (1906-1984)</head>
         <p>John Betjeman was a British poet, writer, and broadcaster. Poet laureate between 1972 and his death in 1984, Betjeman became a household name through his accessible poetry and appearances on radio and television.</p>
         <p>Born in north London to Ernest Edward Betjeman and Mabel Bessie Dawson, Betjeman attended Byron House Montessori School and Highgate junior school (where he was taught by T.S. Eliot) before enrolling in Dragon School and Marlborough College, Oxford, in 1917. Betjeman then attended Magdalen College, University of Oxford (1925-1928), where he was tutored by C.S. Lewis and joined a cohort of other creative-minded students consisting of Evelyn Waugh, Osbert Lancaster, W.H. Auden, Tom Driberg, Edward James, and George Alfred Kolkhorst. Betjeman left Oxford without obtaining a degree, under the pretence of having failed divinity; he rejected joining his father's furniture manufacturing business, and instead dabbled in a series of positions ranging from insurance broker to cricket instructor and English teacher.</p>
         <p>In the 1930s Betjeman's writing career began in earnest, as demonstrated by the publication of his first books, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Mount Zion
            </title> (1931), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Ghastly Good Taste
            </title> (1933), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Continual Dew
            </title> (1937), and his employment as the assistant editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Architectural Review
            </title> (1930-33) and film critic for the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Evening Standard
            </title> (1933-34). Betjeman also wrote and edited a series of guides on British counties for Shell during the mid-1930s. This period was also eventful in Betjeman's personal life, marking his marriage to Penelope Valentine Hester Chetwode (1910-1986) in 1933, their move to Garrard's Farm, Uffington, Berkshire and the birth of their first child, Paul, in 1937. That same year Betjeman became a member of the Church of England, after a period of experimenting with different faiths.</p>
         <p>With the outbreak of the Second World War Betjeman unsuccessfully tried to join the Royal Air Force, and instead served as a press attaché for the United Kingdom in Dublin, Ireland from 1941 to 1942. He then returned to England where he worked for the British Admiralty (1944) and the British Council's Books Department (1944-1946). Betjeman continued to publish during this period, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Old Lights for New Chancels
            </title> (1940) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Bats in Old Belfries
            </title> (1945).</p>
         <p>Upon returning to England, Betjeman and his family, which now included their daughter Candida (born in 1942), moved to Farnborough and then to Wantage where Chetwode opened a teashop called King Alfred's Kitchen. Chetwode's conversion to Roman Catholicism and Betjeman's relationship with Elizabeth Cavendish caused a rupture in the couple's marriage. And while Betjeman and Chetwode stayed married and deeply connected throughout their lives, they agreed to separate.</p>
         <p>Betjeman's publications during the 1950s, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Few Late Chrysanthemums
            </title> (1954) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Collected Poems
            </title> (1958), reflect his exploration of themes touched on in his earlier works: an interest in Victorian and provincial architecture, a nostalgia for the past, and religiosity, among others. <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Collected Poems
            </title>was popular with critics and the public alike, and helped establish Betjeman's reputation, which was further cemented with <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Summoned by Bells
            </title> (1960), an autobiographical account of his early student life and teaching days. While perhaps not as widely read as these works, Betjeman's later writings, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               High and Low
            </title> (1966), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Nip in the Air
            </title> (1974), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Collected Poems
            </title>(1979) were met with pleasure by an audience already devoted to his poetry.</p>
         <p>During this period Betjeman received several awards, including the Foyle Poetry Prize (1955 and 1959), the Russell Loins Memorial Fund (1956), Duff Cooper Prize (1959), and the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry (1960). Betjeman was also declared Commander, Order of the British Empire (1960) and knighted (1969).</p>
         <p>By this time Betjeman was also a beloved radio and television personality. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that his appointment as Poet Laureate in 1972 was much celebrated. While not all of Betjeman's poems written in this capacity were well received, as demonstrated in the criticisms of his hymn for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee, by this point Betjeman had reached celebrity status and was a figure of intense interest and scrutiny.</p>
         <p>During the mid-seventies Betjeman was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. However, he continued to write, publish, and appear on television. One of the last poetry compilations that he published in his lifetime includes <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Uncollected Poems
            </title> (1982), which brings together a collection of poems omitted from earlier publications. In addition to his regular programs on radio and television, Betjeman also created a number of television documentaries in the mid- to late-seventies: <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Metro-Land
            </title>(1973), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               A Passion for Churches
            </title> (1974), <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Vicar of This Parish
            </title> (1976), and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Betjeman's Dublin
            </title> (1979).</p>
         <p>After a series of strokes and further deterioration due to Parkinson's, Betjeman died on May 19, 1984.</p>
         <p>Penelope Chetwode published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Two Middle-Aged Ladies in Andalusia
            </title> (1963) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Kulu: The End of the Habitable World
            </title> (1972), as well as a series of articles. She was born in 1910 to Field Marshal Sir Philip Walhouse Chetwode (first Baron Chetwode) and Lady Alice Hester Camilla Chetwode (née Cotton). Having lived in India while her father served there as Commander-in-Chief, she maintained a lifelong interest in Indian culture and architecture. In fact, Chetwode initially met Betjeman when she submitted an article on the archaeological site Ellora (Maharashtra, India) to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Architectural Review
            </title>at the recommendation of Robert Byron. Throughout her life, Chetwode researched and wrote about Indian architecture and traveled there frequently (often leading tours). She died in the Himalayas in 1986.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The John Betjeman Collection documents the personal and professional life of John Betjeman between 1908 and 1990, with the bulk of material dating between 1936 and 1984. The collection provides evidence of Betjeman's career as a writer and broadcaster and consists of correspondence, writings, personal papers, newspaper clippings, audiovisual materials, and a small number of candid photographs. A substantial volume of the correspondence is from Betjeman to his wife Penelope Chetwode and provides insight into their relationship. More broadly, owing to Betjeman's role as Poet Laureate and connection with various authors, the collection is a window into literary life in Britain during the twentieth-century.</p>
         <p>Betjeman's writing career, as a poet, reviewer, and prose author, is chronicled in the collection. Most notably, the collection traces Betjeman's creative process through initial scribblings in his notebooks to more formal drafts and then the publishing process found in galleys and correspondence with editors and publishers. Since Betjeman often doodled, annotated, and commented on his early drafts these are rich documents of his creativity at work. A number of Betjeman's well-known poetry publications are represented in the collection, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Church Poems
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Summoned by Bells
            </title>, and<title type="simple" render="italic">
               New Bats in Old Belfries
            </title>. Betjeman's correspondence chronicles his literary life and acquaintances. For example, in a letter to the journalist Thomas Driberg he discusses his interest in the poet laureateship (May 18, 1969) and in his correspondence with the poet Siegfried Sassoon he explains his approach to reading and analyzing poetry. Numerous clippings provide a sense of Betjeman's public life as poet laureate, such as celebrations and criticisms of his poetry, inquiries into his private life, and more mundane observations, such as his astrological sign and birthday wishes. Ephemera from the Betjeman-inspired production "Betjemania" and menu and matchbook from the "Betjeman Carving Restaurant" further capture his presence as a public figure.</p>
         <p>In addition to his poetry, the collection also provides evidence of Betjeman's writings on architecture. His work for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Architectural Review
            </title> and his book-length publications such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Ghastly Good Taste
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The City of London Churches
            </title> attest to his lifelong passion for architecture (particularly buildings of Victorian and provincial design). In addition to drafts for these publications, Betjeman's sketchbook is full of drawings of various buildings (especially churches), which were often later used in print. Betjeman fought to save a number of buildings from destruction through his writings, broadcast work, appearances at fundraisers, and by lending his name to various campaigns. The collection contains an assortment of publications resulting from this work as well as a number of newspaper clippings following Betjeman's involvement in conservation work, whether successful (as in St. Pancras Station) or unsuccessful (Euston Arch).</p>
         <p>The collection also includes a few scripts from Betjeman's work in broadcasting as well as several recordings of his radio and television appearances. The majority of the recordings are reel-to-reel audio tapes, although the collection does contain some film and video. As the recordings demonstrate, Betjeman's work in the media industry was predominantly with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Betjeman's radio and television programs reflect his interests in poetry, architecture/urban development, and religion, as his series "Choirs and the Places Where They Sing" and "Three in Hand: Three Churches" illustrate. In addition to the scripts and recordings, the collection contains newspaper clippings reflecting Betjeman's various projects, including his documentary <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Metroland
            </title>.</p>
         <p>The majority of the collection is comprised of the Duncan Andrews Collection of John Betjeman. Duncan Andrews, of New York, began collecting Betjeman material during the 1950s, and shortly thereafter met both Betjeman and Chetwode. The collection contains items reflecting Andrews's role as a collector, such as his correspondence and printed material, which provide insight into the collecting process and the personality behind the project. Andrews's relationship with Betjeman, Chetwode, their children, book dealers, scholars, and his work to create a bibliography (achieved later by William S. Peterson) can be traced through the correspondence. As Betjeman began to suffer from Parkinson's disease and struggled to maintain his correspondence as Poet Laureate, Andrews replied to letters on Betjeman's behalf. Andrews's willingness to provide researchers with access to the collection and to pull together exhibits is documented. Notes in Andrews's hand throughout the collection further demonstrate his effort to build the collection and to ensure its cohesion for future researchers.</p>

               <p>The series is organized into two subseries: John Betjeman Correspondence and Duncan Andrews Correspondence. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by name of the writer or addressee of the letter.</p>
            </arrangement>
            <scopecontent id="aspace_614829a2d51764ccd21326fce8748d6b">
               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The John Betjeman Correspondence largely consists of his outgoing correspondence to colleagues, friends, and family between 1936 and 1984. The majority of the correspondence is from Betjeman to his wife Penelope Chetwode between 1942 and 1981. These letters provide insight into the complexities of their relationship and, in spite of their separation and Betjeman's relationship with Elizabeth Cavendish, the deep respect they maintained for each other throughout their lives. Often written in an imitation-cockney and childish accent, Betjeman's letters to Chetwode, or "Plymmie," discuss family members (such as their children Paul and Candida, or "Wibz"), friends, and colleagues and are a window into the couple's personal and professional lives. Other family members represented in the correspondence are his mother Mable Betjeman and Aunt Elsie Avril. Avril's correspondence includes a photograph of Betjeman as a child with his teddy bear Archibald.</p>
               <p>Although smaller in number, Betjeman's correspondence with his colleagues helps illuminate his social and literary milieu, which are represented here by publishers John G. Murray and Martin Secker; authors Siegfried Sassoon, Richard Buckle, Thomas Driberg, John Hayward, Beverley Nichols, and Alan John Ross; and artists Nicolas Bentley and Eric de Maré. The correspondence also contains letters from Betjeman's former tutor C. S. Lewis, in which Lewis openly discusses the history of their acrimonious relationship, apparently stimulated by Betjeman's request to make amends. Betjeman's advice to aspiring poets and opinions on poetry can be found in his General "A-Z" correspondence and letters to fellow authors.</p>
               <p>Betjeman often decorated his letters with illustrations. The letters also demonstrate Betjeman's deterioration due to Parkinson's disease during the latter years of his life, which significantly curbed his ability to maintain correspondence without the aid of a secretary.</p>
               <p>The Duncan Andrews Correspondence contains his communications with John Betjeman and Penelope Chetwode as well as book dealers, scholars, and others regarding his Betjeman collection. The correspondence also includes Andrews's interactions with William S. Peterson (author of John Betjeman: A Bibliography) and others regarding his Betjeman bibliography in addition to notes and a draft for the bibliography. Earlier attempts at compiling a bibliography can be found in Betjeman's correspondence with Geoffrey Handley-Taylor. Also included is correspondence documenting Andrews' work with Wellesley College for an exhibit on Betjeman.</p>

               <p>The series is organized into nine subseries: Major Works; Single Poems; Essays and Articles; Broadcast Scripts; Reviews; Other Writings; Notebooks; Publicity; and Writings of Others.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Writings, which are comprised of drafts, proofs, published versions, and reviews, reflect Betjeman's career as a poet as well as his work in radio and television. The writings contain Betjeman's work throughout the creative process, and occasionally a piece can be traced from its origins in a notebook, to later drafts, published versions, and consequent reviews.</p>
               <p>Betjeman's poetry is located in the Major Works and Single Poems subseries (the latter contains individual poems, some of which were eventually compiled into book-length publications). A number of drafts and proofs for Betjeman's poetry collections, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Church Poems
                  </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Summoned by Bells
                  </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     New Bats in Old Belfries
                  </title>, are included in the collection, and are often annotated in the author's hand. Betjeman's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Ground Plan to Skyline
                  </title>, which he published under the pseudonym Richard M. Farran, also incorporates correspondence explaining the circumstances around the publication and Betjeman's frustration with the project. Betjeman often decorated his drafts with illustrations, such as his poem beginning with the lines "My four footed friends, they bark all night" with doodles of the dogs described therein.</p>
               <p>Themes explored in Betjeman's poetry, such as religion and architecture, also pervade his essays and media work. For example, among Betjeman's essays and articles are his <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The City of London Churches
                  </title> and series on London neighbourhoods "Ballet-Goer's London Guide" published with illustrations by David Thomas in <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Ballet
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Broadcast scripts concern Betjeman's work in radio and television, the recordings for which can be found in the Audiovisual Series. The scripts include Betjeman's own series, such as BBC's "Buildings and Places" and "Three in Hand," in addition to programs on which Betjeman was interviewed or which included his poetry.</p>
               <p>The Reviews subseries contains Betjeman's reviews of other authors for various magazines. Betjeman's Other Writings vary from his farcical magazine "The DOOGG Weekly," written for Penelope Chetwode, to a translation and various introductions. The subseries Writings of Others include derivatives of Betjeman's work and biographies and criticism of the author.</p>

               <p>Personal papers contains photographs of Betjeman as well as other personal items, such as sketchbooks, a diary, and other ephemera. The photographs are mostly candid snapshots, although the series includes some formal portraits of Betjeman. Family and friends are also captured in the photographs, which portray the Betjemans while in Ireland and in old age, as well as a playful shot from Osbert Lancaster's sixtieth birthday party.</p>
               <p>Betjeman's sketchbook and loose drawings capture various churches, homes, landscapes, and streetscapes, mostly in pen and ink. Betjeman drew people less frequently, although his sketches here include caricatures of George Alfred Kolkhorst, or "Colonel" Kolkhorst from Betjeman's Oxford days. Betjeman's diary for 1954 is a mix of professional and personal responsibilities, ranging from meetings and BBC recordings to notes about his children's comings and goings.</p>

               <p>The series is organized into three subseries: Clippings; Booklets, Brochures, and Pamphlets; and Material Collected by Duncan Andrews. The clippings are arranged in chronological order. Prior to processing some clippings were grouped into various subjects, which are retained here and arranged alphabetically by topic.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains publications about Betjeman and his family, namely clippings, pamphlets, brochures, and booklets, dating from 1946 to 1990. The majority of the printed material consists of clippings obtained by Duncan Andrews through a news clippings service, largely during the 1970s, and concerns Betjeman's work as a preservationist.</p>
               <p>The subseries Pamphlets, Brochures, and Booklets includes ephemera relating to events in which Betjeman participated, varying from readings to fundraisers for churches. Programs from memorial services held in Betjeman's honour following his death in 1984 are also found in the subseries.</p>
               <p>Other Printed Material Collected by Duncan Andrews pertains to Andrews's work in creating and promoting his John Betjeman collection (for instance, exhibition and book dealers' catalogues). Ephemera removed from Andrews's book collection – such as printed ephemera and correspondence – is also located in this subseries. Andrews's book collection contained his own books and some formerly belonging to Betjeman. The book from which individual items were removed is recorded with each item.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is comprised of audiovisual recordings, encompassing reel-to-reel sound recordings as well as film and VHS videotapes, which capture Betjeman's radio and television appearances. This work is of interest since it is largely through this medium that he became a household name.</p>
               <p>The majority of the recordings were made in the 1960s and 1970s, although some recordings are from an earlier period, the earliest dating from 1936 (this being Betjeman's broadcast for BBC's "West Country Calendar" on "May Games or Matter for a May Morning"). While the recordings largely document Betjeman's work with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the series includes one sound recording from his personal life, possibly of a visit of Andrews with Betjeman and Chetwode.</p>
               <p>In his radio work Betjeman read his own poetry and that of others as well as conducting interviews and investigations into topics such as architecture, religion, and literature. Among the television programmes in the collection are Betjeman's series for BBC such as "Four With Betjeman" in which he discusses a set of Victorian architects and "Bird's-Eye View" in which Betjeman explores England by helicopter. Betjeman's appearances on other programmes are also represented in the recordings; for example, his radio interview by teenagers on BBC's "Let's Find Out." The majority of Betjeman's television work is documented through audio recordings.</p>
