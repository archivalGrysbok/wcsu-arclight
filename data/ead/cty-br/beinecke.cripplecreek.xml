         <head>History of the Cripple Creek Region, Colorado</head>
         <p>The Cripple Creek Region encompasses land surrounding the communities of Cripple Creek and Victor in Colorado, southwest of Colorado Springs near the base of Pikes Peak. On October 20, 1890, Robert Miller Womack (1844-1909) discovered a deposit of rich gold ore, which he called the El Paso Lode. Within three years, the population of the region increased from five hundred to over ten thousand. The increasing population, as well as political differences between area miners and mine owners, resulted in the division of El Paso County and a portion of Fremont County to create Teller County in March 1899. The population of the region declined steadily during the early twentieth century as the mines became exhausted and the cost of mining rose relative to the price of gold. Mining increased briefly in 1934 when the federal government raised the price of gold, but all gold mines ceased operation during World War II. Some mines reopened after the war, but all mines in the district were closed by 1961.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Manuscript and printed indexes and summary volumes prepared by regional abstract companies to record the history of real property titles and other financial and legal transactions in Fremont, Teller, and El Paso counties in Colorado, 1861-1972, with the bulk of the collection dating from the height of the Cripple Creek gold rush, 1890-1910. The records consist chiefly of summary accounts created by regional abstract companies from official records maintained in the Fremont, Teller, and El Paso county clerks' offices to document the acquisition and transfer of real property, mining claims, powers of attorney, and tax delinquencies. The records created by abstract companies are accompanied by small groups of business records from local institutions and individuals, as well as 22 printed maps and one disbound volume of plat maps from the region.</p>
         <p>The records for many of the abstract companies include indices, abstracts arranged by date and type, and records related to sales of real estate for delinquent taxes. Abstract companies represented in the collection include Colorado Springs Abstract Company; Cripple Creek Abstract Company; Cripple Creek District Abstract Company; Cripple Creek, Teller County, Abstract Company; El Paso and Fremont Abstract Company; El Paso County Abstract Company; El Paso County Abstract and Title Guaranty Company; Security Abstract &amp; Title Company; Smith, Barton, McDonald &amp; Co.; Teller and El Paso Abstract Company; and Teller County Abstract Company.</p>
         <p>The collection includes a single volume created by the City Treasurer of Cripple Creek Colorado from April 7, 1897 to April 19, 1899, a small group of material created by local businesses, a small amount of financial records for the United Mine Workers of America in 1933, and groups of material created by attorney Hildreth Frost and mining engineer Arthur J. Ventress.</p>
         <p>Businesses and organizations whose histories are documented include the Colorado Trading and Transfer Company; Cripple Creek State Bank; First National Bank of Cripple Creek; Golden Cycle Land Corporation; Gould Consolidated Mining Company; Lind Auto Service; Mary McKinney Mining Company; Mechanics' and Traders' Insurance Company of New Orleans; Stratton-Independence Ltd.; and Western Union Telegraph Company.</p>
