         <abstract id="aspace_16118303d72b13b38859d2dc4b54aaa5">The bulk of the collection consists of the papers of Illinois State's Attorney Julius S. Grinnell, who led the prosecution in the Haymarket trial in 1886-1887. These include trial evidence, notes and drafts of legal briefs, personal papers, and printed ephemera. The collection also includes a few items that were added to Grinnell's papers in the 1950s-60s by collector Frederick B. Adams. Trial evidence is chiefly in German, and consists of manuscripts, correspondence, leaflets, and other items seized from the offices of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Arbeiter-Zeitung
            </title>, a publication of the International Working People's Association, with which many of the defendants were involved. The manuscripts are chiefly holograph drafts of editorials by August Spies and Michael Schwab; much of the correspondence is to Spies, including several letters from Johann Most, editor of the New York paper <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Die Freiheit
            </title>. The evidence also includes other socialist and anarchist newspapers, as well as fragments of the bomb that exploded in Haymarket Square. Papers of the State's Attorney's Office include Grinnell's notes and drafts of legal briefs prepared for the trial and for the defense's appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1887. These include a draft letter from a police spy to Lucy Parsons, Albert Parsons's wife. Also present are personal papers of Grinnell: most relate directly to the trial while others document his later career. The collection also contains printed ephemera of the socialist and anarchist movements, including a number of items relating specifically to the Haymarket affair. Among these are cabinet card photographs of six of the eight convicted men.</abstract>

         <head>JULIUS S. GRINNELL</head>
         <p>Julius Sprague Grinnell was born in Massena, New York, on November 13, 1842. He was educated at Potsdam and Lawrenceville Academies, and graduated from Middlebury College in 1866. After college he taught at or was principal of the academy in Ogdensburg, New York, while he studied law with local attorneys. He was admitted to practice in New York State in 1868.</p>
         <p>According to contemporary newspaper accounts of his career, Grinnell married in 1869 and moved to Chicago in 1870, where he practiced law privately until he was elected City Attorney in 1879. He was elected State's Attorney in 1884.</p>
         <p>In 1887, in addition to the Haymarket case, Grinnell also prosecuted a high-profile case against corrupt city officials. On the strength of these two prosecutions, he was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, in June of that year, and began his term in December.</p>
         <p>For financial reasons, Judge Grinnell retired into private practice in 1891, accepting an offer to serve as counsel for the City Railway Company. He died of a heart attack on June 8, 1898, in Chicago.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series I consists of material collected as evidence for the Haymarket trial, including correspondence of the defendants; drafts, proofs, and printed versions of the IWPA publications they edited; other printed material such as broadsides advertising meetings; and other physical evidence including fragments of the Haymarket bomb.</p>
               <p>Three fragments of the bomb are present in the collection. Two were removed from the body of Mathias J. Degan, for whose murder the eight anarchists were tried, and one from a wound in the foot of another officer. These were introduced in court during testimony of doctors who treated the officers and of metallurgists who examined the composition of the fragments in comparison to other bombs known to have been made by Louis Lingg.</p>
               <p>Trial evidence is arranged by exhibit number for those items in the collection for which matches could be made to the exhibits listed in the trial transcript filed with the Illinois Supreme Court, 1886 Nov 26 (consulted by the archivist via the Chicago Historical Society Haymarket Affair Digital Collection, www.chicagohistory.org/hadc/hadctoc.htm). Other items introduced in court during testimony were not given exhibit numbers, and several of these are present in the collection. In addition to the bomb fragments, these include letters from Johann Most and Michael Malkow, confiscated with other papers from August Spies's desk at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office, and a fulminating cap that was found on Adolph Fischer at his arrest. Additional papers from the Arbeiter-Zeitung office and several socialist and anarchist newspapers collected by the prosecution seem not to have been used in the trial.</p>
               <p>Much of the evidence is in German. In most cases, English translations and/or the printed newspaper copy seem to have been officially entered into evidence. The original German-language manuscripts were brought before witnesses for the purpose of identifying handwriting, and many are annotated as trial exhibits by court employee J. M. Purcell, but they remained in the State's Attorney's possession. A few items apparently entered into the evidence examined by the jury are present, including the "Revenge! / Rache!" broadside (People's Exhibit 6).</p>
               <p>Manuscript drafts taken from the Arbeiter-Zeitung office are for the most part incomplete; for many only small fragments are present. While some pages seem to have been torn into pieces by the compositors in the normal course of their work, others were clearly cut at some point after they were seized by the state. For example, page ten of the draft identified as People's Exhibit 73 was cut after it was marked by the court. Likewise, while many of the annotations on the manuscripts appear to have been made by the staff of the newspaper, others were made by the State's Attorney's office, marking passages to be translated or quoted as evidence, or indicating the date of publication.</p>
               <p>Correspondence to August Spies and others at the Arbeiter-Zeitung office documents to some extent the editorial work of the press, as well as interaction between the Chicago IWPA and IWPA groups in other cities, particulary New York, where Die Freiheit, a sister paper, was edited by Johann Most.</p>

               <p>The bulk of the material in Series II is notes and drafts of legal briefs prepared during the trial and in preparation for the appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court. These include Grinnell's notes on the arguments delivered by both sides in court during the trial and the appeal, typed transcripts of Ingham's arguments and Judge Gary's remarks before reading the sentences, and notes of citations supporting the arguments of both sides. The notes and citations used to prepare for the appeal mainly address the defense's arguments that the court deliberately packed the jury with individuals prejudiced against the defendants, and that the accused could not be tried as accessories when the principal had not been identified.</p>
               <p>Papers documenting the investigation include drafts of a letter to Albert Parsons's wife, Lucy E. Parsons, from a police spy during the period when Parsons was in hiding, and a letter to Chicago Chief of Police Frederick Ebersold from "Amalie Shönfelder and the others" in Portland, Oregon, claiming responsibility for throwing the bomb. The Schönfelder letter is accompanied by a letter from the Portland police, who matched the handwriting to a hotel guest signing himself "John Fure." The prosecution inscribed the envelope in which the letter was stored "Schnaubelt writing," a reference to the fugitive Rudolph Schnaubelt, who was thought to be the bombthrower.</p>

               <p>Series III. Personal Papers of Julius S. Grinnell includes documents, correspondence, and other papers documenting Grinnell's career. Documents include certificates admitting Grinnell to practice in the Illinois Courts and the U. S. Supreme Court, and his appointment as Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County. Correspondence includes drafts of a letter to Illinois Governor Joseph Fifer in which Grinnell denies saying to Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison during the trial that he thought the evidence against Oscar Neebe insufficient to convict him. Also present are a letter from the editor of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Chicago Democrat
                  </title> proposing to nominate Grinnell for mayor in 1891, and a long letter from the Socialistic Labor Party refuting a lecture that Grinnell gave on protectionism and socialism in 1889.</p>
               <p>Other papers include a draft biographical statement about Judge Gary, and numerous clippings documenting Grinnell's career following the Haymarket trial and his social prominence in the 1890s. Also present are obituary notices for George Ingham. While the bulk of clippings were collected by Grinnell via a press cutting service, two clippings postdate his death.</p>

               <p>Series IV. Printed Ephemera contains broadsides, leaflets, and pamphlets of and concerning the labor and socialist movements of the day, most of them directly related to the Haymarket affair. They date from circa 1878 to 1893, and include Albert Parsons's "Appeal to the People of America;" a copy of the anarchists' speeches in court autographed by Parsons; Dyer Lum's history of the trial; a broadside calling workers to a meeting in New York the day the Haymarket trial jury delivered its verdict; and Governor Altgeld's <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Reasons for Pardoning Fielden, Neebe, and Schwab
                  </title>; as well as the constitution and bylaws of Lehr- und Wehr-Verein of Chicago and several pamphlets on socialism and anarchy.</p>
               <p>This series contains at least one item that Adams purchased separately from the Grinnell papers. This is a broadside published by the Federation of Trades Unions in September 1887, accompanied by an invoice dated nearly a decade after Adams acquired Grinnell's papers. At least two items in this series likely belonged to Grinnell: a copy of M. M. Trumbull's review of the Haymarket trial, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Trial of the Judgement
                  </title>, which bears Grinnell's autograph, and a leaflet entitled "What is Anarchy," in which a passage criticizing Grinnell is marked. The other items could conceivably have been Grinnell's, perhaps used for research during the trial or for his lectures on socialism in the years that followed.</p>

               <p>Series V. contains one item, a letter to Lucy E. Parsons from an IWPA group in St. Louis in November 1886, inviting her to speak.
