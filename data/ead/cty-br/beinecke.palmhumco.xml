This collection consists of biographical files collected by Palmquist for over nine hundred men and businesses involved in photography and photographic materials that represent the work of nearly three hundred individuals and firms. Individual photographers with significant quantities of material in the collection include Ray Jerome Baker, Augustus William Ericson, Amasa Plummer Flaglor, Alexius Alexander Holmes, N. B. Strong, and Joshua P. Vansant. Firms with substantial groups of material in the collection include the Arcata Union newspaper, Art-Ray Company, Freeman Art Co., and Seely Studio.</abstract>

         <head>Peter E. Palmquist (1936-2003)</head>
         <p>A photographer, collector, and historian of photography, Peter Eric Palmquist was born in Oakland, California on September 23, 1936. In 1944, he moved with his family to Ferndale, California, and he spent most of his life in Humboldt County. During adolescence, Palmquist trained himself in photography. He served in the United States Army as a photographer from 1955 to 1959, mainly with the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Paris, France. Palmquist worked briefly as a photographer for the state government of California from 1959-1961. From 1961 until his retirement in 1989, Palmquist worked as a staff photographer for Humboldt State University, Arcata, California, where he also graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art in 1965.</p>
         <p>From 1971 until his death, Palmquist collected textual materials and hundreds of thousands of photographic items documenting the practice and occupation of photography from its beginning through the turn of the twenty-first century. He had particular interests in early California photographers, photographers of the American West, and women photographers.</p>
         <p>A self-trained researcher and historian of photography, Palmquist organized more than a hundred exhibitions and wrote more than three hundred articles and a hundred monographs. He was a founding editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Daguerreian Annual
            </title> ; president of the National Stereoscopic Association.</p>
         <p>Palmquist died January 13, 2003, in Oakland.</p>

               <p>This series consists of photographic materials collected by Palmquist that were created by or document individual male photographers or photographic firms.</p>
               <p>This series consists of vintage photographic prints, as well as a significant quantity of copy photographs created by Palmquist of vintage photographic prints. The series documents the breadth of work by male photographers in Humboldt County from the middle of the nineteenth century to the late twentieth century. Works by a photographer may appear in multiple subseries.</p>
               <p>For most of the listed photographers, the collection has only a few photographs. However, there are significant quantities of photographs by Ray Jerome Baker, Augustus William Ericson, Amasa Plummer Flaglor, Alexius Alexander Holmes, N. B. Strong, and Joshua P. Vansant. Firms with significant quantity of material in the collection include the Arcata Union newspaper, Art-Ray Company, Freeman Art Co., and Seely Studio.</p>
               <p>Specific dates of materials or image creation dates were not captured during processing.</p>
               <p>Nearly all of the individuals and firms with photographic materials in this series have biographical files in Series I.</p>

                  <p>This subseries chiefly consists of nitrate film negatives created by or documenting individual photographers. Nitrate film negatives are cellulose treated with sulfuric acid and potassium nitrate to create cellulose mononitrate, also known as commercially as Celluloid, a highly flammable plastic used in the first half of the twentieth century for photographic film.</p>
