         <abstract id="aspace_7b1293738ca871a7da62babdecd91211">The Papers consist of correspondence, writings, personal papers, family papers, photographs, scrapbooks, and printed material that document the life and work of poet Norman Macleod. Also included are records of Pembroke Magazine, dating from 1968 to 1977, when Macleod was editor. The correspondence in the collection documents Macleod's career as a poet and editor of poetry magazines, as well as his personal and family life. Writings include autograph manuscript and typescript drafts of many of Macleod's poems, and drafts of his autobiography, Generations of Anger, that was unpublished during his lifetime. Pembroke Magazine Records include contributor files (containing submissions and correspondence with authors) and production files for each of the issues edited by Norman Macleod. The remaining material in the collection includes photographs of Macleod, family members, and associates, personal and family papers (including the autobiography of Norman Macleod's mother Alice Wicklund Mills), scrapbooks, and sound recordings of Macleod reading his poetry. The Papers are of interest not only for their documentation of Norman Macleod's life and work, but also for their documentation of twentieth-century American poetry journals, 'little magazines,' and the culture of literary journals generally.</abstract>

         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>This collection received a basic level of processing, including rehousing and organization into series, in 2013. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian. Titles have not been verified against the contents of the folders in all cases. Otherwise, folder titles are supplied by staff during initial processing.</p>
         <p>This finding aid may be updated periodically to account for new acquisitions to the collection and/or revisions in arrangement and description.</p>
