The collection documents his career through drafts of his writings and through correspondence that reveals his personal and professional relationships with fellow writers, publishers, and literary organizations. The papers also contain information about his family, documenting not only his relationships with family members but also the lives of his parents and grandparents in nineteenth-century Watertown, New York. Smith's experiences during World War I and his travels in Europe in the 1920s are documented through correspondence, autobiographical writings, photographs, and scrapbooks. His involvement with the Distributist and Agrarian movements of the 1930s is evidenced by correspondence, writings, and printed ephemera, and the collection also documents his involvement with the Society of Friends, or Quakers, particularly from the 1950s through the end of his life.</abstract>

         <head>Chard Powers Smith (1894-1977)</head>
         <p>The writer Chard Powers Smith was born in Watertown, New York, and educated at the Pawling School and Yale University, class of 1916. Following service as a captain in the U.S. Army Field Artillery during World War I, he received a law degree from Harvard in 1921, but early abandoned the practice of law to make his living as a writer. A regular at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, throughout his career, he published in a variety of genres. His best known works include <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Artillery of Time
            </title>, a historical novel; <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Where the Light Falls
            </title>, a biography/memoir of the poet Edwin Arlington Robinson; and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Housatonic: Puritan River
            </title>, part of the Rivers of America series.</p>
         <p>Smith was born into comfortable circumstances in upstate New York, his parents' marriage having joined two of Watertown's most prominent families. His father, Edward North Smith, practiced law in partnership with his father, and was later a Justice of the New York Supreme Court, Fifth District. His mother, Alice Lamon Powers, the daughter of a wealthy businessman, died in childbirth when Smith was eleven. Smith maintained a home in an old mill in nearby Sackets Harbor for many years, and based much of his writing on family and local history.</p>
         <p>Like many writers of his generation, Smith traveled and lived in Europe intermittently in the 1920s, and moved in American expatriate social and literary circles. He studied at Oxford in 1921, and in that year also married Olive Cary Macdonald; she died of complications from pregnancy in 1924 while the two were living in Italy. In addition to inspiring his own volume of poetry, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Along the Wind
            </title>, Smith's first marriage was purported to be a source for Ernest Hemingway's short story "Mr. and Mrs. Elliot;" Smith maintained a bitter grudge about the story all his life.</p>
         <p>In 1929 Smith married Marion Antoinette ("Nanette") Chester. The couple lived in Connecticut and had two children, Chard Powers Smith, Jr., and Marion Kendall Smith. Smith and his second wife divorced in 1957, and in the same year he married Eunice Waters Clark, a professor of French. After spending the last two decades of his life in Arlington, Vermont, Smith died in a nursing home in Williamstown, Massachusetts, in 1977.</p>

               <p>General Correspondence contains Chard Powers Smith's correspondence spanning 1910-1978. Carbon copies and drafts of outgoing letters are interfiled with incoming correspondence, and in some cases files contain only outgoing letters. Smith's correspondence documents his personal and professional relationships throughout his life. Of interest among his literary correspondence is a file of acrimonious letters to and from Hemingway concerning Smith's reaction to the story "Mr. and Mrs. Elliot"; this matter is further documented in correspondence with the biographer Carlos Baker, who obtained Smith's copies of the letters. Some of the larger files in the subseries include professional exchanges with editors and publishers, and personal correspondence with friends such as James Rorty, Mark Van Doren, Bernardine Szold, and Rose Gollup Cohen. Also present is a substantial file documenting Smith's involvement, along with Ralph Borsodi and others, in an effort to unite the Distributist and Agrarian movements, and his his co-editorship of the periodical <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Free America
                  </title>; this correspondence is filed together under the heading Distributist-Agrarian Movement. An extensive file concerning the Friends Seminary in New York City also documents Smith's involvement with the Albany Friends Meeting.</p>
               <p>The Family Correspondence subseries contains correspondence between Chard Powers Smith and members of his family, spanning the years 1901 to 1977. The files of letters home to his parents and grandmother are extensive and give details about his experiences at the Pawling School, at Yale, in World War I, and in Europe after the war, while other letters document his relationships with his wives, children, grandchildren, and extended family. Additional family correspondence can be found in Series IV. Family Papers.</p>
               <p>Third Party Correspondence contains letters to and from other parties, spanning the years 1919-1973. Correspondence Photocopies duplicates a small portion of the general correspondence, and may be related to Smith's work on his autobiography.</p>

               <p>Series III. Personal Papers contains address books, diaries, journals, financial and legal papers, school notebooks and other material pertaining to the personal life of Chard Powers Smith. Also present are scrapbooks documenting significant aspects of Smith's life and writing career in the 1920s; these contain reviews and other clippings, a few photographs, and correspondence including notes from John Masefield, Marianne Moore, Harriet Monroe, and other writers, as well as the attending doctor's account of Olive Smith's death. Of note among the legal papers is a 1759 deed documenting the sale of land in Dunstable, Province of New Hampshire, by Jonathan Powers to Isaac Powers.</p>

               <p>Series IV. Family Papers contains personal papers of Chard Powers Smith's family members. These include diaries and journals, other writings, financial papers, school notebooks and other personal papers of his mother, father, maternal grandmother, and his first wife. The series also includes correspondence of a broader circle of Smith's family members, with the exception of their correspondence with Smith, which is located in Series I. Material in this series chiefly documents the family's daily life in and near Watertown, New York in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, although a substantial file of letters from Edward North Smith to his father concerns his experiences at Hamilton College in the 1880s.</p>
