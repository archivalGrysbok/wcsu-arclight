         <head>Chester B. Himes (1909-1984)</head>
         <p>Chester Bomar Himes was born in Jefferson City, Missouri on July 29, 1909 to Estelle Bomar Himes and Joseph Sandy Himes. He had two brothers, Edward and Joseph. Throughout his adolescent years Himes lived in Missouri, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi and Ohio, mainly because his father, Joseph, was a teacher who worked in these locations. Himes graduated from East High School in Cleveland, Ohio in 1926 and spent the early part of his adult life in Cleveland and Columbus, where he enrolled at Ohio State University to study medicine. He was expelled from Ohio State University in 1928 and shortly afterward was arrested, convicted for armed robbery, and sentenced, at the age of nineteen, to a twenty-five year term in prison. Himes served only part of that sentence, from 1928 to1936, at the Ohio State Penetentiary in Columbus, during which time he became a published and somewhat well-known writer. Evidently inspired to begin writing by a 1930 prison fire in which 300 inmates were killed, while in prison he published a number of articles and short stories in newspapers and magazines, most notably in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Esquire
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Released from prison in 1936, he married Jean Lucinda Johnson in 1937. From 1938 to 1941 he worked for the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cleveland Daily News
            </title> and the Ohio Writers' Project, for which he wrote a history of Cleveland for the WPA Guide Series. Himes moved to California in 1941 and continued writing and working at shipyards until 1944, all the while trying with little success to secure a publisher for his novel <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Black Sheep
            </title> (later published, in 1952, as <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Cast the First Stone
            </title>). With the help of a Rosenwald Fellowship he was able to complete his first book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               If He Hollers Let Him Go
            </title>, which was published in 1945. His second book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Lonely Crusade
            </title>, was published in 1947. Himes moved to Paris around 1953, and in 1955 published <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Primitive
            </title>. The first book of his now famous hard-boiled detective fiction series, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               For Love of Imabelle
            </title>, which features two African American detectives from Harlem, Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, was released in 1957. Himes spent the rest of his days living and writing in Europe, including stints in France, Germany and England, but primarily in Moraira on the southern coast of Spain with his second wife, Lesley Packard Himes. He published many other works including his two volume autobiography, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Quality of Hurt
            </title>(1973) and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               My Life of Absurdity
            </title> (1976). He died in Moraira, Spain on November 12, 1984.</p>

               <p>The series contains a small amount of Himes's incoming and outgoing correspondence. The bulk of the correspondence documents Himes's professional relationships with G.P. Putnam's Sons editor William Targ and photographer and writer Carl Van Vechten. The letters between Targ and Himes date from when Targ served as editor and editor in chief at two different publishing companies, The World Publishing Company, where he was from 1942 until 1964, and G. P. Putnam's Sons, where he worked from 1964 until 1978. The series also includes one letter from Himes to Helen Meyer, editor at Dell Publishing Co. Inc and four letters from Himes to Roslyn Targ, wife of William Targ and owner of Roslyn Targ Literary Agency Inc.</p>
               <p>A large amount of the correspondence discusses contracts and payments for some of Himes's manuscripts and movie contracts. Some of the letters contain considerable discussion about discrepancies in payments and contracts for Himes's book, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Cotton Comes To Harlem
                  </title>, which was turned into a movie. Other letters discuss Himes's life traveling in Europe and his life in Spain. The letters also discuss Himes's disapproval of the way publishers edited some of his books. In a letter to Helen Meyer, Himes protests the cover and descriptive copy of his book <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Run Man Run
                  </title>.  Carl Van Vechten's letters discuss Himes's writings, his gifts to Yale, his travels, and their mutual friends and interests.</p>

               <p>The photographs in this series document Himes's life with his family and friends. The series includes portraits of Himes, reproductions of snapshots of Himes as a child and as a teenager and also some photographs of his mother, Estelle Bomar Himes, and his brother Joseph S. Himes, Jr.. Also included in this series are photographs of Himes with Regine Fischer, and a number of images of Himes in the studio and home of his friend Walter Coleman, the American painter. Coleman's wife was the silversmith Torun Bülow-Hübe, and there are several photographs of her and her work. Also included are two photographs of Himes speaking on a panel that includes Rebecca West at an event in France celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of Feux Croisés, and two photographs of Himes with French author Jean Giono.</p>
               <p>Dates pencilled on the photographs were added by the library at the time of acquisition, and refer to letters from Himes to Carl Van Vechten, which can be found in the Carl Van Vechten Papers. These letters provide context for the photographs.</p>
