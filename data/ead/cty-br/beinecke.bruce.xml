         <head>JOHN BRUCE, 1802-1869</head>
         <p>John Bruce was born in London and educated in England and Aberdeen. While he was trained in English law, he did not practice after 1840, and instead pursued his historical and antiquarian interests.</p>
         <p>In particular, Bruce devoted much of his energy and attention to the newly important scholarly societies and publication projects of his day. Bruce held two offices in the Society of Antiquaries and wrote many articles for its journal, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Archaelogia
            </title>, including his "Inedited Documents Relating to the Condemnation and Imprisonment of Sir Thomas More" (xxvii, 10) and the "Inquiry into the Authenticity of the Paston Letters" (v. xli, 15). For the Parker Society he edited <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Works of Roger Hutchinson
            </title> (1842), and was co-editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Correspondence of Matthew Parker
            </title> (1853) with T. T. Perowne.</p>
         <p>Bruce was a principal founder and officer of the Camden Society, and contributed many of its early publications, including its first, <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Historie of the Arrivall of Edward IV....
            </title> (1839). For the Society, Bruce edited selections of correspondence and documents relating to Elizabeth I, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leceister, Robert Cecil, Lord Burleigh, James I, and Charles I. In addition, Bruce edited the first publications of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Letters and Papers of the Verney Family...
            </title> (1853); the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Liber Famelicus
            </title> of Sir James Whitlocke (1858); and the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Journal of a Voyage into the Mediterranean
            </title> of Sir Kenelm Digby (1868). Bruce also offered advice and assistance to many historians and biographers of the period, including Caroline Amelia Halsted, the first biographer of Richard III to draw upon unpublished sources such as MS Harleian 433.</p>
         <p>The project that occupied the final decades of his scholarly career was the 12 volumes of the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Charles I....
            </title> (1858-71). In 1861 he was appointed a Trustee of the Sir John Sloan's Museum. John Bruce died suddenly in London on October 28, 1869, his wife having predeceased him.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This finding aid encompasses accessions of single manuscripts and small groups of manuscripts and other papers, by or pertaining to John Bruce, acquired by the library from a variety of sources. Materials incorporated into the collection prior to May 2002 have been organized into two series.</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref11">Series I, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                  Letters to John Bruce
               </title> 
            </ref>, has been arranged alphabetically by correspondent and contains business and professional letters addressed to Bruce, frequently in his role as an officer of the Camden Society. Topics include meetings, membership nominations, dues collection, and publication plans of the societies. Many of the letters date from the first years of the Camden Society's existence and offer support for the new venture. Lord Mahon, on the other hand, pointed out that "the Roxburgh, Bannatyne, Abbotsford and other societies already existing seem to be quite adequate to the purpose required," and declined to join the Camden (Box 1, folder 74).</p>
         <p>Several correspondents address Bruce's personal scholarly pursuits. Letters by John Hymers and Cornelius Nickerson discuss the editing of Roger Hutchinson's works. The letters of Macvey Napier reveal his editorial policy for historical articles in the <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Edinburgh Review
            </title> and explain his lack of interest in a Bruce submission: "nor have I ever heard of Sarah Martin, either by herself, or in connection with 'prison discipline.'...Look about you for an article <title type="simple" render="italic">
               similar
            </title> to the last." Julia Pardoe's letters thank Bruce for his encouragement and request further advice. A. F. Holt of Eton College explains his failure to locate a volume in the college library: "the catalogue...is imperfect as it is, and the present position of the books does not, in any degree, correspond with it."</p>
         <p>Finally, other letters offer more general insights into mid-nineteenth century scholarship. Letters from the widow and son of James Bird, including two to the popular royal biographer Agnes Strickland, concern the relief provided by the Literary Fund Society and George Bird's hope for Strickland's assistance in continuing to edit "Pawsey's Ladies' Pocket Book." The Rev. Robert Dixon's letters detail his attempts to rebuild the only college (and the only library) on the Isle of Man. Robert Eden, John Mee Mathews, and J. A. Cramer discuss their own research projects.</p>
         <p>
            <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:show="replace" target="ref229">Series II, <title type="simple" render="italic">
                  Letters of Caroline Amelia Halsted
               </title> 
            </ref>, contains chronologically arranged letters to Bruce, primarily on the writing of her <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Richard III as Duke of Gloucester and King of England
            </title> (1844). Halsted requests extracts from the then-unpublished Croyland Chronicles; discusses her use of manuscript sources and society publications; sends Bruce completed chapters for "the pruning knife;" and asks advice on the selection of frontispieces, negotiatiing with her publisher, Longmans, and the appropriate use of gift copies.</p>
         <p>Halsted's letters also reveal her strong sense of her position as a woman historian. As early as December 8, 1842, she expressed misgivings about writing "a book that...is <title type="simple" render="italic">
               almost
            </title> too strong for a woman's pen." In a letter of February 28, 1844, she states: "I sometimes think I have too many notes--and too much Appendix--and yet I thought I ought to give my authorities, considering the suspicious way in which a <title type="simple" render="italic">
               woman's
            </title> opinion wd. be viewed, unless well backed, on a subject so <title type="simple" render="italic">
               important
            </title>." Halsted also reminds Bruce that research for an essay on "'the progress of opinions' concerning Richard... could <title type="simple" render="italic">
               not
            </title> be accomplished, except at the British Museum."</p>
         <p>Her later letters contain requests for copies of reviews, comments on sales of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Richard III
            </title>, and discussions of her search for a new subject. While Halsted accepted Bruce's discouragement about Alfred the Great, and considered writing a biography of a woman, she rejected the idea that she should write fiction. "I have no imagination for fairy tales and I am too matter of fact for <title type="simple" render="italic">
               novels
            </title>--but I love historical research; heart and soul goes to work on it." (Box 1, folder 81)</p>
         <p>The Halsted letters also contain news of her travels and her home life, as well as repeated inquiries about the health of Mrs. Bruce and plans for visits to London.</p>
