         <abstract id="aspace_17d196c776bd4a869aeaf6ea9092041a">Portraits of individuals from other communities and locales include street portraits of pedestrians in New York City; residents of a drug rehabilitation program at facilities throughout New York State; the people of Heber Springs, Arkansas, the rural town photographed decades earlier by Mike Disfarmer; and African American members of the First Baptist Church of Riverhead, New York. Tucker's commission work includes portraits of individuals, couples, and families. Her personal photography projects include portraits of family members, friends, and bodybuilders, as well as seascape and landscape photography.<lb/>The subjects for Tucker's portraiture have come principally from Native American populations. These include members of the Onondaga Nation, Shinnecock Indian Nation, Navajo Nation, and Montaukett Indians. Tucker has also documented Native American artists from pueblos throughout the southwestern United States.<lb/>This collection documents the career of Toba Pato Tucker as a portrait photographer, circa 1950-2011, and landscape photography since 2010, with the bulk of the collection from 1977 to 2015. The photographic materials in this collection consist of exhibition prints, work prints, and negatives for nine major projects, as well as her commission work and personal photography. The papers largely support her photographic work and consist of her project files, which include background research, correspondence, and oral history interviews. The papers also include exhibition catalogs, publications, and publicity material produced for projects, as well as a small amount of personal papers.</abstract>

         <head>Toba Pato Tucker (born 1935)</head>
         <p>Toba Pato Tucker refers to herself as "a contemporary American documentary portrait photographer" who "strives to record continuity and change in American culture for history and artistic purposes with a particular interest in Native American populations."</p>
         <p>Born and raised in the Bronx, New York, Toba Pato married Robert Paul Tucker (Yale 1944) in 1956. They, and their daughter, Dena Suzanne Tucker, lived in West Hartford, Connecticut. After the marriage ended, Toba Pato Tucker returned to New York City.</p>
         <p>Initially a self-taught amateur photographer, Tucker began her professional career after attending a workshop taught by Harold Feinstein in 1976. In her early work, she used a Pentax camera that exposed thirty-five millimeter film. In 1976, she bought a used Hasselblad camera that exposed 120 millimeter film. The following year her friend and mentor Toby Old helped her master the intricacies of the Hasselblad as well as how to develop black and white film and print fine art silver gelatin photographs. Although Tucker occasionally used other cameras, the Hasselblad was her primary camera for the remainder of her career. Primarily a black and white photographer, Tucker occasionally used color negative film. From 1978 to 1980, she taught at the International Center of Photography in New York City.</p>
         <p>Over her career, the subjects for her portraiture have chiefly come from Native American populations. These include members of the Onondaga Nation, Shinnecock Indian Nation, Navajo Nation, and Montaukett Indians. Tucker has also documented Native American artists from pueblos throughout the southwestern United States.</p>
         <p>Tucker also created portraits of individuals from other communities and locales, including street portraits of pedestrians in New York City and Minneapolis, Minnesota; residents of Day Top Village, a drug rehabilitation program with facilities throughout New York State; the people of Heber Springs, Arkansas -- the rural town photographed decades earlier by Mike Disfarmer (1884-1959); and African American members of the First Baptist Church of Riverhead, New York. During her work with residents of Day Top Village and Heber Springs, Tucker taped oral history interviews with her portrait subjects.</p>
         <p>In 2012, Tucker began concentrating on landscape photography, epitomized by a project to document the American West using the work of nineteenth century photographers as reference points.</p>
         <p>In her commission work, Tucker created portraits of individuals, couples, and families. Other projects included portraits of family members, friends, and bodybuilders, as well as seascape and landscape photography.</p>

         <p>Many photographs of Native Americans in the collection document these individuals and their communities during the late twentieth century. Most of the portraits depict Native Americans wearing modern clothes, which underscore their contemporary lives. Portraits of individuals wearing traditional costumes also appear throughout the collection, reflect Tucker's interest in tracing cultural continuity as well as change within Native American communities.</p>
         <p>The photographs and papers for the Daytop Village Portraits project provide unique documentation of drug rehabilitation centers during the 1970s. The audio interviews frequently report the circumstances of individuals that led them to drug use and of their eventual entry into the rehabilitation center, while other audio recordings provide glimpses into the program from the residents' vantage point.</p>

               <p>Series I mainly consists of photographic materials created by Tucker during her projects, as well as her commissioned portraits and personal portraits. The photographic material documents the evolution of images from negatives captured during portrait sessions through their development into exhibition prints. The negatives show variant images captured by Tucker of subjects, while the related work prints, contact sheets, and negatives frequently include her notes for printing exhibition prints. The exhibition prints relay her final vision for the each image. Most of the photographic prints are black and white, usually with a square frame, although she included color photographic materials in a few projects, including the Navajo Portraits and the Onondaga Nation Portraits. Tucker rarely crops her images and her prints usually show the entire image captured in her negatives.</p>

                  <p>This subseries consists of contact sheets and negatives that often include Tucker's notes for printing exhibition prints.</p>
                  <p>On initial receipt of the collection, Tucker kept the negatives used in creating exhibition photographic prints and they are not present in the collection. The negatives will be sent to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library upon her death.</p>
                  <p>All the negatives and contact sheets are housed in ring binder portfolio boxes, except where noted and housed in boxes. All quantities of negatives are approximate. Unless otherwise noted, negatives are black and white.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series II includes textual and audiovisual materials compiled by Tucker for each of her photographic projects. The largest documentation is available for the Daytop Village Portraits and Heber Springs Portraits. The files document the course of each project and include background research on the community and correspondence with portrait subjects, scholars, or funding institutions. Audiotapes in several of the project files contain interviews conducted by Tucker with portrait subjects and subject experts, including anthropologists, historians, and sociologists. The interviews often include biographical information about the portrait subjects or information about their community. A few audiotapes document telephone conversations of Tucker. Portrait lists and release forms identify portrait subjects. These project files also contain information about the products of a project, including exhibition catalogs (including publicity materials explicitly produced for the exhibitions), publications, and other publicity material.</p>

               <p>Series V includes landscape photography by Tucker, 2012-2015, from her ongoing project, <title>
                     Re Viewing the American Landscape, West &amp; Southwest
                  </title>, that references the work of nineteenth century photographers in her visual documentation of the American West</p>
               <p>Inkjet prints have printed titles on rectos. In her titles, Tucker uses a swung dash mark to separate phrases in her titles. Due to limitations of typescript expression in computer systems, this guide substitutes dashes for the swung dashes. Additionally, the printed titles are prefixed with locations, which this guide transmits as subseries. Subseries titles are also informed by interleaving sheets between groups of prints when accessioned by the Library. The interleaving sheets are retained in the collection.</p>
               <p>Occassionally this guide expands abbreviations in print titles. All captialization in the titles are by Tucker.</p>
               <p>Each inkjet print of an image created by Tucker is signed a dated by her on versos.</p>
