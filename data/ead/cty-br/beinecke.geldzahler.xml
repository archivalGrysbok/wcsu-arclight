         <p>Collections are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, and competing priorities. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>

Various acquisitions associated with the collection have not been merged and organized as a whole. Each acquisition is described separately in the contents list below, titled according to month and year of acquisition.</p>
         <p>Information included in the Description of Papers note and Collection Contents section is drawn from information supplied with the collection and from an initial survey of the contents. Folder titles appearing in the contents list below are often based on those provided by the creator or previous custodian.

         <head>Henry Geldzahler (1935-1994)</head>
         <p>Henry Geldzahler was born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1935, and emigrated with his family to the United States in 1940. He graduated from Yale University in 1957 and joined the staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1960, becoming the first curator of contemporary art. In 1966, Geldzahler served as United States Commissioner of Art at the Venice Biennale, as well as the first director of the Visual Arts program for the National Endowment for the Arts. From 1977 to 1982, he held the position of Cultural Affairs Commissioner for the City of New York. After leaving that job, he worked as a private curator. Geldzahler died of cancer in 1994.</p>
