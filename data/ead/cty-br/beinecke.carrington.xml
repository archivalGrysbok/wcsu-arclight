         <abstract id="aspace_df7b9c2b5848cca65b48355ed7683cc4">The J. B. Carrington Papers hold correspondence, literary manuscripts, photographs, and research files related to his career as an editor and writer at Scribner's Magazine. Correspondents include authors and artists who contributed work to the magazine, such as Frederick S. Church, James B. Connolly, Kenyon Cox, Andrew Lang, Maxfield Parrish, Frederick Waugh, and N. C. Wyeth, who are represented by letters and literary manuscripts. In addition, Carrington kept financial records on the company's literary assets, detailing amounts paid to authors and tabulating the literary costs of each issue published between 1892 and 1906. Other correspondents in the papers relate to Carrington's research on contemporary wood engravers, including William B. Closson, Elbridge Kingsley, Gustav Kruell, Caroline Amelia Powell, and S. G. Putnam, among others. Also present are twenty-five art photographs taken by Carrington, who wrote on photography for Scribner's, and pieces of ephemera that document his activities at the Salmagundi Club.</abstract>

         <p>Collection are processed to a variety of levels, depending on the work necessary to make them usable, their perceived research value, the availability of staff, competing priorities, and whether or not further accruals are expected. The library attempts to provide a basic level of preservation and access for all collections, and does more extensive processing of higher priority collections as time and resources permit.</p>
         <p>Materials comprising the J. B. Carrington Papers were received by the Yale University Library in 1946 from Walter Henry Cook (1896-1978), a graduate of Yale University (1919), and a resident on Nod Hill Road in Ridgefield, Connecticut. After they arrived at the library, the Carrington Family Papers were divided at some point, with papers related to Henry Beebee Carrington remaining in Sterling Memorial Library (Manuscripts and Archives Department) and parts of the papers distributed to other divisions of the library.</p>
         <p>James B. Carrington's correspondence and papers related to his career at <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scribner's Magazine
            </title> were placed in the Yale Collection of American Literature and were moved into the Beinecke Library in 1963. This material had been classified as Za Carrington and is now in Series I, II, and IV. Within those papers, the records describing the Scribner company's literary assets had been sealed by the library from their arrival in 1946 through 1996.</p>
         <p>Most of Carrington's letters from wood engravers remained in the Manuscript and Archives Department until they were transferred to the Beinecke Library in March 1978, and added to Za Carrington; this material is now in Series III.</p>
         <p>The rest of Carrington's correspondence and research papers related to wood engraving were placed with Yale University Library's Arts of the Book Collection when that department was formed in 1967, and the papers kept there with the department's Prints and Plates Collection. That print collection was transferred to the Beinecke Library in 1999 and renamed the General Print Collection. The Carrington material was removed from the General Print Collection and reunited with the J. B. Carrington papers in 2012, where it is also now in Series III.</p>
         <p>The set of twenty-five art photographs taken by Carrington were transferred from Manuscripts and Archives to the Beinecke Library in 1979 and placed under the call number Za Objects Art; they were reunited with the J. B. Carrington papers in 2012 and are now in Series V.</p>

         <head>J. B. Carrington (1860-1929)</head>
         <p>James Beebee Carrington was born in Columbus, Ohio, the son of United States Army General and historian Henry Beebee Carrington (Yale 1845) and his first wife Margaret Irvin Sullivant. Wabash College records show that Carrington attended that college for two years while his father was an instructor there. In 1876-1877 he was a preparatory student enrolled in the "English Course," which had no Greek or Latin, and was intended more as a business track. The next academic year, 1877-1878, he was enrolled in the first year of the "Scientific Preparatory" program, which differed from the "Classical Preparatory" program in that it offered Latin, but no Greek instruction. While he did not complete a degree, Wabash College awarded him an honorary Master of Arts in 1897.</p>
         <p>Carrington joined the staff of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Scribner's Magazine
            </title> when it was founded in 1887 and remained associated with the journal through his death, both as an editor and an author of feature articles, poems, and photographic essays. An active member of the Salmagundi Club in New York, he wrote for other periodicals and lectured publicly on the topics of art and illustration. Carrington had a particular interest in the technique of wood engraving and its practitioners, and contributed the biographical notes and bibliography to Philip Hamerton's two-volume work <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Art of the American Wood-engraver
            </title> (Scribner's, 1894).</p>
         <p>J. B. Carrington died at his home on Nod Hill Road in Ridgefield, Connecticut, on July 14, 1929; he was survived by his wife Eva Doolittle Carrington, who died on August 6, 1942.</p>

Wyeth's autobiographical statement. One folder holds responses to a seven-question survey on the education and advancement of American artists that Carrington sent out to academics and artists.</p>

                  </title> at the turn of the century, and a group of literary manuscripts that were submitted for publication.

The literary manuscripts vary from full essays to just fragments of works, presumably kept for their autograph value.</p>

               <p>Series III holds Carrington's correspondence with contemporary wood engravers, galleys, proofs, and tear sheets of his writings on the topic, and other related research files. Much of the material was gathered for his contribution to the two-volume limited-edition work <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     The Art of the American Wood-engraver
                  </title> (New York: Scribner's Sons, 1894). Volume one contains an essay by Philip Gilbert Hamerton, followed by catalogue entries and biographical notes by Carrington to describe the forty wood engravings and twenty-three artists featured in volume two: Walter Aikman, George T. Andrew, C. Irving Butler, C. W. Chadwick, William B. Clossen, John P. Davis, Edward H. Del'Orme, George H. Del'Orme, Francis E. Fillebrown, Frank French, Thomas H. Heard, Thomas Johnson, Frederick Juengling, Frank S. King, Elbridge Kingsley, Frederick A. Pettit, S. G. Putnam, George A. Teel, R. G. Tietze, I. M. Van Ness, Robert Varley, William B. Witte, and Henry Wolf. Also in volume one is Carrington's bibliography on American wood engraving.</p>
               <p>In addition to that project, Carrington wrote a series of biographies of wood engravers for <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Scribner's Magazine
                  </title>, and the files hold proofs and galleys for those articles, as well as general research material on wood engraving.</p>

               <p>Series V primarily holds miscellaneous personal papers related to Carrington's life. They include photographs of colleagues, a small card for his bicycle trip with the Touring Club de France which has a photograph of Carrington on the verso, a brochure advertising his availability to lecture on the topic of "American Illustration of Today," and three ephemeral items from his club, Salmagundi, in New York. Among other items is an India proof of Timothy Cole's bookplate for Flora Gardiner Kling, signed by Cole and Kling.</p>

               <p>The series holds twenty-five pictorialist photographs taken by Carrington at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the images measure approximately 8 by 10 inches and were mounted on 11 by 13-inch sheets of heavy paper; most are not titled or captioned. Subjects include New York City street scenes including views made after a snowfall, images of sailing ships at the city's river piers, and one view in Central Park. Carrington took photographs while visiting Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, a place frequented by some of the illustrators he worked with at <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Scribner's Magazine
                  </title>; a folder of images of fishermen at work may have been taken on the island. Other subjects are cattle, a waterfall, and a portrait of Alexander Theobold van Laer and Charles M. Fairbanks sitting together in the Salmagundi clubhouse at 14 West 12th Street, New York.</p>
