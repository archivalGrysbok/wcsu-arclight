<head>Biography</head>
<p>The following biographical information is taken from: Steiner, W. R. (1904). The Reverend Gershom Bulkeley of Connecticut, an Eminent Clerical Physician. *Medical library and historical journal*, 2(2), 91.</p>   
<p>Gershom Bulkeley was an eminent Clerical Physician. He preached in a church in Wethersfield, Connecticut between 1666-1667 when he resigned by reason of weakness of his voice. After his retirement, he moved to Glastonbury and maintained a large medical practice. His patients came from a wide territory and included some of the best families of the state. With all these patients, many of whom he treated before 1686, it seems strange that he was not licensed to practice medicine until October 14 of that year. His library is now much scattered and destroyed. Besides the group of about 34 [sic] volumes owned by the Hartford Medical Society, some are in the possession of Trinity College. His manuscripts show that he was in the habit of making abstracts of important articles and books that he did not own. He was also constantly recording prescriptions and remedies said to be effectual by members of his profession or the laity. His knowledge of chemistry was most profound, and his laboratory was well stocked with apparatus and chemicals. He was a master of several languages, among which were Greek, Latin and Dutch. Besides theology and medicine, he was skilled in the knowledge of law and was a politician in the noblest sense of the word. His pamphlets, "The People's Right to Election", and "Will and Doom" shoed his Tory tendencies.</p>
