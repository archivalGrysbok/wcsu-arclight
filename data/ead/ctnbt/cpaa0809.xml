Czeslaw Gieniewski's papers include a family history going back to the January Uprising of 1863, through participation in the Pilsudski legions and regaining of Poland’s independence on November 11, 1918, and the Bolshevik War 1919-1921.  Mr. Gieniewski describes him and his family's deportation to Russia and enlistment to the Polish Army, which was formed in the USSR, after a political pact made between the Polish government and Jozef Stalin was signed in June of 1941.  General Wladyslaw Anders was in command of the Polish Army on Russian territory.   Mr. Gieniewski participated in the battles in Italy in 1944 and 1945, including the famous battle of Monte Cassino.  He immigrated to the US and participated in veterans’ affairs and was active in Polish American community in New Jersey, where he still lives with his family. </abstract>
