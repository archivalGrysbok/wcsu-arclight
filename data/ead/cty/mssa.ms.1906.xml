         <abstract id="aspace_6395eb418b783d2d83af2a10b3020291">The collection comprises a photograph album of approximately seventy pages, and approximately fifty pages of correspondence documenting the life and work of Ida Pyland, a Presbyterian missionary living in Sancti Spiritus, Cuba, during the first two decades of the twentieth century. Personal correspondence contains observations concerning daily life in Cuba, including social and racial relations among Cubans. Pyland provides observations on the school, her favorite students, transportation between the United States and Cuba, and her feelings about living as an expatriate in Cuba. School correspondence provides details about the Presbyterian missionary effort in Cuba, including information about locations and personalities in the schools, and also about the program of study at the schools. The photographs document trips into the countryside, farming, Cuban families, school children, and scenes of streets and harbors in cities and villages in Cuba.</abstract>
