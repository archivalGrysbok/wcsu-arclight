         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Benjamin Pogrund was born in Cape Town, South Africa on May 5, 1933. He obtained degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Bachelor of Social Science at the University of Cape Town between 1950 and 1956 and of Bachelor of Arts in African Studies at Witwatersrand University in 1971.From 1958 to 1985, Pogrund worked in a variety of capacities for the<emph render="italic">Rand Daily Mail</emph>, including African affairs reporter, night editor, and deputy editor. He achieved acclaim and notoriety for his reports on prison conditions and for his coverage of black South African individuals and groups who organized resistance to apartheid. Pogrund also wrote on South African affairs for many publications abroad, including the<emph render="italic">Boston Globe</emph>,<emph render="italic">Economist</emph>,<emph render="italic">Today</emph>,<emph render="italic">New Republic</emph>, and<emph render="italic">Sunday Times</emph>(London) and published several books, including a biography of Robert Sobukwe. Pogrund collected extensive materials documenting the struggle against apartheid and donated them to research libraries around the world. He moved to London in the mid-1980s, where he worked in the foreign departments of several newspapers and commented widely on South Africa. He lived for a short while in the United States during the 1990s before moving to Israel to establish the Center for Social Concern in 1997.</p>
         <p>An author, journalist, and editor, Pogrund worked for the <title render="italic">
               Rand Daily Mail
            </title> in Johannesburg from 1958 to 1985, when the newspaper was shut down due to financial trouble and government pressure. Under the leadership of Laurence Gandar, Raymond Louw, and Pogrund, the <title render="italic">
               Rand Daily Mail
            </title> became internationally renowned for its coverage of the unjust system of apartheid. Pogrund served in a variety of capacities including African affairs reporter, night editor and deputy editor. While a beat writer on African affairs, Pogrund wrote groundbreaking articles investigating the conditions in which black South Africans lived under apartheid, reporting on the unjust imprisonment of black activists, and giving attention to black politics. He covered the activities of black groups such as the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress and activists such as Nelson Mandela and Robert Sobukwe.</p>
         <p>Pogrund was imprisoned and prosecuted twice for his reporting. He was arrested in 1961 and spent eight days in jail for refusing to divulge a source that had given him inside information on government protests conducted on Republic Day of that year. In 1965, Pogrund wrote a series of articles exposing the miserable conditions in South African prisons. The government responded by prosecuting Pogrund, his informants, Laurence Gandar, and the newspaper. The trial became known as the "Prisons Case" and became a showcase for censorship of the press by the South African government. Initially found guilty, the verdict against Pogrund was overturned on appeal in 1972.</p>
         <p>Pogrund also wrote on South African affairs for a number of sources outside of South Africa, including the <title render="italic">
               Boston Globe
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               Economist
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               Today
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               New Republic
            </title>, and <title render="italic">
               Sunday Times
            </title> (London). Pogrund published several books, including <title render="italic">
               How Can Man Die Better: The Life of Robert Sobukwe
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Through contacts made while investigating and writing about black affairs, Pogrund also acquired a large amount of historical materials documenting the struggle by Africans to end apartheid. Funded first by the Hoover Institution and then the Center for Research Libraries, Pogrund collected and contributed greatly to the microfilm and archival holdings on South African affairs in many U.S. libraries.</p>
         <p>After the <title render="italic">
               Rand Daily Mail
            </title> ceased publication, Pogrund moved to England where he worked in the foreign departments of several newspapers, including the <title render="italic">
               Independent
            </title>. He spent some time living in the United States in the 1990s before moving to Israel in 1997 to start up the Center for Social Concern, an organization established to facilitate the peace process in the Middle East.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, Correspondence documents Pogrund's relationships with political activists, journalists, friends, family, and other associates. Letters between Pogrund and noted activist and dissident Robert Sobukwe comprise a particularly important part of the collection. Written predominantly while Sobukwe was imprisoned on Robben Island for organizing a mass protest in 1960, the letters concern a variety of topics, including international affairs, social and political philosophy, religion, and the day to day lives of each man. The Sobukwe correspondence also contains letters between Pogrund and other supporters of Sobukwe, such as Eulalie Stott and Peter Hjul, documenting the extensive efforts to provide Sobukwe with legal representation, food, clothing, books, and other items. Photostats of letters from Sobukwe to his wife Veronica, letters from other members of Sobukwe's family to Pogrund, and one folder of speeches are also listed under Robert Sobukwe.</p>
               <p>Correspondence between Pogrund and <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> colleagues Laurence O. V. Gandar, Raymond Louw, and Harold Strachan comprises another portion of the series. The letters document the affairs of the newspaper, particularly the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> "Prisons Case." Additional material on the "Prisons Case" and the Rand Daily News generally can be found in Series II and III respectively.</p>
               <p>The series also includes a small amount of personal correspondence. Two folders of letters from Norma Kitson to Pogrund and one folder of correspondence with Astrid Pogrund document his romantic relationships.</p>
               <p>Four folders of general correspondence, arranged chronologically, are listed at the beginning of the series.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Prisons Files consist of a wide variety of materials Pogrund created and collected while writing about and working to transform the penal system in South Africa. The files are arranged alphabetically by topic and most of the series falls under three headings: Legal proceedings, <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> "Prisons Case," and Statements by prisoners.</p>
               <p>Legal proceedings document court cases between prisoners and specific prisons or the South African government. The files predominantly contain transcripts of proceedings, but they also include some correspondence, clippings, notes, and other materials relating to specific cases.</p>
               <p>In 1965, the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> ran a series of exposés on the conditions for prisoners incarcerated in the Republic of South Africa. The government charged that the reports were false and took the newspaper to court. Pogrund, Laurence Gandar, Raymond Louw, and Harold Strachan were named specifically in the charges and the subsequent court case became a major news story and an obvious source of tension between the media and the South African government. The files that pertain to the case include the Pogrund articles on prison conditions, clippings, correspondence, court transcripts, legal documents, and other miscellaneous materials. Pogrund also kept several scrapbooks of clippings that cover the events surrounding the case that are listed with the Oversize materials. Other files on the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> can be found in Series III and more of Pogrund's writings on the trials and prison conditions in general can be found in the newspaper articles section of Series IV.</p>
               <p>Statements by prisoners consist of interviews Pogrund and others conducted and compiled in support of their research on prison conditions. The stories told in the statements document the miserable conditions many prisoners in South African jails endured while being detained. Andrew Sacks, Isaac Setsheti, Harold Strachan, Filisberto Taimo, and Johannes Adries Theron are some of the individuals whose prison experiences are covered in these files.</p>
               <p>Files under "Republic Day Protest" pertain to Pogrund's imprisonment for failing to disclose his sources for a story he ran about demonstrations carried out on Republic Day in 1961. The series also includes a select number of topical files on electric shock treatment, the farm labor system, the Police Act of 1979, the Republic of South Africa's Department of Prisons, typhoid, and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Subject Files document a wide variety of individuals, organizations, countries, and topics relating to Pogrund's multi-faceted professional and political interests. The files are arranged alphabetically and most are comprised of materials Pogrund collected in the course of his activities.</p>
               <p>The series includes many files documenting specific political groups that opposed the apartheid system in South Africa, such as the Congress Alliance, the Pan Africanist Congress, the Congress of Democrats, the South African Council on Trade Unions, the South African Coloured People's Congress, the African National Congress, the Black Sash, the Liberal Party of South Africa, the Ninety Day Protest Committee, the South African Communist Party, and the Union Council of Coloured Affairs. Collected publications, pamphlets, and other items comprise a substantial amount of materials documenting the efforts of the South African Institute of Race Relations. The series also holds a substantial amount of material regarding the South African Coloured National Convention of 1961. Folders relating to Search for Alternatives contain information on Pogrund's efforts with John Rees to find a functional alternative to the rule of apartheid.</p>
               <p>Along with several files listed under South African Press, the series includes folders on the media in South Africa and the rest of the world. Most significant among these are materials covering "Challenging the Censors: World News Media Action Conference," the Newspaper Press Union of South Africa, the South African Press Council, the South African Society of Journalists, and the World Press Freedom Committee. Files relating to the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> document the operation of the newspaper and its closing in 1985. Researchers should consult Series II for materials about the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> "Prisons Case." Programs created by Pogrund and others to train Africans to become reporters are listed under "Black journalist training."</p>
               <p>Subject Files also contains several folders pertaining to formal government "Commissions of Inquiry" into Alleged Irregularities in the Former Department of Information; the Mass Media; and the Riots in Soweto.</p>
               <p>Pogrund's efforts to collect historical information to be placed into libraries and other cultural institutions are filed under Center for Research Libraries, Public libraries, and Research libraries. Correspondence with the Hoover Institute in Series I also documents these efforts.</p>
               <p>Collections of materials Pogrund compiled about specific individuals (Stephen Biko, Ruth Hayman, John Horak, Clements Kodali, Nelson Mandela, Andrew Silk, Rosemary Wentzel) and countries (Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia) round out the remainder of the series.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is organized alphabetically within four sections: books, magazine articles, newspaper articles, and speeches. The writings cover almost four decades of Pogrund's work, but should not be considered comprehensive.</p>
               <p>The books section includes documentation on two monographs. The files for the unpublished "Communist Activity in South Africa from 1945" contain extensive notes Pogrund prepared for a major study on the South African Communist Party that political and personal circumstances prevented him from actually writing. Organized by chapter, the files include notes from interviews and other sources. Researchers should consult the first folder "Hypotheses and outline" to obtain detailed information on Pogrund's plan for the layout and arguments of the book. The files for <title render="italic">
                     How Can Man Die Better
                  </title> include correspondence and research materials used by Pogrund in writing the book. A small amount of correspondence with Veronica Sobukwe can be found in these files, but the bulk of Pogrund's and Robert Sobukwe's correspondence with her can be found in Series I.</p>
               <p>Pieces mostly on apartheid, prison conditions, and other South African affairs that Pogrund wrote for major magazines such as the <title render="italic">
                     Economist
                  </title>, the <title render="italic">
                     New Republic
                  </title>, and the <title render="italic">
                     Nation
                  </title> comprise the small Journal articles section.</p>
               <p>Newspaper articles document Pogrund's extensive writing for several papers in South Africa, England, and the United States, but predominantly for the <title render="italic">
                     Boston Globe
                  </title> and the <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title>. Most of the writings are clippings and are sorted only by year. Separate folders documenting his work in 1960-1961 as African affairs reporter and his 1982 trip to Israel are listed with other chronologically arranged <title render="italic">
                     Rand Daily Mail
                  </title> materials.</p>
               <p>Seven folders of speeches, most of which address South African affairs and journalism, are arranged chronologically. An address to the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the death of Robert Sobukwe highlights the section.</p>
