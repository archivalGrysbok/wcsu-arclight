         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Vernon Lyman Kellogg, who was born in December 1, 1867 in Emporia, Kansas, earned both his B.A. in 1889 and his M.A. in 1892 at the University of Kansas, where he was assistant, then associate professor of entomology from 1890 to 1894. He continued his studies in biology at universities in Leipzig, Paris, the University of California, and Brown University, before completing his D. Sc. at Oberlin in 1922. From 1894 through 1920, he was professor of entomology and bionomics at Stanford University, but he took a leave for humanitarian work with American relief efforts in Europe during and after World War I. Herbert Hoover, a longtime friend, appointed him as the director of the Commission for the Relief in Belgium (CRB), where he served from 1915 to 1916. His wife, Charlotte, was the only woman member of the CRB before the U.S. intervention in the war.</p>
         <p>Charlotte Hoffman, whom Vernon Kellogg married in Florence on April 27, 1908, was born in 1874, at Grand Island, Nebraska, of Swiss parents. She was a graduate of the University of California, earning a Ph.B. in 1900, and also studied abroad. For many years, she headed the English Department at Anna Head's School in Berkeley, California. She went to Brussels in 1916 during World War I by permission of the German government to join her husband and worked with the Comission for Relif in Belgium for a year. She was prominent in war relief work as a speaker and fund raiser.</p>
         <p>Herbert Hoover appointed Vernon Kellogg as assistant to the U.S. Food Administrator. Kellogg was chief of the mission to Poland (1917-1919) and special investigator in Russia and other European countries with the American Relief Administrator (1918-1921). From 1919 to 1931, he was permanent secretary of the National Research Council, Washington, D.C., becoming secretary emeritus in 1933.</p>
         <p>In 1921, Charlotte Kellogg was sent to Europe by President Harding to escort Marie Curie to the United States to receive a gram of radium and a special research grant. She directed the Paderewski Testimonial Fund for Polish relief and was involved in a Polish hospital that had been created in Edinburgh for the care of Polish refugees. She was decorated by France, Belgium and Poland for her service to those countries. She was the author of several books about Belgium and Poland. After Vernon Kellogg died on August 8, 1937, Charlotte Kellogg continued to live and write in California, where she died on May 8, 1960.</p>
         <p>Charlotte and Vernon Kellogg had one daughter, Jean, who devoted her life to the arts. She studied for three years at the Yale School of Fine Arts and at the Art Students League in New York City and in Washington, D.C. She provided etchings for a book of poetry, <title render="italic">
               The Loving Shepherdess
            </title>, by Robinson Jeffers. Her work was shown in California and New York among other venues and later, she herself ran an art gallery in Monterey, California. She was married on July 31, 1960, to James Dickie, an artist who was known for his cartoons and for his books teaching children how to draw.</p>

               <p>The series is composed largely of correspondence but also includes some reports, clippings, and other materials associated with various subjects. The initial files include correspondence that is arranged chronologically. Among the files of particular correspondents are letters from Herbert Hoover, Ignace Paderewski, Robinson Jeffers, Marie Curie, Merle Armitage, and several publishers. The Paderewski files contain documentation of Charlotte Kellogg's leadership in raising money for Polish relief and her involvement in the the Paderewski Testimonial Fund, which helped purchase medical materials. Between 1917 and the 1930s, the correspondence is with both Vernon and Charlotte Kellogg. From the 1940s to the 1960s, it is largely Charlotte Kellogg's, with some belonging to Jean Kellogg Dickie. The later correspondence is Jean Kellogg Dickie's.</p>

               <p>This series contains articles and books with associated correspondence, notes, publicity blurbs, and reviews, related, for the most part, to Charlotte Kellogg's writings. Though Charlotte Kellogg's European relief work involved fund raising lectures, few of these are in the collection.</p>
               <p>The series includes materials concerning Charlotte Kellogg's <title render="italic">
                     Prelude
                  </title>, which describes her childhood and which was published posthumously by her daughter. A book and a few of Vernon Kellogg's articles are available, as is his 1884 ornithological notebook and a joint translation with his wife of Marie Curie's <title render="italic">
                     Pierre Curie.
                  </title> Jean Kellogg Dickie is represented here by an oral history and a lecture. The single example of James Dickie's work is a children's book.</p>

               <p>The awards, bibliographies, clippings, identification items, and memorabilia that comprise this series pertain to both Charlotte and Vernon Kellogg. Many of the awards attest to the humanitarian work of both Kelloggs during World War I. Materials for Jean Kellogg Dickie are found in her scrapbook. The scrapbook contains correspondence and clippings, with information about her personal life and artistic career, including brochures and reviews of her shows. There are interviews with political figures and artists, particularly those in the Monterey, California area where she opened an art gallery. The clippings often contain photographs of her. There are also articles about Charlotte Kellogg, including obituaries, in the scrapbook. Family items include a book written by Vernon's father, and another by his uncle. Memorabilia includes many books given and inscribed by friends and associates, several from their longtime friend, William Allen White.</p>
