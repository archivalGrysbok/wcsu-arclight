         <p>Since its inception in 1701, Yale has had a treasurer to oversee the expenses and income of the college, to keep accurate books of financial affairs, to collect fees from students and others, to advise on investment policy, to solicit and collect gifts, and in many ways to secure the institution's financial well-being. The responsibilities of the office grew over the course of the years. In the early days a treasurer and a steward handled all financial duties. Later years saw the additions of assistant treasurers, financial agents, cashiers, bursars, comptrollers, clerks, legal counsel, investment counselors, and real estate agents.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The massive sub-record group of Finance and Administration known as the Treasurer's Records (RU 151) contains the largest continuous set of records in the Yale Archives. Records from 1701 - 1971 document every facet of Yale's financial history. Included in the sub-group are the general summaries of receipts and expenditures and the minute details of charges to a student for breakage in the chemistry lab or the cost of a bath-tub fixture in Jonathan Edwards College.</p>
         <p>From the beginning of its history in 1701 Yale has had a treasurer to oversee the expenses and income of the college, to keep accurate books of the financial affairs, to collect fees from students and others, to advise on investment policy, to solicit and collect gifts, and in many other ways to secure the institution's financial well-being. (See appendix A for a complete list of names and dates of Yale's treasurers, 1701 - 1971.) The responsibilities of the office grew over the course of the more than two centuries covered by these records. In the early days a treasurer and steward could handle all duties. These records chart the additions of assistant treasurers, financial agents, cashiers, bursars, comptrollers, clerks, legal counsel, investment counselors, and real estate agents, all to enable the treasurer's office to handle the ever increasing work load.</p>
         <p>The complexity of the treasurer's duties is reflected in the records kept by the office and in the arrangement established for these records. The arrangement does not establish specifically what office or department under the treasurer generated which records (as would be correct archival procedure). This would have been impossible to establish since the records had no markings to indicate the office of origin. The records are now arranged in six series.</p>
         <p>Series I, GENERAL ACCOUNTING BOOKS, contains the records created to account for all
receipts and expenses of the college, both in summary form on an annual basis, as in the reports to
the Yale Corporation, and on a day-to-day, item-by-item basis, as in the cash journals. Series II,
BURSAR'S RECORDS, contains those records connected with the levying and collecting of student
fees. Series III, CORRESPONDENCE, includes both incoming and outgoing letters dealing with all
facets of the treasurer's office. Series IV, BENEFACTORS, encompasses the histories, registers,
and other records, including wills, relating to gifts, donations, and bequests to the university. Series
V, INVESTMENTS, includes the accounts of real estate, stocks and bonds, and other securities
owned by the university and the reckoning of the income, i. e., rent, dividends, and interest,
generated by these investments. Series VI, CONSTRUCTION RECORDS, is composed of
contracts, specifications, estimates, bills, and other materials gathered in the oversight of the
erection of Yale buildings. Each of the series is divided into numerous sub-series and further into sections. The contents and arrangement of each of these series is described in greater detail in the relevant series description.</p>
         <p>Though the records span the period 1701 - 1971, the great bulk of material dates from 1833 - 1939. The sparse records in the early years can be explained in part by the passage of time and the erratic, often idiosyncratic nature of bookkeeping at that time. Later Yale treasurers instituted more and more standardized, careful practices for recording all necessary detail for an expanding institution. The unexpectedly small size of the twentieth-century records might stem from a greater willingness on the part of later treasurers to dispose of non-current records in order to create space in crowded offices.</p>
         <p>Beginning in the 1930s the treasurer's office began depositing the records of this sub-group in the Yale University Library. Previous to that the records had been in the treasurer's office and were moved from building to building as the office moved. No doubt some records were lost in moves that took the personnel of the treasurer's office from the Trumbull Gallery (later called the Treasury Building) to Woodbridge Hall, Byers Hall, and 451 College Street.</p>
         <p>The records sat for many years unorganized; though several archivists attempted to design a plan of arrangement, the great quantity of records (nearly 400 feet) frustrated these plans for processing. In 1979 when a plan of arrangement for the Yale Archives was instituted and record group numbers assigned, the treasurer's records were classified under the records of Finance and Administration (YRG 5-B). They were given the designation YRG 5-B (later reclassed as RU 151) to reflect the fact that in 1977 the treasurer's office had been reorganized under the newly designated vice president for finance and administration. (See appendix B for a table of organization for Finance and Administration.) The plan of arrangement made RU 151 a closed sub-group; since no new records would in future be added the records could be processed completely and finally. The records in RU 151 include only those treasurer's records on deposit in the library prior to 1979.</p>
         <p>It should be noted that the vice president for finance and administration and the offices under him retained many financial records, similar to those in this sub-group, which date prior to 1979. As the archives receives these records they will be incorporated into archival record groups according to the new classification scheme, by office of origin. Therefore, audit work papers (1967-1980) received by the archives in October, 1980, are now filed under Auditing, YRG 5-C, though the same type of records are included in Series I of of YRG 5-B. Similarly an accession of real estate files (1940-1979) received in February, 1980, is now filed in YRG 5-A while real estate files, ca. 1722-1930, are included in Series V of YRG 5-B. (See appendix C for an outline of all the sub-record groups in YRG5.) No materials received from functioning offices will ever be added to RU 151.</p>
         <p>The treasurer's office deposited many records with the archives that were technically not the records of the treasurer but had presumably been stored in the office for safekeeping or for lack of a better place to put them. A large number of letters to and from President Ezra Stiles came with these records but were removed from the records years ago. These are now part of the Ezra Stiles Papers in the Beinecke Rare Book Library. The Connecticut Education Society Records (# 1242), the Yale Gymnasium Corporation Records (# 1243), and the York Square Trustees Records (# 1250) now exist as separate distinct manuscript groups, each with its own register. Other records have been transferred to appropriate records groups in the Yale Archives.</p>
         <p>Manuscripts and Archives has personal papers for several Yale treasurers, and these papers may contain additional records of the treasurer's office. See appendix A for a list of personal papers of Yale treasurers in Manuscripts and Archives.</p>
         <p>All appendices referred to in the the description of the papers are available only in the print version of the finding aid. Please consult the reference archivist for assistance.</p>

               <p>GENERAL ACCOUNTING BOOKS contains the records of the treasurer, which show, both in summary and in detail, all receipts and expenses of the college. The series is divided into four sub-series, as follows:</p>

               <p>The first sub-series contains those records which summarize the college's finances on a year-by-year basis. The records in the second and third sub-series were generated on a day-to-day basis and reflect different systems of accounting employed during the dates of the respective sub-series.</p>

                     Annual Reports and Audits
                  </title> (1776-1967) begins with the abstracted annual reports and the fuller annual audit reports from which they were extracted. Both are annual accounts of receipts and expenditures organized alphabetically by account. Each report was scrutinized and then signed by the auditor, before being presented to the Prudential Committee and Yale Corporation. The sub-series includes manuscript copies of the annual audit reports from 1829 - 1902. (A form of earlier annual accounts is filed in sub-series <title render="italic">
                     1701 - 1832
                  </title>)</p>
               <p>The corporation voted at its September, 1829 meeting, to print for the first time, a report on the financial state of the college. A complete set of these printed copies of the <title render="italic">
                     Treasurer's Report
                  </title> from 1829/30 to the present is available in the Manuscripts and Archives reading room catalogued as Y31. B1. The only printed copies of these reports now kept with the treasurer's Records are those containing special annotations and those with additional reports from the auditor, such as reports relating to cash control, matters of internal control, revisions of the accounting system, or surveys of accounting and budgetary procedures. These printed copies and supplemental reports follow the manuscript copies. There are also detailed statements of the treasurer's report filed here.</p>
               <p>The sub-series concludes with statements of college accounts submitted to the Connecticut General Assembly and working papers used in the preparation of these annual statements. The college reported to the General Assembly to show it how state funds appropriated for the benefit of the college were being used.</p>
               <p>The sub-series <title render="italic">
                     1701 - 1832
                  </title> encompasses the records of the college's early and rather primitive and erratic bookkeeping system. The records span the tenure of several treasurers, but the total quantity for this period is scant. During the period the treasurer was not the only administrative official handling and recording receipts and expenditures, and this sub-series also includes accounts kept by the president, assistant treasurer and steward.</p>
               <p>For most of this early period the major record of financial transactions is a ledger, often referred to as "Treasury Book A". Successive treasurers and other college officials made entries in this volume, which was then presented to the Corporation for approval. The most consistent account is that with the president and fellows of Yale College. These accounts serve as both a daily record and an annual reckoning. The volume also contains stewards" accounts and accounts with various individuals. An index in the beginning serves as a directory to these different accounts. The sub-series contains the original and two photocopies of this important volume.</p>
               <p>Though the dates of "Treasury Book A" span the years 1701 - 1828 the volume does not include all accounts for this period. Following "Treasury Book A" are several other ledgers that either fill in accounts missing from or overlapping accounts in "Treasury Book A". Accompanying these ledgers are many supporting vouchers for the recorded transactions.</p>
               <p>In 1803 Stephen Twining became assistant treasurer, but it is unclear how Twining and Treasurer James Hillhouse defined their respective duties. Until 1810 Hillhouse was in Washington serving in Congress. It appears that Hillhouse's duties as treasurer were advisory and that much of the work devolved upon Twining. The accounts in Twining's hand are definitely more numerous. Three ledgers kept by Twining date from 1805 until his death in 1832. Some of the confusion of duties may be reflected in an annual statement of the account between Hillhouse and Twining in order to keep the books in balance.</p>
               <p>The sub-series includes two cash journals, an account book that became a standard form for recording each credit and debit. One of these journals is in the hand of William G. Hooker, a clerk in the office who assumed the management of operations after the death of Twining. The sub-series also includes a volume of trial balances. This form of daily balancing of income and expense also became a standard bookkeeping procedure later. The two registers of orders drawn on the treasurer are similar to counterfoils of checkbooks. They list by account the check or order drawn on that account. These registers date to 1837, but this form does not seem to have been continued.</p>
               <p>The sub-series concludes with several scattered accounts supplied by the steward for expenses incurred in providing food for the commons and in paying sweepers of college rooms and receipts of payments for these services. (The actual accounting of individual student bills and payments for board and sweeping are found in Series II.) Since Stephen Twining served as steward as well as assistant treasurer his steward's accounts are found interwoven in his ledgers and are not distinguishable separately.</p>
               <p>Both James Hillhouse and Stephen Twining died in 1832. At the May, 1833, meeting of the Yale Corporation the Prudential Committee and the new treasurer, Wyllys Warner, were directed to "devise and report a proper scheme for the management of the Treasury Department." The growing complexity of treasury accounts, including separate books for the Medical Institution and the Theological Department, bookkeeping for the more aggressive fund raising projects and the complete change of personnel in the treasurer's office made 1833 an ideal time for instituting a new system of accounts. The new system would be modified and expanded but certain basic forms can be traced from 1833 to the present. The sub-series <title render="italic">
                     1833 - 1971
                  </title> includes the records of the new system.</p>
               <p>It is unfortunate that Wyllys Warner's report on the new "proper scheme" was not recorded in the corporation minutes since a first hand explanation of the workings of the system would have produced a clearer understanding of these records. The newly instituted system followed the developing method of double- entry bookkeeping and involved the use of daybooks, cash journals, and summary journals and ledgers to record all transactions as well as trial balances and balance sheets to test the accuracy of the books and summarize the financial situation from day to day, month to month, and year to year. All of these types of books are represented in the sub-series <title render="italic">
                     1833 - 1971
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>The most detailed record of transactions will be found in the daybooks and cash journals and their supporting vouchers. Daybooks were the books of original entry for every transaction; each transaction was recorded as it occurred. The cash journals are a similar chronological recording of all monies received and paid out but with debits arranged on a facing page from the credits and in later years in separate volumes for cash receipts and cash disbursements.</p>
               <p>All the supporting vouchers, in the form of bills and receipts, have been placed after the cash journal in which they are recorded. The vouchers are arranged as they appear on the page of the cash journal and not by the date of the bill, since bills were often paid many months after they were issued. There is not a complete set of vouchers for any cash journal and after 1884 there are none at all. For any one year an estimated 70% of the bills have survived. There are far fewer receipts. Only for the fiscal year 1883/84 are the bills nearly complete.</p>
               <p>Two types of balance books were found in this period, "trial balances" and "cash settlements". It is not clear exactly why the two types were needed. It may be that the "trial balances" balanced monies recorded in the cash journal and that the "cash settlements" were used to keep account of several different cash accounts. Entries such as "American Education Society" or "Trinity Church" lead one to surmise that some monies passed through the hands of the Yale treasurer but were neither debits nor credits on the Yale books and that the Yale treasurer acted as a collecting agent only.</p>
               <p>The general journals and ledgers that follow in the sub-series are the backbone of the double entry system. The general journal is a summary chronological recording device for all transactions; transactions are classified as debits and credits according to the accounts to which they will be posted in the ledger. Entries in the journal and postings in the ledger indicate page numbers which cross reference one to the other. The ledger contains a summary record of the transactions but it is
arranged according to account and then chronologically within that account. Ledgers have an index to enable the user to find the needed account. The Treasurer's Records contain paper copies of both journals and ledgers only to 1912. The twentieth century volumes were quite large and bulky and were, therefore, microfilmed, after which the originals were destroyed. (See appendix D for a guide to the microfilm.) The balance sheets, some yearly, some monthly, which were prepared from the
ledgers to show the condition of each account, follow.</p>

                  </title> sub-series concludes with a few miscellaneous books, including the treasurer's schedules and memoranda books. There is also a curious ledger and journal for what seems to be a short-lived Yale bank for individual depositors in the mid-1840s. The large volumes in <title render="italic">

               <p>The bursar collected all students payments including those for tuition, room, board, gymnasium, laboratory, health and graduation fees. BURSAR'S RECORDS contains the records of the collection of these fees from 1727-1941 even though the actual office of the bursar was not created until 1897.</p>
               <p>In the first two centuries of the college's existence student fees were collected either by the treasurer, assistant treasurer, or steward. As the university grew so did the burden on the treasurer, and in an attempt to relieve him the university established the bursar's office. At first the bursar was asked to handle those duties of the treasurer "connected with the daily working and expenditures of the Academical Department" (from the President's Report, 1897). The fees collected by the professional schools were still recorded by the treasurer. Later, as reported in the 1911/1912 treasurer's report, the office of University Bursar was created to collect "all the term bills and other accounts of students in the Academical Department and Professional Schools."</p>
               <p>The series is divided into the following sub-series:</p>

                     Yale College Student Accounts
                  </title> includes all records of fees collected from all Yale students before 1813 (when the Medical School opened) and after that date from only those students working towards a B.A. degree. The sub-series is perhaps the most complete record in all the treasurer's Records. The accounts are somewhat scattered in the eighteenth century but are nearly continuous from 1770 on.</p>
               <p>The sub-series begins with a sample of the certificate of admission forms. When the treasurer received this form he could proceed to collect a bond, usually from the student's parent or guardian, to assure the college that payment would be made for student bills. A large file of these bonds, both the handwritten and printed forms, are arranged here alphabetically by the student's name.</p>
               <p>At each billing period the treasurer would list each class separately and would record the charge levied against individual class members in a volume of "term bill charges". The format of these volumes varied over the years: it always included tuition costs but at times also specified charges for study rent, sweeping, glass, damages, catalogues, room, wood, sawing, pew rent, gymnasium fees, language courses, heat, dining hall, library, and chemistry. A sample of the actual bills as sent to individual students follows the volumes of term bill charges. When the treasurer received a payment he would record it chronologically in a volume called either a daybook or blotter and in later years a journal. He would also enter a record of payment in the ledgers containing the individual student accounts. Original journals and ledgers to 1911 are filed in this sub-series. After that date the university bursar began keeping all such records together with similar records for students in the professional schools. These records are now all on MICROFILM HM 96. (See appendix D for a guide to this microfilm.)</p>

                     Other Student Accounts
                  </title> includes all records of fees collected from students other than those enrolled in Yale College. There are some records for each of the following schools: Divinity, Forestry, Graduate, Law, Medicine, and Music. These records are usually in the form of journals and ledgers, and at first each school kept its own books. Books containing a consolidated record for students of all these schools exist from 1896 on. These are referred to as the "general books". (The general books, after 1911, are all on MICROFILM HM 96. See appendix D.) Only in some of the later general books can one find any reference to payments for Sheffield Scientific School students. The later general ledgers also contain accounts for some of the faculty and Yale students organizations.</p>

                     Rooms Accounts
                  </title> includes records of the occupation of college dormitory rooms as well as of payments for room rents. Since rent varied from room to room the treasurer kept both a "location book" by room number to record the name of the occupants and a charge and payment record in the form of bill books, journals, and ledgers. This sub-series is small; most of the actual records of receipts for rent were recorded with the other student payments in the student accounts ledgers and journals.</p>

                     Scholarships
                  </title> contains memoranda, lists, registers of scholarship recipients, and receipt books. These records served to remind the treasurer to reduce term bill charges to scholarship recipients and to annotate the books of the various scholarship funds to indicate the withdrawals for payments. The sub-series is certainly not a complete record of all scholarship recipients, though the receipt books do form a complete record for the period they cover. These receipt books also contain the record of payments for the salaries of student monitors and of faculty from 1865 to 1896. (Student monitors received a salary for recording students who were tardy or absent from chapel or other required exercises.) These salary receipts may be the only source of information on the salary of individual faculty members since the ordinarily specific cash journals (in Series I) for the same time period are much less detailed. The sub-series also includes fund ledgers in which the treasurer recorded any transaction relating no the income and expenditures of each scholarship fund.</p>
               <p>CORRESPONDENCE (Series III) contains much that relates to these bursar's records including an abundance of letters from parents and guardians concerning payment of students bills. The sub-series <title render="italic">
                     Filing Code
                  </title> contains several relevant files: #24 - Bursar's office; #184 - Tuition abatement; #189 - Aid for students; #217 - Tuition rebates; and #381 - student bills, loans, scholarships. There are also numerous files for specific scholarships and prizes.</p>

               <p>CORRESPONDENCE is the largest series in the treasurer's Records and spans the terms of thirteen Yale treasurers. Because of its massive size the series is arranged in nine sub-series as follows:</p>

                  </blockquote>
               <p>Many of the chronological divisions between sub-series represent changes in filing systems instituted as new treasurers took office. Where possible the original plan of organization was retained.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1717 - 1832
                  </title>contains small amounts of correspondence from the administrations of John Prout, Roger Sherman, and John Trumbull, but the majority dates from the term of James Hillhouse. During Hillhouse'sincumbancy he also served in Congress, and while he was in Washington he depended on Stephen Twining, the assistant treasurer, to carry out the responsibilities of the office. Although the correspondence does include a few letters that Hillhouse wrote to Twining concerning the college'sfinancial business and events in Washington, most of the correspondence is actually Twining"s. Following Twining'sdeath in 1832 William G. Hooker served as acting treasurer. Several letters at the end of 1832 are addressed to him. The sub-series concludes with Twining'sletterbooks containing copies of his outgoing letters and notes on letters to be sent.</p>
               <p>The correspondence is arranged chronologically. Much of the correspondence is of a most routine nature concerning term bill payments, mortgage loans and payments, real estate negotiations, gifts to the college, collection of subscription pledges, letters from the contributors to the Benevolent Society or the Society for the Education of Indigent Pious Young Men, and occasional letters of parental protest concerning college discipline. John C. Calhoun sent two letters concerning his son's term bills, and Stephen Ball wrote concerning land sales in New Haven. Benjamin Hinman, a college agent, wrote concerning college land in Holland, Vermont. Between 1805 and 1807 Benjamin Silliman sent reports from Europe concerning his purchases of mathematical and optical apparatus. There are letters concerning the bequest of Elizabeth Talcott, the estate of Betsy Pratt, and the donation of Sheldon Clark. There are also several documents concerning the suit brought against the university by Daniel Potter and others on behalf of the Congregational Society of Plymouth. The society had invested in the failed Eagle Bank, a project which had Yale'sbacking. See also the correspondence with Asa Bacon on this suit. On February 2, 1832, John Trumbull wrote concerning drawings for the proposed Trumbull Gallery.</p>

                     Letterbooks
                  </title> contains all bound copies of outgoing letters from 1833-1906. (Letterbooks belonging to Stephen Twining (1806 - 1832) are in <title render="italic">
                     1717 - 1832
                  </title>). These volumes contain either handwritten or letterpress copies. They are arranged in chronological order. There are no gaps between volumes, but it seems that the files are not complete before 1890.</p>

                  <title render="italic">
                     Financial Agents' Correspondence
                  </title> encompasses the letters received by the college'sfinancial agents, who were active in the various fund raising campaigns, between 1817 and 1841. Most letters concern the Centum Mille Fund. Chief among the agents of this fund was Wyllys Warner who traveled extensively. A letter from President Jeremiah Day gives him advice where to travel: "I have never had any high expectations of aid to the college south of Baltimore; or perhaps I ought to say New York." Warner also received correspondence from the other fund agents. Especially interesting is a report by Seth Bliss on his travels. Warner'scorrespondence as agent ends in 1832, though the Centum Mille Fund drive continued beyond this date. Since Warner was made treasurer in 1833, similar letters concerning fund raising activities addressed to him between 1833 and 1840 are filed in the sub-series <title render="italic">
                     1833-1840
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Of interest also in <title render="italic">
                     Financial Agents' Correspondence
                  </title> are letters to David Daggett about fund raising for the law professorship and letters to Chauncey Goodrich about the Gibbs professorship and theological fund. Henry L. Ellsworth wrote Goodrich respecting his plans for a sizeable donation. Of particular note is a letter to Benjamin Silliman from Thomas S. Grimke declining to contribute to the Centum Mille Fund because of his concern for the state of property and credit "among us." His letter reflects his concern about what the passage of South Carolina's nullification of tariffs might mean for the future.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1833-1840
                  </title> begins with one folder of letters addressed to William G. Hooker, who served as acting treasurer after the death of Stephen Twining and later in the absence of treasurer Wyllys Warner. In fact there are several letters from Warner detailing his travels. Since Hooker was also in charge of the art gallery there are several letters to him concerning the Trumbull Gallery and donations to it. A letter from Jared Sparks concerns a portrait of Major Andre. The folder also contains occasional copies of Hooker's outgoing letters.</p>
               <p>Following the folder of Hooker correspondence are all letters addressed to treasurer Warner. The letters are arranged in alphabetical order with the letters from a small number of select correspondents filed individually. Much of this correspondence is routine, being the usual letters concerning subscription pledges, mortgage negotiations, payment of college bills, and letters from renters, lawyers, and executors. The select correspondents tend to be those whose letters are more significant or more voluminous. Thus letters from long term renters may be filed under the name of the correspondent rather than in the general file.</p>
               <p>There are many letters from field agents raising funds for the college. Amos S. Chesebrough, an agent who travelled across Connecticut, wrote, "I have seen the "Adventures of a Traveler," the "Confessions of a Schoolmaster," and "Caleb in Search of a Wife," but I think that a volume entitled," An Agent in Pursuit of Money," would be as replete with incidents as any of them. The agents, Erastus Colton, Darius Mead, Thomas Perkins, and Mason Whiting traveled through New England and New York and wrote of their experiences. A sentiment common to their letters was "things look dark here."</p>
               <p>Among other interesting letters are those from William Lawrence concerning college land in Norfolk and from Mills Olcott concerning property in Vermont received through Dr. Nathan Smith's mortgage. There are many letters from John Trumbull, most merely acknowledging the quarterly payment of his annuity. William G. Hooker's letters to the absent Wyllys Warner describe the day to day functioning of the treasurer's office. At the end of the sub-series is one folder of correspondence of others which is addressed to neither Warner, Hooker, nor any college agent yet concerns the finances of the college.</p>
               <p>The correspondence for the period 1841-1888 covers part of the term of Wyllys Warner and the complete terms of E. C. Herrick and Henry Colt Kingsley. The quantity of correspondence for this period reflects the rapid growth of the college. There is a noticeable increase in quantity after the Civil War, and one may attribute this partly to Yale's increased interest in investments and land holdings in the developing West. The reader will note that there is very little correspondence from 1886-1888. During this time President Dwight served as acting treasurer, assisted by L. E. Osborn, and it is possible that some treasurer's correspondence found its way into Dwight's presidential or personal papers.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1841-1888: General,
                  </title> consisting almost entirely of incoming letters and only occasional copies of outgoing letters, is divided by year and is arranged alphabetically within each yearly division. (For outgoing letters of this period see the sub-series <title render="italic">
                     Letterbooks.
                  </title>) This correspondence contains much that is routine and deals with the treasurer's standard responsibilities: students" term bills, loans and mortgages, rent collection, real estate purchase and upkeep, college expenses, building plans, and legal problems involved in gifts and estates" settlements. There are also many subscriptions for the various fund raising campaigns such as the Library Fund, the Woolsey Fund, the funds to purchase Judge Hitchcock'slibrary and to erect a statue to Benjamin Silliman. The correspondents tend to be alumni, parents of students, faculty members, benefactors, salesmen, potential borrowers, debtors, tenants, real estate agents, brokers, insurance agents, merchants, and lawyers.</p>
               <p>Because E. C. Herrick for a period served as both treasurer and librarian, some correspondence addressed to the librarian is also filed in this sub-series. No attempt has been made to separate those letters concerning gifts to the library, requests for catalogues and copies of obituary records, or information on book orders and subscriptions.</p>
               <p>Correspondence of selected individuals from this period has been collected and segregated and now comprises <title render="italic">
                     1841-1888 : Select
                  </title>. A sizeable number of letters from Russell Sturgis, the architect for several buildings on the Old Campus, are included in this sub-series. Other campus architects represented here include Richard Hunt and Peter Wight. (Correspondence from Frederick Withers, George Hawthorne, and J. A. Mould, ca. 1866-1868, all unsuccessful entrants in the chapel competition, will be found in <title render="italic">
                     1841-1888: General.
                  </title>)</p>
               <p>Correspondence concerning several notable gifts should also be noted. Under the will of Henry L. Ellsworth Yale inherited extensive property in Indiana. There is much correspondence from Elizur Goodrich as trustee of this estate. In 1878 Timothy Dwight Porter conveyed to Yale, subject to an annuity, a block in Manhattan bounded by 36th and 37th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues. The files are filled with correspondence concerning the transfer and the mortgage and rental of this property. See especially the correspondence with Thomas Thacher and Theodore W. Dwight. Correspondence with Joseph Sheffield concerns another important gift, that providing for the Sheffield Scientific School. Other correspondence relating to special gifts will be found under the names of James Jackson Jarves, Frederick Marquand, and John Trumbull.</p>
               <p>During this period the treasurer shared some of his increasing responsibilities with faculty members in the various schools. Thus there is correspondence with Benjamin Silliman concerning financing scientific improvements, with Simeon E. Baldwin and Francis Wayland concerning the law school, with John F. Weir concerning the school of fine arts, with Robert Brown concerning the observatory, and with C. A. Lindsley concerning the medical school.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1888-1901
                  </title> consists of the complete incoming letter files of William Whitman Farnam and partial files of Morris Franklin Tyler. Cashier William C. Rowland also received some of the more routine letters in this correspondence. This extensive run of letters, originally filed alphabetically in 37 chronological letterboxes is now arranged in one alphabetical order with individual files for selected correspondents interspersed throughout. The topics discussed in these letters are much the same as those in the <title render="italic">
                     1841 - 1888
                  </title>sub-series though the quantity of letters is nearly six times greater.</p>
               <p>Predominant among the select correspondents are the names of investment counselors, real estate agents, and bankers, who assisted the treasurer in the increasingly complex task of managing the university'sincome producing funds. The largest amount of such correspondence concerns the firm of Peabody, Houghteling, &amp; Co., but much investment correspondence will be found with the firms of: Baring Brothers; Cammann &amp; Co. concerning management of New York City real estate; N. P. Dodge &amp; Co.; W. T. Hatch &amp; Sons; Lewis Investment Co.; E. S. Rouse; and Winslow, Lanier, and Co.</p>
               <p>The treasurers of the period also oversaw a major building campaign. Consequently the names of several prominent architects and firms (Cady, Berg &amp; See; Carrere &amp; Hastings; Walter B. Chambers; E. E. Gandolfo; Charles C. Haight; Howells &amp; Stokes; and L. W. Robinson) appear in these files along with correspondence from contractors and suppliers of hardware, furniture, and scientific apparatus.</p>
               <p>As in the other sub-series there is correspondence concerning bequests and gifts to the university. Bissell, Carey and Cooke wrote concerning the settlement of the Lampson estate and the firm of Boardman and Boardman handled the Joseph A. Christman estate. Bristol, Stoddard and Bristol advised the university on legal matters including wills. There is a file for the Daniel B. Fayerweather estate, and correspondence with Thomas Thacher concerning the Miriam A. Osborn estate. There is one file about the estate of Thomas G. Sloane. Correspondence with Harper &amp; Brothers and with Francis and Henry Loomis all relates to the Yale treasurer's role as executor of the Elias Loomis estate. The sub-series also includes letters from individuals concerning their contributions to the Alumni University Fund, and from about 1900 - 1901 the files are full of subscriptions to the Yale Bi-centennial Fund. Some of these letters are addressed to Andrew W. Phillips who served as secretary to the Bi-centennial Fund Committee.</p>
               <p>The treasurer corresponded steadily with certain university officials, notably Timothy Dwight, mainly during the president's summer vacation away from the university. Letters were also received from university secretary Anson Phelps Stokes; Simeon Baldwin concerning the law school; George J. Brush, Russell Chittenden, and Henry S. Graves concerning the new forestry school; President Arthur T. Hadley; John F. Weir concerning the school of fine arts; and Robert Brown and W. L. Elkin relating to the university observatory.</p>
               <p>During this period the University created the office of the bursar to relieve the treasurer of many ordinary matters. Correspondence in this sub-series reveals the treasurer still handling some questions concerning student accounts and payments to the faculty and staff. There are also the usual requests for information and applications for employment. During 1901 there were numerous inquiries concerning equipment and staff for the new commons. Correspondence of this routine nature will all be found in the general files in this sub-series.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1902 - 1906
                  </title> contains correspondence files maintained for parts of the terms of treasurers Morris Franklin Tyler and Lee McClung. The arbitrary dates of the sub-series correspond with the original office filing scheme. The correspondence, which was originally filed in chronological letter boxes, is now arranged in one alphabetical order with individual files for select correspondents interspersed throughout.</p>
               <p>Many of the topics covered and the correspondents included in this sub-series parallel those in the previous sub-series. Great quantities of investment correspondence are available to the researcher interested in Yale's financial assets in real estate, stocks and bonds. Construction projects begun at the turn of the century reached completion in this period; substantial correspondence with architects, contractors, and equipment suppliers documents these projects, particularly the new commons.</p>
               <p>Aside from the usual correspondence concerning student accounts, internal university finances, and gifts and bequests to the university, there is interesting correspondence relating to the university'srelations with the city of New Haven. Land development in the city limits, police and safety, and taxation of university property are all discussed in these letters.</p>
               <p>From about 1907 through the late 1930s the letters received by the treasurer's office were filed by subject according to a numerical code. This arrangement has been retained for the 156 boxes of correspondence which now comprise <title render="italic">
                     Filing Code
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>The filing code was a system that developed over the period of its use. In the beginning the treasurer established several categories of important correspondence and gave each category a number: #3 stood for investments; letters concerning mortgages were filed under #5; and all real estate matters would be found under #10. Sometimes letters prior to 1907 were added to the appropriate code to make a complete subject file. As the treasurer established new categories he gave them the next consecutive number.</p>
               <p>As time went by and new personnel began filing materials according to their own understanding of how the system worked, they introduced many quirks and idiosyncrasies. Code numbers were assigned to very specific categories when general categories were already in existence. Therefore, though #5 contains correspondence on mortgages #47 is the code for mortgages: Nebraska. The creation of numerous small categories such as #319: Night Watchman, 1909 May-Jun, make the system extremely cumbersome; the entire code now runs to 597 numbers. Furthermore, the brief descriptive titles assigned to correspond with the numbers are often too imprecise or vague to make them useful. The use of descriptions like "Motion Pictures" or "Waterproofing" exemplifies this problem.</p>
               <p>The arrangement is not only confusing; it also makes location and retrieval of specific materials very difficult. The researcher is confronted with a long, random list of files which has to be scanned in its entirety to locate all material on a particular subject. Fortunately some cross-referencing has been done in several of the other series to appropriate codes in this sub-series.</p>
               <p>It is unfortunate that the filing system is so peculiar for there is a wealth of information to be found in these files. There is hardly a subject of concern to the university in which the treasurer was not in some way involved and during the majority of this period George Parmly Day, a man active in many phases of university life, served as treasurer. Vast quantities of investment correspondence concerning university-owned real estate, stocks, bonds, other securities, and mortgages, abound in these files. Numerous codes contain material on university benefactors especially relating to estates and to the establishment of scholarships, special funds, and student prizes. In the general area of university administration and operations the researcher will find files for the bursar's office, various departments and schools, and broad files regarding taxes, accounting procedures, and legal affairs, as well as general files for the upkeep of buildings and grounds and files concerning the construction, maintenance, and alterations of individual buildings. Of particular interest are the files at the very end of the sub-series concerning the finances of the Doura-Europos expeditions.</p>

                     General Histories
                  </title> is composed of compilations of information on the history of gifts to Yale. Most of the histories give a chronological list of donors along with the amounts and stipulations on the donation. Of particular interest is a volume in the hand of Ezra Stiles and others which contains, in addition to a list of gifts, lists of the library'sholdings and of philosophical apparatus, copies of honorary degrees, and the wording of the diplomas. The volume called "Histories and stipulations of donations and funds, ca. 1746-1908" is also noteworthy, containing information, duplicated elsewhere, on funds created from 1888-1908. An index in the volume provides an alphabetical list of the included funds. The sub-series is arranged in rough chronological order according to the records" creation dates.</p>

                  <title render="italic">
                     Subscriptions
                  </title> encompasses the records of many campaigns for financial support, both for general endowments and for special purposes, addressed to the multitude of Yale supporters. The records of any particular campaign usually include a list of subscribers with their pledges and may include the purposes and terms of donations, accounts of payments received and pledges unpaid, and notes by campaign agents on their travels and responses to their requests. (The accounting records of income and expenses of some campaigns are found in Series V, INVESTMENTS.)</p>

                     Special Gifts
                  </title> contains records of a few large or unusual gifts made by individuals during their lifetimes. The donations of Richard Salter and Timothy Dwight Porter came in the form of land and are particularly well documented. Salter proposed that the income derived from his gift of a farm in Windham, Connecticut, be used to promote the study of Hebrew and other oriental languages in Yale College. Porter'sgift put the use of a square block of Manhattan real estate under Yale's control. (In CORRESPONDENCE, <title render="italic">
                     1841-1888: Select
                  </title> there are many letters from Thomas Thacher concerning this gift.) Sheldon Clark'sgifts in the form of assigned mortgages were the largest to that point in the college'shistory and created an endowed professorship and the first fellowships for non-professional postgraduate study. The histories of the DeForest, Hillhouse, and Leffingwell scholarship funds are also detailed in this sub-series. Papers respecting the John Trumbull and William Augustus Hillhouse annuities document how Yale came to own its fine collection of John Trumbull paintings and a large quantity of undeveloped real estate in New Haven. The records of the sub-series are arranged alphabetically by name of the donation or fund. (Correspondence concerning individual gifts will be found in CORRESPONDENCE, <title render="italic">

                  <title render="italic">
                     Estates Completed
                  </title> is by far the largest sub-series in this series. Most of the files date from the 1880s to 1950 with a few files earlier and later than these dates. The sub-series contains records of only those estates that had been settled at the time of the last transfer of records from the treasurer's office to Manuscripts and Archives. As of 1979 the sub-series <title render="italic">
                     Estates Completed
                  </title> was closed. Any completed estate papers that were retained by the office after this date, even those dating much earlier, will not be added to this sub-series. Instead they will be considered as part of the records of the Treasury Services (YRG5-E), the office where they are now filed.</p>
               <p>The files in this sub-series are arranged alphabetically by the name of the testator. Most files contain only a copy of the will or a note of what the treasurer reported to the corporation concerning the estate. In some instances there may be court proceedings and accounts compiled by the executors. In a few instances, usually where the treasurer or someone from the university acted as an executor, an estate'srecords may become voluminous. In such cases the files could contain personal papers, executor'scorrespondence, account books, and may other papers that an executor'smight have kept. Examples of such files include those for the estates of Edward Augustus Bowers, Sheldon Clark, Henry L. Ellsworth, William Lampson, Elias Loomis, Edla McPherson, O. C. Marsh, Mary Ann Goodman, and Augustus Russell Street. The files for the Edward S. Harkness estate are also very detailed.</p>
               <p>Though a few items of correspondence will be found in these files most correspondence concerning estates has been filed in the CORRESPONDENCE series. During the years ca. 1907 - 1937 the treasurer kept most correspondence on completed estates in subject files which are now Series III, <title render="italic">
                     Filing Code
                  </title>: #238. A few other estates" correspondence files were filed individually under the name of the estate in this code. The folder list which follows includes cross-references to the appropriate files in the CORRESPONDENCE series.</p>

               <p>INVESTMENTS embraces lists and muniments of Yale's income producing properties (real estate, stocks, bonds, and other securities) and the records of income produced from them (rent, dividends, and interest). The series is divided into three sub-series:</p>

                  <title render="italic">
                     Accounting: Investing Funds
                  </title> includes records from the nineteenth century when several special funds were established as general or specific endowments. The income produced from investments of a fund's resources was to be returned to the university for the perpetuation and extension of its goals.* The accounts in this sub-series reveal the meticulous care taken by the treasurer to keep the records of the various investing funds distinct and well-ordered. Many of the funds represented are the same as those whose subscribers are recorded in the BENEFACTORS series.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     Real Estate
                  </title> includes the records of Yale's income producing land holdings, of the accounts of income derived from rent and land sales and of the expense of maintaining property. The sub-series begins with several folders containing Deeds and Other Records of Land Holdings. At first there are registers or inventories listing properties some of which include explanations of how Yale acquired particular tracts.</p>
               <p>The actual deeds, along with some memoranda, short term leases, notes on improvements, and, occasionally, maps, follow. Ideally such land records should be organized geographically with all records relating to the conveyance of a particular piece of land organized together chronologically. It seems that originally the treasurer did keep the records this way, but over the years the original organization was dismantled. A recent attempt to reorganize these records in this way proved, in large part, impossible, due to the many changes in street names and other boundary definers.</p>
               <p>The deeds, etc., are now arranged only by state and then by city or town. There are, of course, a large number of deeds for Connecticut and some particularly old deeds for college farms in Canaan, Cornwall, Goshen, Kent, and Salisbury. The New Haven deeds fill nine folders and with such a large quantity additional organization was vital. The New Haven deeds are alphabetized by the name of the person (either buyer or seller) transacting business with Yale (except for the deeds which could be easily identified by a locale, e.g., College Square, Grapevine Point, or Oyster Point).</p>
               <p>Included in the folders of Deeds and Other Records of Land Holdings are a few items that could not be distinguished as relating to Yale; neither the buyer nor the seller was Yale. Since these items were preserved by the treasurer presumably they were saved to show some previous conveyance history. They are filed at the very end of the appropriate geographic folder.</p>
               <p>The Long Term Leases have been arranged as a separate section from the Deeds and Other Records of Land Holdings. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Yale commonly let its farms (all in Connecticut) for an extended period, the usual term being 999 years. There may be deeds for some of the parcels of leased property in the preceding section. These oversized leases along with occasional notes and maps are organized by town.</p>
               <p>The Income and Expense section contains all accounts for rent received and funds expended for the upkeep of property. The first several folders marked "rent ledgers" and "rent journals" contain the accounts of individual tenants. In the ledgers each tenant's account is kept and an alphabetical index at the beginning provides name access. Journals give a chronological record of payments received. The rent ledgers and journals are listed in chronological order and are followed by two general property ledgers which record income and expense by property.</p>
               <p>Additional records of property income and expense follow in the form of statements submitted by rental agents and specific property ledgers. The records are organized geographically by state and then by city where the property is located. The listing shows the far reaches of Yale's property investments. Whereas the Deeds and Other Records of Land Holdings show investments through the mid-nineteenth century mainly in New England, New York, and Ohio, the statements from rental agents at the turn of the twentieth century concern property in Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, as well as the added property in Manhattan from the gift of Timothy Dwight Porter. It is difficult to know, though, what proportion of Yale's income producing property is represented by these rental records. Additional statements from agents are included in the CORRESPONDENCE series. See particularly the files for: H. H. Cammann and Peabody, Houghteling, and Co.</p>
               <p>At the end of <title render="italic">
                     Real Estate
                  </title> is a small section of minutes, property ledgers, correspondence, deeds, and other records of the Atheneum Company. Four original subscribers: John N. Bristol, Henry L. Galpin, William R. Pitkin, and J. Dwight Dana, founded this private New Haven company in 1917. Using a sizeable sum loaned by Edward S. Harkness the company proceeded to purchase and then rent property in New Haven in the area of Park, York, and Elm Streets. Within ten years the company began selling off parcels of its land to the university and to several Yale fraternities and secret societies. Then in 1930 the directors agreed to the dissolution of the company. Under an agreement with the university they conveyed a piece of land to Yale without cost provided that Yale would use the property as a site for a memorial to Briton Hadden. How the treasurer of Yale came into possession of the Atheneum Company records is unclear. They are organized here at the end of the <title render="italic">
                     Real Estate
                  </title> sub-series since some of them do pertain to Yale-owned property.</p>
               <p>Found with the treasurer's Records originally were similar papers for the York Square Trustees. Minutes, journals, conveyance records, and other papers, dating from 1834 to 1926 and relating to the trustees" efforts to maintain a residential neighborhood in York Square, comprised the records. Thomas Wells Farnam, Yale's associate treasurer and comptroller, had been one of the trustees. Since, however, the records themselves do not mention any transfer of property to Yale (though probably Yale does own property in York Square now), the York Square Trustees Records were separated from the treasurer's Records and now exist as Manuscript Group #1250.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     Loans and Securities
                  </title> consists of lists of stocks, bonds, and promissory notes held by Yale, of accounts of the purchase of stocks and bonds and the income from their dividends and interest payments, and of mortgage deeds, personal bonds, and other certificates of indebtedness.</p>
               <p>The general descriptive term for stocks, bonds, and personal notes varied over time. In the early years of these records, the term "bills receivable" was commonly accepted. In the Gilded Age when investments in stocks and bonds predominated over personal loans and mortgages the term more often used was "securities". The terminology used in the folder descriptions follows the terminology used on the original record. The lists of stocks, bonds, and personal notes are organized roughly in chronological order. The terms "register" or "catalogue," used to describe records in folders 81 through 89, refer to lists of the stocks, bonds, and notes compiled according to the fund from which the purchase of loan money was drawn and to which the dividend or interest was paid. Toward the end of the 1880s the treasurer started keeping lists not by fund but alphabetically by type of security; here he also recorded each interest or dividend payment. Folders 89 through 96 and folio box IV, folder 18, contain this type of list.</p>

               <p>*When the bookkeeping procedures were changed at the beginning of the twentieth century the accounts of specific funds were incorporated into the general books. See Series I for these books.</p>

               <p>CONSTRUCTION RECORDS contains all treasurer's records, except correspondence, relating to the construction of Yale buildings. These records include not only accounts of the costs of buildings but also more detailed information on the planning, design, and construction of individual buildings. (For additional information on the costs of buildings see also: Series IV, folder 6.) The series is divided chronologically into three sub-series:</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1752-1860
                  </title>

               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     1861-1921
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     Thomas W. Farnam's Building Files
                  </title>(ca. 1921-1941)</p>
               <p>In each of the sub-series the records are arranged by individual building. The designation of building names and the alphabetization of the folders follow the format used in <title render="italic">
                     Buildings and Grounds of Yale University
                  </title> (New Haven, Yale University Printing Service, 1979 September). For any particular building the files may include estimates of costs, contracts and other agreements, specifications, bids, receipts, vouchers, building committee minutes, and accounts of expenditures. Originally these files also contained some architects" drawings and a fair quantity of blueprints. All of these have now been removed from this series and transferred to YRG #46: Architectural Drawings, Buildings and Ground Plans, University Maps.</p>
               <p>The files become progressively more voluminous through the sub-series. The record is scant for <title render="italic">
                     1752-1860
                  </title>, somewhat fuller for <title render="italic">
                     1861-1921
                  </title> and almost overwhelming for Yale's great building boom, ca, 1921-1941. These latter files are referred to as <title render="italic">
                     Thomas W. Farnam's Building Files
                  </title> labour and materials. The bills are arranged by building.</p>
               <p>Series III, CORRESPONDENCE, contains much significant correspondence with the architects of Yale buildings. Particularly important are the large files for Cady, Berg &amp; See; Carrère &amp; Hastings; Charles Haight; and Russell Sturgis. The sub-series <title render="italic">
                     Filing code
                  </title> includes extensive correspondence organized according to building. The folder listing for Series VI incorporates many cross-references to the <title render="italic">
                     Filling Code
                  </title> for the code appropriate to the individual buildings. More general correspondence concerning the overall constructions plans will be found in filing code #188a, #188b, and #411.</p>
