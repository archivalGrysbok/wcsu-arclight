         <p>Andrew St. George was born in Hungary in 1923. He attended Columbia University in the 1950s but never graduated, preferring to find work as a writer and photojournalist in order to support his wife and frequent collaborator, Jean, and their growing family. St. George worked for United States military intelligence in Vienna after World War II. For the rest of his life he worked as an investigative reporter and photographer, especially focusing on Latin America. His interest in that region began when he conducted one of the first full-length interviews with Fidel Castro and members of his guerrilla army in the Sierra Maestra during the fall of 1957. The interview was later published in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Look
            </title> magazine. St. George also published accounts of his time with the guerrillas in <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Coronet
            </title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title>, and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Life
            </title>. During 1959 and most of 1960, St. George lived in Cuba; by the summer of 1960, he had become disillusioned with the Cuban Revolution's authoritarianism. During the next three decades he pursued his career as a photojournalist, including working a number of years at <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Spotlight Magazine
            </title> in Washington, D.C. He had two sons, Andrew and Tom. St. George died on May 2, 2001.</p>

                        <p>The images of guerrillas in Fidel Castro's column are engaged in wartime activities and scenes of everyday life.  The photographs show the preparation of hand-made bombs in a clandestine bomb shop run by a bearded veteran of the Spanish Civil War; guerrillas manning a look-out post from the mountains near El Cobre, Oriente while others are engaged in routine activities such as cleaning a rifle, repairing a uniform with a Singer sewing machine, relaxing with children in the guerrilla camp, enjoying a pig roast, and a man applying talcum powder to a young boy.</p>

                        <p>There are portraits of individual guerrillas including Fidel Castro, Felipe Guerra Matos (in 1957 and January 1959), as well as the later infamous Manuel Piñeiro, better known as Barba Roja.  Piñeiro was chief of Cuba's domestic intelligence service, commonly known as G2, during the 1960s and later a top official in the Sovietized Ministry of the Interior after 1968.  There is a composite and retouched photograph with founders of the first 26th of July guerrilla column in the Sierra Maestra, probably from June 1957.  Included in this photograph are an unknown rebel, Che Guevara (second from left), Universo Sanchez (third from left), Raul Castro (fourth from the left), followed by Fidel Castro (on Raul's left), Crescencio Perez, and Andrew St. George on the far right with his hand on his left hip. The third man on the right on his haunches is Juan Almeida Bosque.  A cropped version of this photograph is in Box 8, folder 2.  One picture shows Fidel with a young couple at his side and bearded guerrillas.  The woman is wearing a fashionable scarf in her hair and full make-up while the man is relatively well-shaven. On the back of this image, St. George includes a caption that says "Pura Pradier, a young Habana musician and concert singer (center) was often seen with Castro after rebel victory.  Here she is shown with him on mountain maneuvers."  There are individual images of Fidel and other unidentified guerrillas, including a young woman inspecting a hand gun and a black Cuban with glasses posing with a rifle.</p>

                        <p>These images document the rebel forces' policy of taxing the owners of local coffee estates in Oriente on the production and processing of each 100-pound bag of coffee.  In one photograph Manuel Boronato, a blonde rebel officer, is shown overseeing the drying of beans, while in another a black officer and a group of armed female guerrillas appear to be involved in the weighing and taxing of each bag.  Also included are photographs of a field hospital for treating local peasants and wounded rebels as well as a school for peasant children in a zone liberated by the forces of Raúl Castro in the summer of 1958.  Most images were taken between October and December 1958 on St. George's last trip to Cuba before the triumph of the Revolution in January 1959.</p>

                        <p>There are images of guerrillas from Raúl Castro's column requisitioning vehicles and stopping cars on the highway for the payment of "tolls" in 1958.  Also included are images of the temporary takeover of a small village called Matías by guerrillas under the command of blond officer Manuel Boronato.  The guerrillas are shown at a small company store, enjoying (for the first time) a juke box, as well as local nighttime activities, such as a vigil held in honor of the Virgin of Charity, with peasants of the region.  There is one print of a group of armed rebels listening to a woman playing the piano that was taken in the first week of January 1959 according to note on the back of the print.  There is also one print of Batista's helmeted forces appearing to attack a rebel hideout.</p>

                        <p>Included among these images are guerrillas taking over major military installations, munitions sites, and police stations on January 1, 1959.  One of the stations was the police headquarters at Guántanamo where a rebel and a former Batistiano soldier can be seen guarding the entrance together.  Castro is seen giving his first speech to the nation from the main plaza at Santiago de Cuba, with Crescenio Pérez at his side and several uniformed Batistiano police standing around him.  Two related images show the crowd listening to the speech.  There are also two prints of Catholic priests who served in the 26th of July underground:  one is Francisco Guzmán who is seen wearing white robe and cross while the other is an unidentified priest, probably a Franciscan. There are several prints of the liberation of a prison where political prisoners were housed in terrible conditions.  There is also a print, taken in Havana most likely, of rebel officer Colonel Darío Rubén de los Santos sharing a happy moment with the Batista officials who appear to be manning a military prison (St. George writes on the back "inside the fortress").</p>

                        <p>The images in this folder focus on Raúl Castro.  In an up-close photograph, he is smiling for the camera while apparently giving a press conference in the early days of January 1959.  On the wall behind him appears a list of radio stations broadcasting the press conference:  CMKC Radio Oriente / CNC Circuito Nacional / CMBC Radio Progreso / CMCF Unión Radio / CMK? (obscured by RC's head) Red Provincial / C???? Radio Min (also obscured).  He is also shown in his first meeting with his fiancée, Vilma Espín, on January 1, 1959, after many months of separation.  One photograph is of an airplane cabin with Raúl Castro and gunmen stationed near the door.</p>

                        <p>All photographs in this folder date from the first week of January 1959.  Included are images of Fidel Castro's caravan of cars and requisitioned tanks making their way westward from Oriente to Havana.  In several images Fidel Castro is shown chatting with nuns as he makes one of his famous impromptu stops along the way.   One photograph includes Castro with several Americans:  Dr. Judson U. McGuire, Jr. (on Castro's right), an entomologist with the United States Department of Agriculture; Jules Dubois (wearing black necktie) of the "Chicago Tribune", and McGuire's daughter wearing a white blouse.  There are also two shots of the airplane that took civilian members of the new government to Havana.  One shows Armando Hart, Haydée Santamaría (his wife), Luis Busch, secretary to President Manuel Urrutia, and José Llanuga, identified as "organ director in the U.S.".  Another image of revolutionaries from the military and civilian wings of the 26th of July movement meeting on the tarmac with a uniformed man described as Major Julio Martínez Paez, a medical doctor (St. George notes on the verso "Min of Health 1st fulltime doc, Havana surgeon").  There is a photograph of a young 18-year-old guerrilla drinking Coca Cola as he guards the entrance to a plane.  St. George identifies this man as Hanibal Hidalgo "son of Mario".  St. George also notes that the young man is doing guard duty as both Fidel Castro and the newly installed President Manuel Urrutia are on the plane.  Two photographs taken at a Presidential Palace cocktail party in Havana show a rebel with Afro-style hair.  On the back of one of these prints, St. George wrote, "At left one of Che Guevara aides allegedly killed with him in Bolivia."  There is a print of the revolutionary cabinet and Fidel Castro; he still did not occupy a position in the new government at the first major news conference held in Havana.  Fidel is seen standing at the microphones, speaking.  There are two prints of homemade busts of Fidel Castro with lottery tickets that were sold on the street by a vendor.  The verso of this photographs reads:  "'22) Cuba's Castro Craze produces these plaster of Paris busts which are sold by vendors along with national lottery tickets throughout Cuba.  July 6th, the 8th anniversary of his civil war, is being celebrated by the presence of the Communist cosmonaut Major Yuri Gagarin.  Credit: Andrew St. George ©1961 Magnum Photos."</p>

                        <p>This folder includes images of "Operation Truth," a campaign on the part of the revolutionary government to show American critics that the Cuban people supported the trial and execution of all intelligence and security forces of the Batista dictatorship that was responsible for committing atrocities against its opponents.  A highlight of the campaign was the trial of Captain Jesús Sosa Blanco, commander of the military garrison in Holguín, Oriente Province, and one of the most despised batistiano officials on the island in Havana's National Stadium; the trial occurred on January 14, 1959, before 18,000 spectators and members of the international press corps. There are images in the folder showing a million-plus rally in support of revolutionary justice held before the Presidential Palace.  There is a portrait of Elena Escardo, under arrest in Santiago de Cuba.  The verso of this portrait describes her as a "Mexican actress, torrid romantic interest of Masferrer in the late Fifties; here shown under arrest in Santiago after Masferrer fled and Castro took over. She was shot as a suspected spy."  There is another photograph showing two rebels standing before a large mound of earth.  The caption reads:  "WIDE WORLD PHOTOS. MASS GRAVE OF EXECUTED. SANTIAGO, CUBA.... This mound of earth covers the mass grave of 71 Batista followers reported executed yesterday by Cuban rebels. Rebel officers say four of those executed were found guilty of crimes at a Sunday night military tribunal.  Rebel Capt. Frank Fiorino, (left) an American from Norfolk, Va., is one of the two men standing by the grave. January 13, 1959."</p>

                        <p>These images were taken in January and February 1960 when Andrew St. George visited Cuba to write a story on the waning tourist industry.  He also attended Havana's famous carnival that is documented in these photographs.  The caption on one photograph reads:  "Our best Masferrer picture, shot in 1958, when Masferrer was part owner of the casino in Havana's Hotel Riviera, shown here."  A later caption on the same photograph reads:  "This is old picture but historically interesting.  Caption should make clear that Habana Libre Casino was closed by Castro some years ago."</p>

                        <p>Fidel Castro and U.S. Ambassador Philip W. Bonsal had their first face-to-face meeting on March 6, 1959, at Castro's villa in Cojímar. These photographs document that event.  In one image an unidentified rebel officer is standing between Bonsal and Castro.  Included are a number of pictures of Bonsal conversing with the Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations, Roberto Agramonte, possibly before Fidel arrived.  There are photographs of others shown waiting and mingling in the same location.</p>

                        <p>The photographs document U.S. Ambassador Philip W. Bonsal addressing a convention of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) delegates in Habana's Blanquita Theatre on October 21, 1959.  The convention was sponsored entirely by the revolutionary government that hoped to ignite Americans' interest in traveling to Cuba.  The revolutionary government also wanted to thwart U.S. press and governmental caricatured depictions of the Revolution as "Communist," a charge consistently levied since January 1959 in an effort to discredit all changes in Cuba that would negatively impact U.S. business interests.</p>

                        <p>These photographs are of the Revolutionary Tribunal trial of Austin Frank Young and Peter John Lambton.  Young and Lambton were two former World War II American fighter pilots who organized a counterrevolutionary guerrilla force, apparently under the cover of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), for the purpose of toppling the Castro-led government in September 1959.  Their organization's name was The Cuban Democratic Legión.  It counted on the support of such former Batista military officers in the Pinar del Río region as Juan Cruz Padrón and his brothers.  Local peasants in the region were responsible for reporting these subversive activities to regional authorities, who promptly arrested Young, Lambton, and eight guerrilla recruits.  At the trial, Young and Lambton were found guilty of conspiring under the cover of the CIA to topple the Cuban revolutionary government and sentenced to thirty years in prison.  They were later released into United States custody following negotiations over the failed CIA-directed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Other Cuban conspirators received sentences of between 3 and 25 years.</p>

                        <p>These photographs document the presence of Chinese advisors, official journalists, and young volunteers in Cuba by December 1960.  One photograph, taken in the Barrio Chino of Centro Habana, shows a small shop typical of that area of the city, selling canned food, dried fish, soap, packaged herbs, and other dry goods.  The shop is attended by a middle-aged Chinese Cuban and patronized, in this picture, by a member of the Chinese delegation visiting Havana.  Another photograph shows a slim Chinese Cuban in a business suit standing before a taxi and the recently opened Chinese government's solidarity center, still located in the same place, near Calle Zanja in Centro Habana.  Four photographs show business-suited members of the Chinese delegation standing in front of a columned building in Havana, probably near El Prado or on El Prado.  Another photograph shows Chinese visitors dressed as milicianos in white shirts, with several wearing hats, as they wave to a crowd at the main entrance to the Presidential Palace. The Chinese are leaving the Palace, ostensibly after meeting with President Osvaldo Dorticós and others.
  
Two photographs include captions on the back.  One shows a Chinese woman standing with Cuban laborers and a member of the Cuban armed forces.  Its caption reads: "EXCLUSIVE PHOTO FROM EUROPEAN Der. CUBA, TODAY:   Living proof that Chinese Communists are firmly entrenched in Cuba, is shown here.  These Red Chinese volunteers have been sent by that country to work side by side with Cubans, in the Oriente Province of the Sierra Maestra Mountains, in the construction of houses, schools, etc.  Our photographer managed to take this exclusive picture under threat of arrest. [dated] 91660" Stamped December 25, 1960.  Also marked "Foto No 3" and "Cuba Comunismo."  The second captioned photograph shows photographers from the international and domestic press standing on the Malecón in the presence of armed members of the National Revolutionary Police.  A parade is clearly taking place and Cubans are lining the street as a car in the parade drives by.  The caption on the back reads: "(17) RED CHINESE NEWSMEN, like this Sinjua agency photographer shown covering a political rally in Havana, now fan out from Cuba to every Latin country in the hemisphere."</p>

                        <p>These prints were largely made from photographs taken during St. George's last visit to Cuba before the fall of Batista for an article or series of articles he expected to title "Behind Rebel Lines."  The fall of Batista clearly changed that.  The photographs show:  a rebel officer taking an inventory of requisitioned goods in a company store; an elderly man sifting corn; rebels and locals socializing at a bar or cantina in a rural town; a group of rebel soldiers standing in conversation (the tallest among them, smoking a cigar, is a veteran of the Spanish Civil War shown in other photographs as he makes bombs in a rebel bomb shop); a rebel with a gun at a lookout post near the national shrine to the Virgin of Charity, known in Cuba as la Virgen del Cobre, in Cobre, Oriente; a large number of armed rebels marching through a small rural town; same group of rebels as they come over a hillside; young man adjusting a shortwave radio with two men wearing 26th of July beréts next to him; rebel loading an anti-aircraft gun on tripod loaded with a small homemade missile-shaped projectile; rebels working on a requisitioned jeep; blond officer Manuel Boronat overseeing the drying of coffee beans in the sun; composite and retouched print showing unknown rebel, Che Guevara, Universo Sánchez, Raúl and Fidel Castro, Crescencio Pérez and St. George (an uncropped version of this photograph is in box 7, folder 2); nocturnal image of a rebel walking away from what looks like a small building that has been set ablaze (St. George describes this building as a munitions dump in his 1970 oral presentation at Yale narrating filmed out-takes that include this scene).
 
Additional photographs show a dark-toned peasant wearing a hat, sitting or standing before a map of the province with a draped flag and portrait of Castro; rebels in a requisitioned car looking out the window on the driver's side; bearded, shirtless rebel wearing gold Catholic medal as he stands inside an open-air kitchen with another rebel looking on; man exhaling smoke, possibly as part of a typical cleansing ritual; seven hammocks hanging from the ceiling of a thatched-roof building (one clearly occupied); rebel with rifle fleeing from an unidentified construction that has been set ablaze; several men, probably from the 26th of July urban underground, standing on the rocky shore in the company of rebel soldiers as all eleven presumably awaiting transportation to another part of the island (several look out into the distance using binoculars with some bearded men carrying guns); rebel scout or messenger leading a donkey on the hillside; 18 rebels, many with guns aimed in the direction of the camera, posing atop a large military jeep that  probably belonged to Raúl Castro's column.</p>

                        <p>These prints include scenes from Enma Castro's wedding in April 1959.   One print shows Fidel Castro standing near the bride and groom inside the church as he is checking his watch.  In this photo, President Osvaldo Dorticós stands to Castro's immediate left; on Castro's right are Raúl Castro and Vilma Espín (wearing lace veil over her head in the Catholic style).  Two additional photos of the wedding ceremony include important members of the Castro family:  in one, Enma and her Mexican bridegroom kneel before the altar as Ramón Castro, the eldest of the 3 Castro brothers, looks on.  In a second picture, as Enma and the bridegroom prepare to take their vows, her future mother-in-law and her mother, Lina Ruz González, stand to Enma's immediate left.  This folder includes an interesting shot of the mammoth crowd, mostly composed of women, outside the Cathedral of Havana as they press on the limousine with the recently married couple inside (not visible).</p>

                        <p>These photographs document the militarization of Cuba in response to counter-revolutionary violence in 1959, and as a result of continuing counter-revolutionary attacks in 1960, the Revolution's own increasing reliance on authoritarian tactics to intimidate and repress critics.  Three of these photographs had captions originally glued to the verso side of the prints.  The caption to one photograph (stamped 3-30-1960), shot at the gates of Camp Columbia (renamed Camp Libertad after the fall of Batista), reads:  "II: MILITARY FEVER GRIPS CUBA.  With the military extending their jurisdiction over all phases of Cuban national life, their rule grows harsher and narrower.  Here a group of Cuban newsmen are awaiting in front of main gate to Camp Libertad—the principal military post of the Cuban army—to cover a trial of some alleged counterrevolutionaries, conducted by military judges before a closed court martial. Newsmen waited all day, but trial remains closed."  The second print, stamped 10-29-1959 for Life Magazine, includes this caption on the back: "Habana, Oct 26, 1959:  Violence in Cuba:  Harness cops and plain clothesmen swarm around hole in glass pane of front door to editorial offices of Revolución, Fidel Castro's own Habana newspaper; minutes earlier, unidentified terrorists had tossed a handgrenade [sic] through hole, which wounded three people."  A third print shows men undressing with their backs to the camera.  It is captioned as follows:   "With all Cubans of both sexes between ages of 6 and 60 eligible for milicia duty and with new anti-Castro guerrilla forces fighting in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra (in background) all Cuba is getting into uniform, like these shivering and reluctant milicianos of the Havana Architects and Lawyers Militia Battalion; they are called to duty to defend the government against anti-Castro 'bandits' and against a 'foreign invasion.'  This photo was taken in brand-new militia camp at Las Mercedes, among Sierra Maestra foothills."  A copy of this photograph is in Box 43, folder 14.  Lillian Guerra noted  "there were never any anti-Castro guerrilla operating in the Sierra Maestra, during 1960 when this picture was taken or after.  Rather, the movement was located in El Escambray and between 1960 and 1965, the government labeled its members "bandits" in order to discredit them." 
 
Other prints show a prisoner being led away by two members of Cuban intelligence, most probably at the former Marista School in Havana that became an interrogation and holding center for political prisoners in 1960; a wrecked eighteen-wheel truck loaded with eggs that ran off the road (probably by act of counter-revolutionary sabotage), January 1960; military vehicles covered in tarps as seen through the window of a car (image stamped 1961);  a downed plane on the national highway surrounded by a curious crowd and militia men (undated but likely 1960); two shots of snipers posted at the top of the control tower of Havana's international airport (winter 1960);  troops riding atop tanks during a military parade (probably May 1, 1960, at the Plaza of the Revolution); three members of the army, two of whom sit on a couch (one reading a comic, the other a political education manual issued to the army); and finally, a scene of a woman near two parked cars, one of which shows a sign that reads (in Spanish): "The planes left from the United States."  This sign references the aerial fly-bys and leafletting campaign that the former head of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force, Pedro Díaz Lanz, carried out in October 1959 around the same time as the Huber Matos affair and attending national crisis over the disappearance (and presumed assassination) of Camilo Cienfuegos.</p>

One photograph shows a boy speaking into a microphone from a speaker's dais as a white robed priest stands next to it. The boy is wearing a small badge that reads (in Spanish) "Day of the Catholic Student" on his lapel.  The second photograph shows a group of priests and seminarians standing with three students on the outskirts of the crowd, just in front and to the side of the statue of Martí.</p>

                        <p>These photographs document Fidel Castro's January 23, 1959 trip to Caracas, Venezuela, which celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the former Venezuelan dictator exactly one year to the day earlier, and the establishment of the democratic government of Romulo Betancourt with whom Castro met.  Five photographs in this group show Fidel sitting next to Betancourt at a luncheon table with various members of Fidel's personal body guard unit immediately behind.  Betancourt is the portly, balding man in the tie sitting next to him.</p>

                        <p>This folder contains eight pictures from Fidel's September 1960 trip to New York City to speak at the United Nations.  Included are seven photographs taken during his stay at Harlem's Hotel Theresa and one of a demonstration against Castro where protesters stood behind a barricade holding a large poster image of image of Camilo Cienfuegos  and signs comparing Fidel to Hitler.  In the foreground, next to a shouting demonstrator wearing a hand-painted T-shirt reading 'Cuba SI' (in English, Cuba Yes) is Luis Conte Agüero.  Conte Agüero had been Castro's close friend and informal public relations manager during his imprisonment on the Isle of Pines under Batista from 1953 to 1955.  Conte Agüero left Cuba in 1960; at the time, he was a journalist and television personality.  An identical photograph is in Box 43, folder 3.  There is an additional print from NBC's <title render="italic">

                        <p>All of these photographs were taken when St. George visited Cuba during Carnival season for a story on the collapse of foreign tourism to Cuba.  For this story, he accompanied Marvin and Phyllis Miroff, a honeymooning American couple, whom he photographed as they ate in El Floridita, an abandoned restaurant at the entrance to Obispo Street, near Havana's Central Park.  Two prints show members of a comparsa dancing on El Prado, a street in front of the Capitol Building in Centro Habana.  Three photographs show women dressed in costume and parading or dancing as they perform in different nightclub settings.  An additional two photographs show a Cuban Chinese dance troupe performing on El Prado, adjacent to the building that housed the soon-to-be-defunct Diario de la Marina, Cuba's oldest and most conservative newspaper.  There are two identical photographic portraits of an unidentified, corpulent Cuban woman wearing sparkly clothing and earrings. There are four photographs of the casino at the Hotel Riviera, one of the last hotels built under Batista.  These hotels were built largely by and for the U.S. mafia, which used them to launder money and run a narco-trafficking operation.  On the back of one these casino images St. George wrote "Havana Riviera casino, of which Masferrer was part owner."  The caption refers to Rolando Masferrer, the head of one of Batista's bloodiest and most notorious death squads, known as Los Tigres, which operated in Holguin, Oriente.  Masferrer was forced to flee the country in November 1959 mostly after bad press coverage on his excesses led the United States to pressure Batista into limiting Masferrer's activities.  Finally, there is one print, also taken during this February 1960 assignment, of three small boys watching the scene inside a bar in Old Havana at night.  These boys are shown in many different shots contained in the Cuban Revolution Collection (MS 650 http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.0650).</p>

                        <p>These photos depict pro-government demonstrations protesting counter-revolutionary violence by Cuban exiles based in the United States.  As is clear from the garlands on lamp posts saying "Welcome ASTA" [American Society of Travel Agents] in English, these photographs were taken in October 1959 when Cuba hosted America's largest association of travel agents.  One photo, showing female protestors in the foreground and a truck filled with militia members, was taken near the street known as La Rampa in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana.  Another shows demonstrators staging a road block along Havana's sea wall, known as El Malecón.  Two additional photographs show a group of demonstrators and a group of men running down Reina Street, near the corner with Carlos III.</p>

Ramón is shown in a seated, formal portrait shot.  The photograph with a man wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a military uniform is Raúl Chibás, a founding member of the Orthodox Party to which Fidel had once been a member.  Although the location and activity are unclear, Fidel can be seen talking to uniformed members of the crew over Chibás's right shoulder, in the rear.  Two additional photographs show the famous blond and blue-eyed William Morgan, an American who joined the Segundo Frente del Escambray and fought Batista in early 1958.</p>

                        <p>These photographs are of Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba Enrique Pérez Serantes attending a mass rally.  He is surrounded by people in uniform who appear to be armed members of the revolutionary militia.  Pérez Serantes was most famous for having intervened in 1953 to save Fidel and Raúl Castro's lives when Batista ordered the capture and execution of all members of the commando team who attacked the Moncada Military Barracks on the 26th of July.</p>

                        <p>These prints depict scenes from different mass rallies in support of the government held between January 1959 and July 1960.  In one image, a woman who fainted from the heat of the crowd is treated by members of the Red Cross.  This photograph probably dates from January 1959 with the rally in support of executing war criminals held before the Presidential Palace.  Two nocturnal images show large crowd scenes.   The context for one of these images can be discerned:  protestors holding signs denouncing Spain's Ambassador to Cuba after a famous incident occurred on live television when Fidel accused Spain of aiding and abetting counter-revolutionaries.  Spanish Ambassador Vellizca himself appeared and insulted Fidel before the cameras and denied any involvement.  A large sign reads:  "Vellizca, Para España o Para la Cabaña" ("Vellizca, go back to Spain or suffer the pain").  La Cabaña was the military fortress that held supporters of the Batista regime before trial and execution.  Another photograph depicts Fidel in close view giving a speech at a rally, while a second photograph shows him from behind addressing a massive crowd near the Sierra Maestra on July 26, 1959.   Fidel is also seen surrounded by members of the revolutionary government as he speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace.  Immediately under Fidel's raised right arm is Efigenio Almeijras, chief of the national police, and  along the front, President Osvaldo Dorticós is seen clapping with a small boy and Camilo Cienfuegos at this side.  The final picture shows Fidel and others as they observe a military parade, most likely on May 1, 1960, from the base of the Monumento de José Martí in Havana's Plaza de la Revolución.  In the top row, left to right, the following are identified:  bearded man with dark glasses, Faustino Pérez;  moustached man seated next to him, holding hat, Efigenio Almeijras; Osvlado Doricós, standing; Fidel Castro; further to the right are William Morgan (edge of image, blonde); Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo (seated with dark glasses and very thin frame); behind both of them appears to be a laughing Jacobo Arbenz, former elected president of Guatemala who was toppled by a CIA-staged coup for supporting land reform in 1954.</p>

                        <p>These two photographs are of Fidel Castro and Sukarno, President of Indonesia, during the latter's March 1960 trip to Cuba.  One print shows Sukarno and Fidel with others at a pig farm; a bearded Antonio Nuñez Jiménez stands next to Sukarno. The other photograph shows Sukarno holding the hands of a young girl and smiling while his luncheon companions, including Fidel Castro, smoking a cigar, and a crowd look on.</p>

                        <p>There is a close up image of Carlos Prío de Socarrás, former President of Cuba who was deposed by Batista's March 1952 coup.  Prío provided money for Fidel to mount his expedition to Cuba in 1956 from Mexico aboard the yacht Granma.   Prío later returned twice in 1959 and 1960 to show his support for the regime.  He later broke with the Revolution and committed suicide in Miami in 1973. A second picture depicts Carlos Franqui (with moustache), editor of Revolución, the organ of the 26th of July Movement as of January 1959 that later became the government's official newspaper, with unknown man at his side.  A third photograph depicts Vilma Espín as she is giving a speech at a conference in Mexico City.  The photograph includes a caption by St. George on the verso:  "STANDING APPLAUSE FROM ELITE LEADERS OF LATIN AMERICAN LEFT interrupts speech by Vilma Espín at Inter-American Anti-Imperialist Congress, a Communist-front rally she had helped organize in Mexico City. Standing at table, l—r, are Olga Poblete of Chile, Stalin-prize winner, author and top Chilean feminist leader; the Soviet Chief Delegate, Ambassador Vladimir M. Krimenko; Former President Lázaro Cárdenas of Mexico; General Felipe Yara, a famous revolutionary leader."</p>

                        <p>These photographs relate to St. George's post-1961 support for CIA-backed counter-revolutionary activities in Cuba.  Several have annotations in pencil on the back, identifying the person pictured.  Two duplicate images show Max Azicri Levy, identified as "CIA-Man", with a puzzle of Che Guevara's face and recent publications about Cuba in a Montevideo hotel.  Another image shows Manuel Urrutia pictured in exile in 1963; he was the first president of Cuba under the Revolution and then forced to resign by Castro in July 1959.  A color snapshot print shows two men talking in front of an aircraft: the verso reads "Frank Fiorini on Rt".  The photograph of passengers descending a staircase from a plane upon arrival includes the caption:  "ENTERING LATIN AMERICA from Cuba, this photograph shows three Chinese labor union organizers arriving at Carrasco Airport, Montevideo, (Uruguay) in the evening of 14 May 1961, aboard a special flight of the Cuban Britannia turboprop CUT 671, known among Us newsmen in Latin America for its many special flights and political passengers as 'Castro's Redball Express.' Head of this Chinese team of 'political workers' is Kuo Mao An, secretary general of the Electrical Trades Union Federation of the Chinese People's Republic (at door of plane, in broad-brimmed hat)."  Two other pictures show unidentified men, both of them Cuban in single portrait close-ups. A final picture includes two American men, with the sitting man adjusting the lens to a sniper rifle with a silencer.  He aims from his place at a table that includes practice target boards and another attachable rifle.</p>

                        <p>The peasants represented in these photographs are engaged in everyday activities such as winnowing corn, standing in line at a local dry goods store, and horseback riding.  These peasants probably lived near the 26th of July columns commanded by Fidel and Raúl Castro.  One image shows a typical hamlet of peasant homes in the plains region of Oriente, probably near Raúl Castro's column outside the highlands in a newly liberated zone when St. George visited his camp.  Images date from Fall 1958.</p>

                        <p>These photographs were taken during Fidel Castro's two-week tour of the northeast United States on invitation of the National Press Club.  One photograph shows him sitting in a New York City hotel surrounded by 5 women. The notation by St. George on the back reads: "This unusual photo shows Fidel Castro with five women who played a significant romantic role in his life.  From left to right: Conchita Fernández (no hat) in whose house he lived and who was his lady friend in Habana while Castro was finishing law school and beginning his political career; Tete Casuso (bangs, off-the-shoulder dress) in whose house he lived in romantic union during his year of exile in Mexico City in 1956; Isabela Montero, a fashionable Havana divorcee who was frequently seen with Castro in 1960; Celia Sánchez, with whom he lived and who served as his principal courier during the two years of jungle guerrilla warfare (1957-1958); and Nora Serrano, a Havana journalist, who often stayed overnight with Castro in the Habana Hilton in 1961-62 (wide-brimmed white hat)."  The photograph of Castro responding to reporters questions with his translator Tete Casuso at his side includes this caption:  "Seated next to Castro (right) is Tete Casuso, who was his paramour and in whose house Castro lived during his year of exile in Mexico.  After rebel victory in Habana, Mme. Casuso was rewarded with post of Castro's personal Pressechef and she traveled everywhere with Fidel.  But fierce jealousies and deadly intrigues among ladies of what Mme. Casuso used to call 'Fidel's harem' – Celia Sanchez, Conchita Fernandez, other, younger women – drove Mme. Casuso into exile in the mid-Sixties.  She now lives in France."  Additional photographs show Fidel after placing a floral wreath at the foot of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC; giving a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors at the Statler Hilton in New York with Tete Casuso gazing at Castro; making a televised appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" on April 19, 1959, with the show's moderator Ned Brooks and interpreter Anthony Hervas (an identical photograph is in Box 8, folder 7); and giving an interview to an unidentified reporter.</p>

                        <p>These photographs document Fidel Castro and his delegation's September 1960 visit to New York City to attend a meeting at the United Nations where Fidel gave his famous speech announcing the upcoming Literacy Campaign of 1961.  The Cuban delegates ultimately stayed at the Hotel Theresa in Harlem after a dispute with a Manhattan hotel.  One photograph shows African American supporters demonstrating in Harlem and fighting off police; hand-held signs read "US Jim Crows Fidel Just Like US Jim Crows Us Negroes!" and "Fidel is Welcome in Harlem Anytime!".  Additional images show the police escort standing before the entrance to the Hotel Theresa; Fidel and Juan Almeida enjoying a dinner with the hotel staff before a mob of reporters at the hotel; Almeida talking to two waitresses at a nearby coffee shop; Almeida and other Cuban delegates, including Antonio Nuñez Jiménez, standing at the counter of the same coffee shop, apparently listening to someone or watching a televised broadcast; crowds of supporters standing before the windows of the hotel; members of the delegation looking down at them; and of a demonstration against Castro where protesters stood behind a barricade holding a large poster image of image of Camilo Cienfuegos  and signs comparing Fidel to Hitler.  In the foreground, next to a shouting demonstrator wearing a hand-painted T-shirt reading 'Cuba SI' (in English, Cuba Yes) is Luis Conte Agüero.  Conte Agüero had been Castro's close friend and informal public relations manager during his imprisonment on the Isle of Pines under Batista from 1953 to 1955.  Conte Agüero left Cuba in 1960; at the time, he was a journalist and television personality.  An identical photograph is in Box 8, folder 7.</p>

                        <p>These images document the visit of Vice Premier Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba in February 1960.  Ostensibly, Mikoyan was there to inaugurate the traveling exhibit of Soviet culture and products that would be held at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Havana.  Also included are photographs of a student protest held in Central Park shortly after Mikoyan deposited an imperial-looking floral wreath with Soviet bloc symbols at the foot of the monument to Cuban nationalist leader José Martí.  Other images show the lavish state reception Prime Minister Fidel Castro and President Osvaldo Dorticós held at the Presidential Palace to honor Mikoyan on the day of his arrival; Mikoyan at the airport; and members of the Soviet security detail as they kept watch during the reception at the Presidential Palace.  One of the photographs is from an issue of <title render="italic">

                        <p>These images show young Cuban men participating in roadblocks, probably as part of a public strike in support of the Cuban government in October 1959.  Two prints are of roadblocks on the Malecón, the sea wall that borders Havana's northern shore, and one is of a road block on Calle Línea, Vedado.</p>

Fanatic commitment to guerrilla warfare and constant hostility to US united Che and Chinese leaders:  Che believes (and has led Fidel Castro to believe for a while) that if national frontiers are disregarded, Latin America is very much like pre-revolutionary China, huge, starving, agrarian, vulnerable to the same peasant guerrilla strategy which brought Communists victory in China."</p>

                        <p>These images are of young school boys during morning assembly at the newly constructed school at the former Moncada military barracks in Oriente.  It was at this barracks that Fidel's ill-prepared armed force attacked on the 26th of July 1953, resulting in a massacre of most of its members.  Fidel's subsequent guerrilla movement took the 26th of July as its name in honor of the dead and wounded from that famous attack.  Although Fidel claimed that he would convert military barracks into schools, that conversion ironically entailed the creation of highly militarized schools such as this one.  These photographs show the boys carrying their metal trays for breakfast and assembling to march, military-style, into the dining area.  At this time, many of these boys would likely have come from poor, marginal families near the Sierra Maestra. This explains their disheveled appearance and the fact that at least one of them (a black boy) is not wearing shoes. One photograph is captioned:  "II. MILITARY FEVER GRIPS CUBA.  Barracks-type drill discipline is applied to all but the youngest children in Castro's Cuba.  Here peasant boys recruited from the Sierra Maestra region are shown in front of a school center, partly completed (right) but largely still under construction (left and right rear.)  This school center, a surprisingly large and modern construction project among the roadless Sierra Maestra foothills (the nearest settlement is tiny El Cerro, and the nearest town of any size, Manzanillo, is a hundred miles away) will eventually house 20,000 farm children.  The boys shown here, part of the first contingent of 500 already living and studying at the school center, spend their day under supervision of Cuban rebel army drill instructors, and - under Communist Chinese pattern the Cuban Army appears to be imposing on rural education - only half their day is spent in school; half is spent in work out among the canebrakes."</p>

The photographs show snipers posted on the roof of Havana's airport; a wrecked train and a burned-out bus that appear to have been the products of counter-revolutionary assaults; a plane of the type manned by exile counter-revolutionary forces in their regular invasions of Cuban airspace (this one appears to have either crash landed or been shot down by Cuban defenses); and images of a police check point on the western outskirts of Havana near the San Alejandro Art Academy.</p>

                        <p>Dating from the early months of 1960, these photographs were taken when St. George accompanied Fidel Castro and Antonio Nuñez Jiménez, both directors of Instituto Nacional de Reforma Agraria (INRA), as they made an inspection tour of recently nationalized farms and plantations in the interior of the country.  The images include a shot of several university-age students outfitted in militia uniforms as they await the arrival of a bus that will probably take them to a political education camp in the mountains.  The students wear new boots and are carrying weapons as well as personal items, including multiple packs of cigarettes in the case of the boy and a fashionable fur hat in the case of one of the girls.  Another image shows Fidel and his aide René Vallejo surrounded by peasants in a small town.  Additional images show Fidel walking along a road at a state farm with others; Fidel addressing a group of peasants at the state farm's social club for workers (volleyball net in foreground, Fidel's head barely visible above the crowd); a young peasant with a rifle doing guard duty before the INRA Tienda del Pueblo; INRA officials in a corn field; Vallejo talking with officials at the foot of a ceiba tree; an unidentified construction site; peasants lounging on a tractor as the sun sets in the background; peasant driving an ox cart; Vallejo reviewing correspondence in a hotel room; and peasants on a cart in front of the Tienda del Pueblo.</p>

                        <p>The radicalization process of 1960 and the participation of the population in various state programs of political indoctrination and economic management were modeled on the Soviet and Chinese Communist system.  These photographs include a shot of a political education class in which all participants wear the uniform of the Revolutionary Militia; a rally before the Presidential Palace, shot from the balcony or its roof; young girls marching military-style under the supervision of drill instructors on San Lázaro Street, a main artery that connects the University of Havana with Centro Habana; Fidel and other officials gathered at the monument to José Martí in Revolutionary Plaza, minutes before a major rally; hand-made signs posted on the storefront of Western Union on Havana's Obispo Street, protesting the closure of the office and the firing of Cuban employees; a wide-angle street scene taken on Carlos III, a wide avenue in Havana, showing the nationalist political postings on the median and wall of a building (these claim revolutionary goals as "National Sovereignty, Economic Independence, Agrarian Reform, Industrialization"); a newsstand featuring only government-controlled media and magazines from socialist countries; a government print shop with political propaganda books published recently; men suiting up for militia duty (duplicate print is in Box 8, folder 4); and a wall with graffiti supporting Fidel.  The image of the girls marching includes a strip caption on back by St. George that reads "In typical tableau, group of 6-8 year old schoolgirls [sic] drill under 2 rebel army instructors on Havana's central San Lazaro St."  The photograph with Fidel and other leaders assembled on the speaker's platform at the monument to Martí includes notes on the back that correspond to numbers St. George penciled in, pinpointing certain figures standing with Fidel.  They are American William Morgan (later shot for treason in 1961), Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo (later founder of the exile guerrilla Alpha 66) and Aubelz (?).  St George seems to be indicating who were members of the Segundo Frente Escambray, an independent guerrilla organization that allied with Fidel's movement to topple Batista.  After 1960, the Segundo Frente's members became suspect because they were all avowedly anti-Communist and therefore believed to be tied to the CIA.  The photograph of the men suiting up for military duty includes this caption:  II:  MILITARY FEVER GRIPS CUBA / With all Cubans (of both sexes) between the ages of 6 and 60 eligible for milicia duty, and with new anti-Castro guerrilla forces fighting in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra (mountains in the background) all Cuba is getting into uniform, like these shivering and reluctant milicianos of the Havana Architects' and Lawyers Militia Battalion:  they are called to duty to defend the government against anti-Castro "bandits" (who have entered violent battle against the Castro regime during first weeks of April) and against a "foreign invasion" which has not yet materialized, but which Castro seems to expect.  This photo was taken in brand-new – as yet unfinished – militia camp at Las Mercedes, among Sierra Maestra foothills.</p>

                        <p>These identical prints of a Cuban named Luis Uceda de la Fuente, giving a speech at a street rally in Lima, Peru, 1964.  One of the images contains a caption:  Che's close friend and ally Luis Uceda de la Fuente harangues Lima street crowd under typical poster showing US as rat spitted by Cuban machete.  Luis Uceda was sent to the Andes mountains last year by Che to take charge of guerrilla offensive:  he was killed by US-trained Peruvian antiguerrilla [sic] troops in December, 1965."

                        <p>The Anti-Imperialist Congress held in Mexico City in 1960 was sponsored by the international Communist movement's Latin American section.  This event was attended by Vilma Espín along with many of the region's leading Communist intellectuals.  One caption noted that "'ALL THIS TALK BORES ME' Vilma told a friend during Mexican Anti-Imperialist Congress she'd helped [sic] organize, and this picture bears her out.  Vilma, a pragmatist, saw big Congress mainly as opportunity for behind-the-scenes maneuvering, at which she proved brilliantly successful.  At microphone:  the chief Brazilian delegate, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Part of Brazil, Joao da Silva."</p>

Fidel Castro is surrounded by soldiers and crowd next to a fire truck, apparently taken at the time of his January 1959 trip to Venezuela. Castro also appears at a reception at the Presidential Palace in the early days of 1959 and on the Cuban television show Ante la Prensa.  President Osvaldo Dorticós and Prime Minister Fidel Castro are seated next to each other  apparently as part of a panel or public discussion, location and date unknown.  Vilma Espín (in the dark dress) is shown at a televised broadcast with a panel of women who included Loló de la Torriente Brau (on Espin's right), a longtime femenina and journalist active since the 1920s and E. Lina Milanés (See also Cuban Revolution Collection, MS 650, http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.0650, see Book VIII Print 66).  Former first president of revolutionary Cuba, Manuel Urrutia, is seen examining a 1963 photograph that St. George had apparently shown him.  Urrutia was in exile at the time, after having been ousted from the government when Fidel denounced him fraudulently as morally corrupt and unreliable in a televised broadcast in July of 1959.</p>

                        <p>These photographs are of unidentified Cubans and Americans in diverse settings.  One image at Havana's race track was probably part of St. George's story on the American honeymooners Marvin and Phyllis Minoff who traveled to Cuba in early 1960.  Here one can see various gamblers looking at a mounted board with the list of horses to bet on.  (For an extensive set of photographs of this race track, see the Cuban Revolution Collection, MS 650, http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.0650 and search using the names of the honeymooners.)
