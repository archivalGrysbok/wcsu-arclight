         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Eric Alfred Havelock was born in London, England, on June 3, 1903, the son of Alfred H. and Annie Louise (Williams) Havelock. As a young boy, he lived in Scotland, attending Greenock Academy where he was introduced to Greek at age twelve. From 1917 to 1926, he was at Cambridge, first at Leys, an English public school, where he studied under W. H. Balgarnie, a classics professor after whom James Hilton's <title render="italic">
               Mr. Chips
            </title> was created. In 1922 Havelock won a scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, and graduated in 1926 with distinctions in the classical tripos and ancient philosophy.</p>
         <p>Migrating to Canada, Havelock served as assistant and associate professor at Acadia University in Nova Scotia from 1926 to 1929 and was an associate professor at Victoria College at the University of Toronto from 1929 to 1947. In addition to his academic responsibilities, he pursued outside political interests. A former member of the British Labour Party, Havelock continued his participation in the liberal cause and was active in local politics. He was a founding member of the League for Social Reconstruction in 1930 and was elected to the provincial council and executive committee of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) which merged with the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961, emerging as the New Democratic Party. In 1945, he ran unsuccessfully as a CCF candidate for the constituency of South Wellington to the Ontario legislature. He was also the associate editor of the <title render="italic">
               Canadian Forum
            </title>. On the academic front, he was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1941 and 1943 and co-founded the Ontario Classical Association, parent organization of the Canadian Classical Association, in 1944, serving as its first president and associate editor of its publication, <title render="italic">
               The Phoenix
            </title>.</p>
         <p>In 1947, Havelock moved to Cambridge, Massachussetts, to assume academic posts at Harvard University: senior tutor in Leverett House (1947-1950), associate and full professor of Greek and Latin (1947-1963), chairman of the Classics Department (1956-1961), and acting chairman in 1962. He was a member of the Harvard Committee on Admissions and Scholarships (1948- 1963), and a member of the Board of Trustees of Radcliffe College (1959-1963). During this time, he assisted in the drafting of the recommendation that female students receive a joint degree with Harvard. He also participated in the formation of the proposal establishing the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. and was a senior fellow on the governing board (1965-1973).</p>
         <p>Visiting professorships at Princeton University (1961-1963) preceded Havelock's appointment as Sterling Professor of Classics at Yale University (1963-1971) and chairman of the Classics Department (1963-1969). Upon his retirement from Yale in 1971, Havelock was the Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the State University of New York, Buffalo (1971-1973).</p>
         <p>Havelock lectured at numerous North American and European academic institutions and was the author of numerous scholarly articles and books: <title render="italic">
               The Lyric Genius of Catullus
            </title> (1939), <title render="italic">

            </title> (1987), <title render="italic">

            </title> (Vanier Lecture),  <title render="italic">
               Prologue to Greek Literacy
            </title> (Semple Lecture), and <title render="italic">

            </title>. He was co-editor with Yale English professor Maynard Mack for the Prentice-Hall <title render="italic">

            </title> (1978).</p>
         <p>Havelock married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, and had a daughter, Joan Ellen (Mrs. Richard Wheeler-Bennett), two sons, John Eric and Ronald Geoffrey, and ten grandchildren. In 1962, he married Christine Mitchell, professor of art at Vassar College and author of <title render="italic">
               Hellinistic Art
            </title>. Havelock died at his home in Poughkeepsie, New York, on April 4, 1988, after a short illness.</p>

               <p>The Correspondence files are arranged in three sections: chronological, with the bulk of letters from the mid 1930s through the early 1970s; alphabetical, with emphasis on the late 1960s until Havelock's death in 1988, with some overlap between the two sections; and publishers. The letters often mix personal and professional communication, demonstrating Havelock's gift for maintaining relationships over the years, and in some cases, for decades, with students, colleagues, and associates. His correspondence, while concentrated in this series, may be found in lesser degrees throughout the remaining series.</p>
               <p>The Publishers files of correspondence are arranged alphabetically by name of publisher, publication, or literary agent and document Havelock's role as a contributor and/or editorial advisor. Although the magnitude of these files attests to Havelock's prolific authorship, the files themselves contain rather routine correspondence and accompanying materials, such as contracts; receipts and royalty statements; corrections; proofs; publicity materials; questions of copyright; and permissions to publish. Reviews of his works are included at the end of the Publishers files.</p>

               <p>The Professional files are arranged in three sections: appointments, conferences, and organizations. Appointments pertain to Havelock's academic appointments at Harvard University as lecturer and professor (1947-1951), chairman of the Classics Department (1955-1960), and acting chairman (1962); member of the Board of Trustees of Radcliffe College (1959-1963); and his appointment to the Andrew Raymond Chair of Classics at the State University of New York in Buffalo (1971-1973). The files are arranged alphabetically by organization and consist of correspondence, reports, meeting minutes, financial records, and printed materials. For teaching materials corresponding to Havelock's years at Harvard, consult Series V, Writings, Research, and Teaching Files. For material pertaining to his appointments at Yale University, consult Series VI, Yale Files.</p>
               <p>Conference files relating to the conferences and lectures attended by Havelock are arranged by the title of the event and contain primarily routine correspondence regarding logistics of the events and publicity rather than the actual lecture or paper presented.</p>
               <p>Materials pertaining to organizations in which Havelock participated complete the series. Of particular note is the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C., established by the Harvard Corporation in 1960. For files on the Ontario Classical Association, of which Havelock was a co-founder and first president, consult Series III, Canadian Files.</p>

               <p>The Canadian files, arranged alphabetically by organization, and by topic within the organization, document Havelock's political views and activities, as well as his contributions to the field of classics, during his years in Canada. Emphasis is on the founding and work of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the League of Social Reconstruction (LSR). The files include correspondence; reports; constituency files; campaign and election materials; publicity; writings; and related printed materials.</p>
               <p>On the academic front, there are files on the Ontario Classical Association, of which Havelock was a co-founder and first president. A minimal amount of writings on education are included at the end of the series.

               <p>The series is arranged in two sections: personal papers and photographs. The bulk of the personal papers section consists of materials amassed by Havelock for his unfinished autobiography, which he began writing in the early 1980s. A chapter draft, entitled "An Edwardian Childhood," completed in 1983, was intended by him "...as an installment leading into some account of my adult life, as lived mainly in North America, but keeping in mind the historical context of two world wars, and reflections stimulated thereby." His files consist primarily of newspaper and journal clippings, as well as correspondence, notes, and memorabilia, often heavily annotated with questions and/or observations. The files have been maintained in their original order and are arranged in a chronological time frame corresponding to time periods in Havelock's life. Thus folders may contain research materials from 1980s sources but refer to an event or person for an earlier time period. Other files are arranged by topic but still adhere to a basic chronological order; some files are unsorted. The remainder of the series includes academic certificates, legal documents, memoriams, and memorabilia of Havelock. Photographs of Havelock and family members complete the series.</p>

               <p>This series, the largest in the papers, is described in the order in which the papers were received. Materials have been left in their original binders and/or folders and the spine/label information constitutes the listing. Most of the materials are in Havelock's handwriting and consist of book drafts; course notes and lectures; and subject files of printed materials. Whenever possible, course materials are identified by course number and include lecture notes, class assignments, exams, and related research materials.</p>

               <p>This series consists of files compiled by Havelock during his time at Yale as chairman of the Classics Department. They are arranged in two sections, correspondence and topical files, and alphabetically within each section. There is overlap between the two sections. The papers contain correspondence of Havelock either with or about individuals, most of whom served in the Classics Department in some capacity; requests for recommendations and copies thereof; requests to participate in seminars/conferences; official records of appointments, leaves of absence, and finances; and letters and memos to university administrators. The materials reflect the challenges of reorganization of the department dealt with by Havelock as chairman.</p>
