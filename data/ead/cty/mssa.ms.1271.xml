         <abstract id="aspace_784b03e81506df620edfb4e9532e043d">Memoirs, correspondence, reports, and printed matter largely reflecting Stanhope Bayne-Jones' service as dean of the Yale School of Medicine, 1935-1940. The most significant part of the papers are his memoirs in the form of a transcript of an oral history interview conducted by Dr. Harlan Phillips for the National Library of Medicine in 1966. In the interviews, Bayne-Jones describes his education, his service in World War I, his research and his career. Included also are papers relating to his portrait which was installed in the library of the School of Medicine in 1959.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This unprocessed collection contains papers pertaining to Stanhope Bayne-Jones. The most interesting portion of the collection consists of Bayne-Jones's memoirs. These are in the form of a five-volume mimeographed copy of typed transcripts of an oral history elicited by Dr. Harlan Phillips from Bayne-Jones for the National Library of Medicine in 1966. In the interviews Bayne-Jones describes his education and service in World War I, his research, colleagues, and his career.</p>
         <p>The collection also contains several items of Bayne-Jones's correspondence about the report of the Dean of the Yale School of Medicine to the President of the University and about the Scientific Research Bill of 1937. In addition, there is a copy of a report about medical research produced for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare by a committee of which Bayne-Jones was the chairman.</p>
         <p>The remaining papers, approximately one third of the collection, consist of correspondence, financial records, notes, and printed matter of the Bayne-Jones Portrait Committee. This Yale School of Medicine group was charged with having a portrait of Bayne-Jones painted for the Historical Medicine Library, and the papers deal with fund-raising and with the official unveiling of the portrait on December 11, 1959.</p>
