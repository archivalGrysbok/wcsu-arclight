               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Part I consists of correspondence, papers, newspaper clippings and journals of four generations of Bacon family members—David Bacon (1771-1817) to Seldon Bacon (1861-1946). It thus provides a wealth of material which is especially pertinent to major social and religious issues of the latter half of the 19th century. The greater part of the correspondence and papers are those of Leonard Bacon (1802-1881), clergyman, educator and writer. The collection contains many of his articles on various religious and political topics. His sermons were printed in many publications and his funeral orations were well known and reprinted by many of his colleagues.  His extensive correspondence with his family, friends, and political leaders is included in the collection.</p>

               <p>Part I is arranged in four series: Series I, Correspondence, contains letters between the entire Bacon family as well as friends and associates, and forms the bulk of the collection. The letters are arranged chronologically, headed by a description of the correspondence from 1817-1881. Series II, the Subject file, contains various legal and business documents and papers of the Bacon family, biographical data, lists of Leonard Bacon's discourses and publications, and other miscellaneous items. Series III, Manuscripts, contains writings of the Bacon family, material pertaining to church organizations, reports and minutes of various clubs and committees, writings of others, and unidentified or anonymous writings. The final section, Series IV, contains printed matter, consisting primarily of newspaper clippings, magazine articles and pamphlets, and news clipping scrapbooks, all relating predominately to religious and social issues, such as church affairs, temperance, and slavery, but also to a wide range of other topics.</p>

                  <p>This series contains the correspondence between four generations of members of the Bacon Family as well as correspondence with friends and associates. A great part of the correspondence is that of the Reverend Leonard Bacon. The first folder in the series is a description of correspondence between the years 1817 and 1881 and the rest of the folders are arranged chronologically. The series ends with a folder for undated correspondence, arranged alphabetically, and a letterbook of L. W. Bacon, 1874-1876 (largely illegible).</p>

                  <p>This series begins with essays, sermons, articles, and other writings of Leonard, Leonard W., and T. R. Bacon, respectively. Following this is a section relating to various church organizations, then a section concerning other clubs, committees, and town meetings. Writings of others ensues, among which the description of the scandal and trial surrounding Leonard Bacon's sister and Alexander McWhorter, written by Catherine Beecher, is notable. After this where is a larger section of unidentified or anonymous works, many of which are probably by members of the Bacon family. The folders are arranged alphabetically by title, subject, or name of the organization, except under writings of others, arranged by author's name. At the end of the series, there are seven folders containing miscellaneous writings, usually very short or fragmentary, covering a wide range of topics, from notes on Akkadian inscriptions to thoughts on ecclesiastical and governmental bodies. Many items concern notes and commentary on Biblical passages. Much of the material in this series is of general historical interest, for example the copied excerpts from the journal of Ezra Stiles, under writings of others.</p>

                  <p>This series consists of newspaper clippings, magazine articles and pamphlets, and newsclipping scrapbooks. There is also one folder containing the "Protest of the Minority" in the McWhorter trial, 1847. Most of the newspaper clippings are taken from The Independent, a religious newspaper, and many deal with the problem of slavery in the United States. The magazine articles and pamphlets are mostly of a religious nature, and cover such topics as local church affairs, temperance societies, and foreign missions. Many of the newspaper articles and pamphlets were written by the Reverend Leonard Bacon. The folders are arranged chronologically by year, with a special folder at the end of each section for undated items. The scrapbooks reflect only a general grouping chronologically and by subject matter.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Part II of the Bacon Family Papers consists of the correspondence, book and sermon manuscripts, newspaper clippings, printed matter, and photos of four generations of the Bacon family, 1819-1933, most notably Leonard Bacon, 1802-1881, Leonard Woolsey Bacon, Sr., 1830-1907, and Leonard Woolsey Bacon, Jr., 1865-1939. The bulk of the collection consists of the manuscript sermons of Leonard Bacon, the historical and theological writings of Leonard Woolsey Bacon, Sr. and Theodore Davenport Bacon, Jr. In addition, there are newspaper clippings and printed articles, lectures, and sermons by several members of the family pertaining to history, religion, congregational polity, and medicine, as well as reform movements, such as, temperance and abolition. Much of the correspondence is personal and pertains to family affairs, but a considerable amount is also devoted to public and professional matters. Of special interest is the Leonard Bacon—Henry Ward Beecher correspondence, 1852-1876, most of which pertains to the Beecher-Tilden controversy. Bacon played a prominent part in this episode serving as moderator for a council of churches called by Beecher's enemies in 1874, and again for a council held in Plymouth Church in 1876. In addition, there is an interesting and important correspondence between Leonard Bacon, a leading champion of temperance, and his brother, David Francis Bacon, who was an alcoholic, that sheds much light on the prevailing attitude toward the problem of alcoholism.</p>

               <p>This addition to the Bacon Family Papers consists primarily of photographs of a trip to Palestine and Europe taken by Benjamin Wisner Bacon, lectures on religion, and administrative documents regarding the Yale University Divinity School. The bulk of the photographs are of landscapes and ruins; a few photographs include unidentified individuals, as well as some photographs of his children, Dorothy Buckingham Bacon and Benjamin Selden Bacon. This material spans from 1900-1920.</p>
