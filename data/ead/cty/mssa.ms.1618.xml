         <p>Alfred Carlton Gilbert was born on February 15, 1884, in Salem, Oregon. He attended Pacific University and graduated from the Yale Medical School in 1909. The same year Gilbert founded the Mysto Manufacturing Company, producer of magic sets. In 1916, he changed the name to A. C. Gilbert Company and expanded his line, the best known toys being the Erector and chemistry sets, and American Flyer trains. In addition to his business accomplishments, Gilbert was known as a great athlete. He was world's champion and Olympic first-place pole vaulter in 1908, the first man ever to top thirteen feet. He died on January 24, 1961, in Boston.</p>
