         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The C. Vann Woodward papers are a rich resource for studying the professonal life of one of the leading twentieth century American historians and the evolution of the teaching and writing of the history of the South during his lifetime. The arrangement of the papers into six series corresponds to groups of materials as they were found in Woodward's home. The heart (and majority) of the collection consists of correspondence and writings. From the correspondence the reseacher gains an understanding of the thought process that went into Woodward's approach to studying, writing, and teaching history. It also documents the collegial world of criticism that Woodward so highly valued. Woodward's friends, colleagues, and acquaintances included the leading lights in the history profession. Through letters that combined "candor with civility" they critiqued and commented on his research and writings, and he did the same for them. His relationships with his graduate students, as mentor directing pioneering research into new aspects of Southern history, professional colleague, and friend, is well documented in his letters to and from them. Of particular value in the Writing series are a number of unpublished short writings on a range of topics.</p>
         <p>There is only scattered documentation of Woodward's involvement in the civil rights movement and its location is noted in the various series descriptions. There are photographs of him in the Writings series (Books - <title render="italic">
               Mary Chesnut's Civil War
            </title>- Photographs) and in the Personal series (Photographs, and Portrait unveiling).</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Once hailed as the "dean of American History," C. Vann Woodward left an indelible mark on the study of history through a career that spanned seven decades. With considerable literary skill and a keen understanding of the region and its myths, Woodward fashioned revisionist interpretations of economic, political, and racial divides in the post-Reconstruction, or "New," South that helped to introduce the study of southern history to scholars and students outside both the region and the field. He shattered heroic images of "Bourbon" Democrats and the booster ideal of a truly prosperous and "redeemed" New South, argued that the phenomenon of segregation was relatively recent and therefore reversible, and on the whole turned a more critical and analytical eye toward a field of study that had long been marred by sentimental and apologist scholarship. Woodward's writing laid a new foundation for the study of the South, and his seminal works are basic texts for students of southern history.</p>
         <p>Comer Vann Woodward was born on November 13, 1908, in Vanndale, Arkansas, to Hugh Alison Woodward, a school administrator, and Bessie Vann Woodward, whose ancestors founded Vanndale. After attending grade school and two years of college in his home state, Woodward moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to attend Emory University, where his uncle, Comer Woodward, was dean of students. He graduated with a degree in philosophy in 1930. In between teaching jobs at the
Georgia Institute of Technology, Woodward enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University. While in New York he met W. E. B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance. After receiving an M.A. in political science in 1932, Woodward returned to Georgia Tech and became involved in a campaign to raise funds for the defense of Angelo Herndon, an African-American communist and civil rights advocate who was being tried on a death penalty charge of inciting insurrection. He also became friends with Will Alexander, head of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and J. Saunders Redding, a prominent African American writer who taught at Atlanta University. In 1933, Woodward lost his job, a misfortune he blamed on budget cutbacks, though the administration had admonished him for his involvement in the
Herndon case. After a brief turn as a surveyor of rural poverty in Georgia for the Works Progress Administration, he decided to enter graduate school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. While there he hoped to complete a biography he had begun writing about Populist leader Tom Watson.</p>
         <p>While a student in Chapel Hill, Woodward met Glenn Boyd MacLeod, whom he married in December 1937, just after receiving his Ph.D. The following year he published his dissertation. The success of <title render="italic">
               Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel
            </title> led to an invitation from Charles Ramsdell, editor of the <title render="italic">
               History of the South
            </title> series, for Woodward to write the volume on the New South. While doing research for the book, Woodward held a string of teaching jobs at the University of Florida (1937-1939), the University of Virginia (1939-1940), and Scripps College (1940-1943). On February 17, 1943, his only child, Peter Vincent, was born. Later that year, Woodward left Scripps for a three-year stint in the U.S. Naval Reserve, where he wrote classified accounts of naval battles for the Office of Naval Intelligence. One of his unclassified accounts, <title render="italic">
               The Battle for Leyte Gulf
            </title>, was published in 1947. That same year he accepted a teaching position at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. While still working on his book for the southern history series, Woodward published <title render="italic">
               Reunion and Reaction: the Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction
            </title>, based on his research for the early chapters of the New South book.</p>
         <p>Woodward's long-awaited volume on the New South was finally published in 1951. <title render="italic">
               Origins of the New South, 1877-1913
            </title> won the prestigious Bancroft Prize and cemented Woodward's reputation as one of the foremost authorities on the American South. From 1951 to 1952 he served as president of the Southern Historical Association. In 1954 he delivered the James W. Richards lectures at the University of Virginia, and in 1954-1955 he served as the Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford University.</p>
         <p>Woodward's efforts on behalf of the civil rights movement in the 1950s also garnered much attention. In 1953 the N.A.A.C.P. invited Woodward and John Hope Franklin to assist in preparing a brief for the celebrated <emph render="italic">Brown vs Board of Education</emph> Supreme Court case. Two years later his Richards lectures, which boldly challenged prevailing histories of segregation in the South, were published as a best-selling book called <title render="italic">
               The Strange Career of Jim Crow
            </title>. The book was so influential that Martin Luther King, Jr. later called it "the historical Bible of the civil rights movement."</p>
         <p>The 1960s and 1970s were perhaps Woodward's most productive years as a scholar. In the late 1950s he began co-editing the <title render="italic">
               Oxford History of the United States
            </title> series with Richard Hofstadter. In 1960, he published <title render="italic">
               The Burden of Southern History
            </title> and edited George Fitzhugh's <title render="italic">
               Cannibals All!
            </title>, and the following year he joined the Yale faculty as Sterling professor of history. In 1968 he edited a collection of essays by some of the most noted scholars of American History, published as <title render="italic">
               The Comparative Approach to American History
            </title>. He also served overlapping terms as president of both the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association in 1968-1969. His only son, Peter Vincent, died in 1969, at age 26, a few months before Woodward delivered his presidential address to the American Historical Association. In 1974, after a speech at Yale by controversial genetecist William B. Schockley was disrupted, Woodward headed a panel to outline the university's policy on freedom of speech. The Woodward Report, as it became known, still defines Yale's position on the right to free speech on campus.</p>
         <p>Woodward retired from teaching at Yale in 1977, but he remained an active and productive historian. In addition to publishing numerous articles and book reviews, he edited <title render="italic">
               Mary Chesnut's Civil War
            </title>, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1982. That same year, his wife, Glenn, died. In 1986 Woodward published <title render="italic">
               Thinking Back: the Perils of Writing History
            </title>, a retrospective look at his career and his critics. He was active in public life right up until his death. In October 1998, he co-sponsored a statement signed by 400 historians that denounced the impeachment of President Clinton. A month later, at the annual meeting of the Southern Historical Association, generations of southern historians marked Woodward's ninetieth birthday with a celebration of his life and work. He died on December 17, 1999, at the age of 91, in Hamden, Connecticut.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series consists of both incoming and outgoing correspondence and is arranged alphabetically by the last name of the correspondent. Correspondence that concerns official business of a university, professional organization, or the like is filed under the name of that body. Letters to and from prominent individuals and organizations are filed in separate folders, as are those of correspondents with whom Woodward exchanged more than a few letters. All others are arranged in general folders at the beginning of each letter of the alphabet. Additional correspondence related to Woodward's writings and various subjects can be found in Series II and Series III.</p>
               <p>There is considerable correspondence between Woodward and his colleagues, students, and publishers. These letters in particular provide insight into the professional life of one of the twentieth century's best-known scholars. With his colleagues and friends, Woodward discussed a range of topics, including mutual academic interests, their current scholarly projects, and contemporary politics. Among his more notable correspondents were Cleanth Brooks, Virginia Durr, Ralph Ellison, John Hope Franklin, Richard Hofstadter, Dumas Malone, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Walker Percy, David Potter, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Robert Penn Warren. There is also very limited correspondence with such figures as W. E. B. Du Bois, Medgar Evers, Alger Hiss, Martin Luther King, Jr., Katharine DuPre Lumpkin, and Eudora Welty.</p>
               <p>Woodward counted among his students some of the most influential historians of the late twentieth century, and he remained in touch with them long after they left Johns Hopkins and Yale. Their correspondence evolved from that of mentor and student to that of colleagues and friends. Earlier correspondence deals chiefly with research plans and dissertation progress, while later correspondence concerns everything from new book projects to family life. Among Woodward's most prominent student correspondents were John Blassingame, Bertram Wyatt-Brown, Barbara Fields, Sheldon Hackney, James McPherson, William S. McFeely, and Willie Lee Rose. There is additional correspondence between Woodward and his graduate students in Series V.</p>
               <p>University presses such as the Louisiana State University Press and Oxford University Press are also well-represented in the series. Of particular note is Woodward's correspondence with Oxford University Press regarding the <title render="italic">
                     Oxford History of the United States
                  </title> series, for which he served as a general editor from the late 1950s until his death. This correspondence includes many letters to and from Richard Hofstadter, his co-editor. There are also numerous exchanges with authors and prospective authors for the series, all of whom were well-known historians. These include Stanley Elkins, William Freehling, Merrill Jensen, David Kennedy, Eric McKitrick, and James McPherson.</p>
               <p>There is voluminous correspondence concerning both Johns Hopkins University and Yale University, where Woodward taught from 1947-1961 and 1961-1977, respectively. Folders for Johns Hopkins include letters to and from colleagues such as Charles Barker, George Boas, and Sidney Painter, and more personal correspondence can be found under each colleague's name. Folders for Yale University include correspondence with colleagues Alexander Bickel, John Blum, Peter Gay, and Howard Lamar, as well as Yale Presidents Kingman Brewster, Bartlett Giamatti, Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., and Richard Levin. As with Johns Hopkins, there is also personal correspondence filed under the last names of many of Woodward's Yale colleagues. (For additional materials on Yale, see the Series V.) In addition to general correspondence with Oxford University, there are many letters concerning Woodward's term as Harmsworth Professor in 1954-1955. These include both official correspondence dealing with his appointment at Oxford as well as personal correspondence during his year in residence there.</p>
               <p>Woodward served as president of three major professional history organizations: the Southern Historical Association (SHA) (1951-1952), the Organization of American Historians (OAH) (1968-1969), and the American Historical Association (AHA) (1969). There is a large amount of correspondence for each of these organizations, particularly the American Historical Association. Woodward presided over the AHA's contentious business meeting in 1969, when proposed constitutional amendments and an unresolved AHA presidential election incited vigorous debate over whether or not the AHA should be a strictly professional, politically-neutral organization. The debates centered in part on the question of whether the AHA should take a stand on United States involvement in Vietnam. Many of the letters for the AHA, OAH, and the SHA concern Woodward's participation as either a presenter or commentator at each organization's annual meeting. There is also considerable correspondence between Woodward and organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and such scholarly journals and newspapers as the <title render="italic">

                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Although Woodward was actively involved in the civil rights movement, there is relatively little correspondence with other activists or civil rights organizations. The most significant letters dealing with the civil rights movement are scattered throughout the series, either under files for such organizations as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or under the last names of individuals in the South who wrote to report local civil rights news. With few exceptions, the correspondence with civil rights organizations is routine correspondence dealing with meetings or conferences that Woodward was invited to attend. Of the prominent civil rights activists listed earlier, only Virginia Durr exchanged more than a few letters with Woodward.</p>
               <p>There is relatively little correspondence of a personal nature in this series. Woodward maintained semi-regular correspondence with a small number of extended relatives and friends from Arkansas and Georgia. Among them were his college friend Glenn Rainey and Arkansas friend C. R. "Dick" Huie. A handful of letters to and from his wife Glenn are included in this collection, as are a few from his only son, Peter. There are also a few letters to and from his parents, Hugh and Bessie, and his Uncle Comer. There are several letters to and from his daughter-in-law, Susan Woodward, with whom he maintained a close relationship until his death. (Researchers should consult Series VI for additional personal materials.)</p>

               <p>The series is arranged in five sections: Short Writings, Books, Book Reviews, Unpublished Writings, and Lectures. Short Writings and Unpublished Writings are the most important because both of them contain unpublished writings. The titles in Short Writings are arranged alphabetically. Those with an asterisk (*) are titles listed in the bibliography in <title render="italic">
                     C. Vann Woodward: A Southern Historian and His Critics
                  </title>, by John Herbert Roper (1997). The remaining titles, therefore, were probably never published. When folders in Short Writings contain correspondence, it is often from other historians from whom Woodward asked for critiques. The Unpublished Writings section contains writings that Woodward kept in folders entitled "unpublished", arranged chronologically. Woodward's arrangement has been maintained. The Books and Book Reviews sections are arranged alphabetically by title, and the Lectures section is one folder of promotional material.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by topic. There is particularly substantive correspondence from historians commenting on a draft of Woodward's presidential address to the American Historical Association in 1969. The commentors include Charles Barker, Peter Gay, John Higham, Richard Hofstadter, George Pierson, David Potter, and Boyd Shafer. There is also substantive correspondence between Woodward and Stanley Elkins and Eric McKitrick, regarding their dissertations, and monographs each worked on individually. Woodward recorded notes of a meeting and conversation he and several others had with Alger Hiss in 1959. Documentation of Woodward's involvement with the NAACP in school desegregation cases includes correspondence, mostly incoming, and "The Background of the Abandonment of Reconstruction," an essay written by Woodward for the NAACP. The International Council on the Future of the University, with which Woodward was affiliated from its inception, contains mostly incoming correspondence and collected materials, but there are scattered writings and correspondence by him.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by topic. The folders of material on Herbert Aptheker contain clippings and correspondence related to the decision rendered against his application for a teaching appointment at Yale. Woodward chaired the committee that reached the decision. Materials related to Woodward's work in preparing the "Woodward Report" include minutes of the Committee on Freedom of Expression, some correspondence, and a copy of the report itself. The files on graduate students of Woodward while he was at Yale are arranged by last name of student. They contain correspondence that should be used with correspondence found under the student's name in Series I. As with that correspondence, there is substantive discussion between Woodward and his students about research undertaken and planned, and professional accomplishments.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by topic. The Biographical folder includes a 1931 letter from Arthur Raper recommending that Woodward do research in the South for the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and several vitae. There are two folders of essays about Woodward, mostly pertaining to his work as a historian of the South, written by both professional historians and undergraduate students. The family materials include a miscellaneous assortment of letters, diaries, and clippings related to Vann family members. Interviews include one done by the <title render="italic">
                     Atlanta Journal-Constitution
                  </title> in 1997, and one done by Jim Green for <title render="italic">
                     Radical History Review
                  </title>. Both provide revealing information on Woodward's early family life, relations with other professional historians, and the development of his theories regarding the South. There are six folders of clippings about Woodward, broadly organized by range of dates, that primarily relate to his career as a historian.</p>
               <p>Original audio tapes in Boxes 95 and 96 may not be played. Readers may only play use copies.
