         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Ezekiel Dodge Cushing Papers consist primarily of correspondence of Ezekiel Dodge Cushing, dating from 1808 to 1820, which documents Cushing's medical education and early medical practice in Boston. The correspondence is arranged in chronological order.</p>
         <p>Letters to Cushing's parents and other family members describe his studies at Dartmouth, where he lived and worked with Nathan Smith. There are also letters from his sojourn in Rush, Barton, and Physick, as well as observations on current affairs and the population of the city. Letters from 1812 â€“ 1813 document Cushing's work in London and Paris. There are also letters to Cushing frrom English acquaintances. Letters in 1815 relate to Cushing's medical practice in Boston and also convey Cushing's feelings on meeting his future wife and later on his impending marriage.</p>
         <p>Later correspondence primarily concerns Cushing's medical practice and family affairs. Included in the files after 1815 are letters to Cushing from Nathan Smith. There correspondence files also include letters addressed to other family members. The last folder in the papers contains legal and financial documents and notes on Cushing Family genealogy.</p>
         <p>The Ezekiel Dodge Cushing Papers were purchased by Dr. Harvey Cushing from Frank S. Collins, a rare book and manuscript dealer, in 1937. Though Harvey Cushing was only distantly related to Ezekiel Dodge Cushing, the Ezekiel Dodge Cushing Papers were stored as part of the Harvey Cushing materials housed in the Yale University Medical Historical Library. They were transferred to Manuscripts and Archives in April, 1989.</p>

         <p>Ezekiel Dodge Cushing was born on January 2, 1790, in Pembroke, Massachusetts. He was the first of seven children born to Nathaniel and Mehetabel Dodge Cushing. Ezekiel Dodge Cushing graduated from Harvard College in 1808, and then attended Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he lived and studied with Nathan Smith. He received his M.D. degree in 1811 and pursued further medical studies in Philadelphia.</p>
         <p>In 1812 Cushing went abroad for further medical training, first at the St. Thomas Hospital in London and after August, 1813, in Paris, where he observed in the Paris Hospital. Cushing returned to Boston in 1814 where he established his medical practice and in 1815 courted and married Delia Sawyer, daughter of David and Mary Haldane Sawyer.</p>
         <p>Sometime in the early 1820s the Cushing family moved to Hanover, Massachusetts. It was here that Ezekiel Dodge Cushing died on April 5, 1828.</p>
