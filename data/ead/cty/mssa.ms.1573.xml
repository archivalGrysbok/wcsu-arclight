         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Casimir Zagourski was born in Poland in 1880. After a military career in the Russian air force and the Polish army, he left Eastern Europe and moved to Africa in 1924. He settled in Leopoldville, which is now Kinshasa, Congo, where he began his career as a photographer. During the next seventeen years, until his death in 1941, Zagourski traveled around Central Africa photographing its people, places, and local traditions. At the same time, he established and maintained a store in Leopoldville to sell these images as postcards and large prints. He also exhibited his work at the Paris World's Fair in 1937.</p>
