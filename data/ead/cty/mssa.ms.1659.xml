         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Born on April 19, 1917, in New York City, Florence Wald became a pioneer and a leading voice in the development of hospice care in the United States. Wald obtained a B.A. from Mount Holyoke College in 1938, an M.N. from the Yale University School of Nursing in 1941, and an M.S. from the Yale University Graduate School in 1956. From 1941 to 1943, she served as a staff nurse for the New York Visiting Nurse Service, from 1946 to 1952 she was a research assistant at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, and from 1955 to 1957, she was an instructor at Rutgers University School of Nursing. In 1957, Wald became a faculty member in the Yale University School of Nursing, where she has served as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Research Associate, Dean, and Clinical Professor.</p>
         <p>In 1963, Wald met Cicely Saunders, the founder of the hospice movement in Great Britain and the director of St. Christopher's Hospice in London. During the second half of the 1960s, Wald and Saunders met several times in England and the United States and began to explore and conceptualize the possibilities of bringing hospice care to America. In late 1968, Wald began a two year grant supported study of dying patients. She set up an interdisciplinary team of health care providers and a spiritual advisor to care for the terminally ill. In exchange for care, the patients allowed the research team to keep notes to be used in determining the viability of developing an on-going hospice care program. The research developed into the beginning of institutionalized hospice care in the United States, and at the completion of the study, the group formed Hospice, Inc. and began planning a program and facility to provide hospice care in the New Haven area.</p>
         <p>Florence Wald served on the Board of Directors and the planning staff for Hospice, Inc. until 1975, when she resigned due to internal conflicts. Upon her resignation, Wald was formally acknowledged as the Founder of Hospice, Inc. Wald continued to be an advocate for the hospice movement through publications, conference presentations, and consultant work, while she returned to teaching in the Yale School of Nursing. She participated in many national and international research groups within the hospice movement, most notably the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement. Wald is the recipient of many honors, including honorary doctorates from Mount Holyoke College and the University of Bridgeport School of Nursing, the Founders Award from the National Hospice Organization, and the Contribution to Hospice Award from the National Association of Home Care. In 1998, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.</p>
         <p>As one of the original incorporators, Henry Wald also played a critical role in the founding of Hospice, Inc. He served as a member of the Board of Directors until 1977, and chaired the Building and Site Committee. As an architect and engineer who specialized in the design of health care facilities, he was instrumental in developing the facility of Hospice, Inc. in Branford, CT. Wald's 1971 thesis for his masters degree from the Columbia University School of Architecture, "A Hospice for Terminally Ill Patients," became a widely consulted source on the design of hospice care facilities. Henry Wald died on December 22, 2000. Florence Wald died on November 8, 2008, in her home in Branford, Connecticut.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>In November 1971, a group headed by Florence Wald formed Hospice, Inc. to provide care for the specialized needs of terminally ill patients and their families. Hospice, Inc. was the first organization of its kind in the United States, and it was modeled on St. Christopher's Hospice in London, England. In 1972, Hospice, Inc. started architectural planning, began raising funds, and developed guidelines for the selection of patients, staff, and volunteers. In 1973, the organization established the home care program, which began seeing patients in 1974. The inpatient program began seeing patients in 1979, with the completion of the hospice facility in Branford, CT. Also in 1979, Hospice, Inc. changed its name to Connecticut Hospice, Inc. to reflect that the organization provided care for the whole state of Connecticut. From its inception, the hospice has served as an education and research locus for the hospice movement, and it has hosted and participated in many national and international meetings and conferences. Researchers can find general overviews of the history of Hospice, Inc. under "Clippings," "Kerns, Larry," and "Newsletters."</p>
               <p>The series documents the founding, planning, growth, and administration of Hospice, Inc. Arranged alphabetically by subject and type of material, the files include correspondence, memoranda, reports, budgets, minutes, clippings, newsletters, task force and committee records, and other miscellaneous materials. The bulk of the materials range from 1971 to 1975, the time in which Florence Wald worked for Hospice, Inc. Files which document Wald's 1975 resignation can be found under "Wald, Florence."</p>
               <p>The administrative records of the institution are scattered throughout the series. Records of the Board of Directors provide an overview of the hospice through reports and meeting minutes. Folders listed under the Home Care Program, Inpatient Care Program, Committees and Task Forces sections give a more detailed view of the functioning of each of the various parts of the organization. Folders filed under "Case support of Hospice, Inc." and "Task Forces-Philosophy and Internal Organization" document discussions concerning the vision and goals of Hospice, Inc..</p>
               <p>The planning and construction of the physical plant for Hospice, Inc. is recorded in several files, including "Architectural planning," "Chan, Lo-yi [hospice architect]," "Committees-Building," "Inpatient Care Program-Facilities," "Task forces-Building," and "Wald, Henry." Similarly, financial records of the organization are spread between the Finances and Fund-raising sections and the "Committees-Development" and "Task Forces-Finance" folders.</p>
               <p>The series also documents the educational role in the hospice movement that Hospice, Inc. and its staff played. Records of the research conference "Interdisciplinary Study of a Dying Patient" include early discussions between Hospice staff and advisors, including Cicely Saunders, which were used in founding Hospice, Inc. The "Colloquia on the Humanities and Death" folders contain materials documenting a series of conferences sponsored by the hospice. Related materials on hospice education and research can be found throughout Series II.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the Hospice Movement Subject Files are comprised of correspondence, newsletters, brochures, clippings, writings, and other miscellanea pertaining to other hospices and to the hospice movement in general. The materials in the series represent a cross-section of the hospice movement and place the activities of Hospice, Inc. into the broader context of hospice work on national and international levels.</p>
               <p>Florence Wald's interactions with hospice pioneer Cicely Saunders can be found under files for St. Christopher's Hospice. These files include correspondence and notes Wald took on visits to St. Christopher's while conducting initial research on hospices. Notes that Wald recorded while visiting other English hospice sites can be found under files for the Copper Cliffs Nursing Home, Douglas MacMillan Home, St. Barabas' House, and St. Luke's Nursing Home. Wald and Saunders' collaboration and active participation in the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement, the Foundation of Thanatology and the International Seminars on Terminal Care are also documented in the series.</p>
               <p>The series also contains files documenting Wald's participation in several national organizations dealing with hospice issues such as the Association of Community Cancer Centers, the National Hospice Organization, the National Institute for the Seriously Ill and Dying, and the National Cancer Institute.</p>
               <p>Additional files reflect Florence Wald's position as a consultant and contact person for individual hospices. Files for Hospice Buffalo, Inc., Hillhaven Foundation, Hospice Rhode Island, Hospice of Seattle, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Southern California, and Riverside Hospice contain extensive reports made to the National Cancer Institute in preparation for site visits made by Florence Wald. Materials pertaining to other hospices and hospice groups include newsletters, correspondence, reports, and brochures. Miscellaneous "Bibliographies," "Brochures," "Clippings," and "Newsletters," also document the hospice movement on local and national levels.</p>

Transcripts for a three part radio series from 1959 on the role of nursing in modern society are listed under "Yale Reports," the title of the radio show. "Oncology nursing core course," and "Seminar on the Chronically Ill" document Wald's efforts to incorporate the teaching of care for the terminally ill into the School of Nursing curriculum.</p>

               <p>The series primarily consists of sixteen volumes of notes, correspondence, transcripts of team meetings, interviews with patients, and other materials documenting the two year grant funded research that became known as "A Nurse's Study of Care of Dying Patients." In exchange for palliative care, approximately forty individuals allowed Wald and her team to take extensive notes on their care. The research team used the lessons learned in the study as a basis for the formation of Hospice, Inc. Arranged in loose chronological order, the volumes chart the progress of study and hold valuable evidence of the circumstances surrounding dying patients. A bibliography used while conducting the study is listed at the beginning of the series.</p>

               <p>The accession consists of correspondence, newsletters, clippings, brochures, minutes, writings, proposals, reports, and other miscellaneous materials, which are arranged alphabetically under three sections: Correspondence and topical files; Prison hospices; and Writings. The accession supplements the first three series of the main accession and adds documentation relating to Florence Wald's work with prison hospices.</p>
               <p>The Correspondence and topical files reflect Florence Wald's association with Hospice, Inc. from the 1970s until 2000. Of particular interest are documents relating staff complaints about the administration of the hospice, including but not limited to, correspondence, by-laws, complaints, and incorporation documents from the Citizens Concerned for Compassionate Hospice Care (CCCHC). The CCCHC, an organization in which Wald and other hospice founders were leaders, was established in 1999 to protest the move of Hospice, Inc. from its original site. The series also contains correspondence, both personal and professional, from Cicely Saunders and others at St. Christopher's Hospice in England, as well as information from St. Christopher's conferences in 1980 and 1982, both of which were attended by Florence and Henry Wald. Materials relating to the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement consist primarily of mass mailings, financial documents, member listings, and biographies, and also contain information from a twenty-fifth anniversary convention in Boulder, Colorado, as well as minutes, surveys, and correspondence from the first years of the group's incorporation. The material relating to the Yale School of Nursing consists of administrative documents from Wald's years as dean and other correspondence, newsletters, and reports from subsequent years as Wald served on faculty and as dean emerita. Also in the series are materials relating to Florence Wald's efforts to help create hospices in prisons, a movement begun in 1992 by Fleet Maull, who was a Colorado inmate at the time.</p>
