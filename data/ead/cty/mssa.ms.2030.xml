         <p>The Black Panther Party was an African American revolutionary party founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California. The group was originally founded to protect members of African American communities from police brutality. It quickly developed into a Marxist revolutionary group with chapters located throughout the United States. It also became a target of J. Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI, an opponent of communist subversive groups.
In 1969, Alex Rackley, a member of the New Haven chapter of the Panthers, was abducted, tortured and killed by fellow members who suspected he was a police informant. Nine defendants, the "New Haven Nine," were indicted on charges related to the case, including Booby Seale and Warren Kimbro, George Sams, Jr., and Lonnie McLucas, the three individuals involved in the actual killing. Sams declared that Bobby Seale, who had been speaking at Yale University during the time Rackley was held prisoner, had directly ordered the murder.
 As jury selection for the trials began in May 1970, thousands of Black Panther supporters arrived for a May Day rally in New Haven, where organizers were urging violent action. Fears of rioting led to the stationing of National Guard units around the city and the temporary closure of many local businesses. In an attempt to defuse tensions and prevent violence, Yale opened its gates to the protestors and provided basic meals.  Responding to rally organizers who were trying to incite the students to strike, students were allowed the option of not finishing their course work and receiving a pass/fail grade based on completed work but the university did not officially shut down.</p>
