         <p>JOHN METCALFE POLK (1875-1904), younger son of William Mecklenburg Polk, M.D., LL.D., Dean of Cornell University Medical College, and Ida (Lyon) Polk, and grandson of the Rt. Rev. Leonidas Polk, D.D., LL.D., first Bishop of Louisiana, and one of the founders of the University of the South, was born at Demopolis, Ala., on May 6, 1875. While in the Sheffield Scientific School he was Vice-President of the University Club, and a member of the Class Committee at graduation.</p>
         <p>After graduation he took a course in the Cornell University. Medical School, in New York City, receiving the degree of M.D. in 1899. He then entered Bellevue Hospital as interne on the Medical Side and served two years. He spent 1902 mainly in Vienna, studying pathology and medical diagnosis. In January, 1903, he entered upon his duties as Instructor in Medicine and Physical Diagnosis in Cornell Medical College. In this connection, he was appointed Adjunct Assistant Visiting Physician to Bellevue Hospital.</p>
         <p>While studying in Europe, Dr. Polk became specially interested in the blood changes produced by infectious diseases, particularly influenza, and the pneumonias associated with influenza. Continuing his studies in this direction, he had succeeded, at the time of his death, in making observations of much value, his paper upon the subject being included in the original articles published annually by the Pathological Department of the Medical School. He had already shown himself to be an instructor of great efficiency.</p>
         <p>While making an autopsy he became chilled, acute pneumonia developed in a few hours, and from this he died, on March 29, 1904, in the 29th year of his age.</p>
