         <p>Harry Kaigh Eustace was a big game hunter in Equatorial and East African jungles for twenty years, circa 1900. He was also a guide and scout, volunteering his services to British forces fighting in German East Africa. Eustace filmed the military operations as well as his hunting expeditions, obtaining some of the first authentic footage of Kilimanjaro, Taveta, Tsaro, Bura, Maketau Voi, and the Uganda Railway.</p>
         <p>After returning to England, Eustace became a renowned lecturer, narrating his films before British Royalty and geographical and zoological societies in France and England.</p>
