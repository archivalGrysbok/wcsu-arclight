         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The School and College Conference on English Archives consists of two boxes, containing approximately 700 items. The bulk of the letters are from Marion C. Sheridan, who represented New Haven High School. Miss Sheridan served as Recording Secretary and later as Chairman of the Conference. She donated the records to Yale in 1966 and 1968.</p>
         <p>The School and College Conference was established in 1925 to study and discuss the teaching of English in secondary schools and in the freshman year of college and to consider related problems such as the kind of examination in English most useful in testing fitness for college. Active membership in the conference is by invitation only, is of colleges and schools, not of individuals, and is kept small so that the meetings may have an intimate and informal character. Associate membership is not limited, however, and includes a large number of schools throughout the United States.</p>
         <p>The conference holds a two-day meeting every year. Mimeographed summaries of the transactions of these meetings and correspondence pertaining to them make up part of the collection.</p>
         <p>In 1940, the conference published the <emph render="italic">Report of the Language Committee.</emph> This was followed in 1942 by the <emph render="italic">Report of the Literature Committee</emph>. Correspondence at this time contains many discussions of revisions, additions, and bibliographies.</p>
         <p>During World War II, the conference became concerned with the way in which Army and Navy basic trainees reflected the teaching of English in American secondary schools. A special committee was appointed to study the types and extent of the incompetence of the trainees in the use of English and to offer recommendations for improving English teaching. The reports of the committee are included in the collection.</p>
