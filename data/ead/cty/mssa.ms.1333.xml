         <p>The John Rodman Paul Papers document Paul's career as a world renowned epidemiologist. They contain professional correspondence with colleagues and institutions, research notebooks and reports, and photographs. Paul's academic responsibilities at the Yale University School of Medicine as professor of preventive medicine and epidemiology are documented, and topical files highlight his work on the epidemiology of bacterial and viral diseases, especially poliomyelitis during the period of the 1930s through the 1960s. The papers include alternative scientific views and quack theories on the causes, prevention, and treatment of poliomyelitis. The papers contain little personal information.</p>
         <p>Paul wrote extensively, but the papers do not include manuscripts for most of his work. The researcher can refer to the bibliography published at the time of Paul's retirement for a relatively complete list of his publications. The files do contain correspondence associated with some of these, notably <title render="italic">
               A History of Poliomyelitis
            </title> and <title render="italic">
               An Account of the American Epidemiological Society
            </title>.</p>
         <p>In view of Paul's importance in the field of public health, there is less material in the papers than one would expect. Paul worked closely with Dorothy Horstmann during his years as administrator and researcher, and as his career was winding down and also after his death, Horstmann took responsibility for responding to some of his correspondence and publication of his remaining manuscripts. The Dorothy Horstmann Papers include additional material relating to the productive collaboration between them.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>John Rodman Paul taught at the Yale School of Medicine for more than thirty years and made critical contributions to understanding the course of viral diseases such as poliomyelitis. He also developed the concept of clinical epidemiology, which became a thriving academic discipline.</p>
         <p>Paul was born in Philadelphia on April 18, 1893, to Henry N. Paul and the former Margaret C. Butler. He earned his A.B. in 1915 from Princeton University and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1919. After serving as an assistant pathologist at Johns Hopkins from 1919 to1920, he interned at the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia from 1920 to 1922. He remained at the Pennsylvania Hospital until 1928 as director of the Ayer Clinical Laboratory.</p>
         <p>In 1928, he came to the Yale School of Medicine as an assistant professor of internal medicine and rose to the position of professor and chairman of the newly created department of preventive medicine in 1940. Paul helped devise the serological test known as the Paul-Bunnell test to identify mononucleosis in 1931. While working on the epidemiology of rheumatic fever with Indian children from Canadian to the Mexican border, he established the role of hemolytic streptococcus in the infection.</p>
         <p>In 1931, Paul and colleague Dr. James D. Trask founded the Yale Poliomyelitis Study Unit. In 1938, they received the first research grant from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was renewed annually for thirty years. They identified strains of poliovirus in human waste and found the same strains in sewage.</p>
         <p>During World War II, Paul served as director of the Neurotropic Virus Disease Commission of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB). In 1943, Paul headed the Virus Commission, which included Albert Sabin. The commission went to North Africa and while in Egypt confirmed the diagnosis of poliomyelitis among U.S. and British troops. The virus was unknown in the adult Egyptian population, and Paul hypothesized that young Egyptian children acquired immunity after early exposure to the virus, but that the troops who had not been exposed to the virus before contracted polio at a surprising rate. From his later study of Alaskan Eskimos (1949), he made the important discovery that a single experience with poliomyelitis resulted in lifelong immunity. This discovery provided the impetus for the development of immunizing vaccines.</p>
         <p>By the 1950s, Paul was a recognized international figure in virology and was asked to serve on committees for the United States Armed Forces, the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and many others. He was appointed by the United States to evaluate the Salk vaccine. He also conducted many of the early tests that confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the Sabin oral vaccine. He stimulated the development of the serum banks from persons of different ages in many different countries in order to establish reference sera for the exploration of epidemiology by serum studies.</p>
         <p>After he became professor emeritus in 1961 and until 1966, he was the director of the World Health Organization Serum Reference Bank located in the Yale Department of Epidemiology and Public Health. He was subsequently named lecturer in the history of science and medicine at Yale. His most important contribution during this period was his <title render="italic">
               A History of Poliomyelitis
            </title> (1971), which chronicled the scientific discoveries and dead ends that slowly led to the complete understanding of this disease.</p>
         <p>Paul served as president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 1938 and as president of the American College of Physicians from 1955 to 1956. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, the American College of Physicians, and granted honorary membership in the Royal Society of Medicine. Yale created an endowed chair in Paul's name in 1967. He died May 6, 1971.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the series consists of Paul's professional correspondence with colleagues, institutions, organizations, and publishers. The files reflect Paul's numerous professional contacts and the depth of his involvement with them. In addition to correspondence, some files contain materials relating to organizational committee work and conferences, such as memoranda, reports, and minutes.</p>
               <p>Through materials filed under the Yale School of Medicine, one can trace the developing specialization in public health, particularly preventive medicine and epidemiology. The series also includes documentation of Paul's long working association with Dorothy Horstmann, both as an administrator and a researcher, but very few other personal letters exist.</p>
               <p>Additional correspondence relating to Paul's publications can be found in Series III.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by topic and includes correspondence, research data, notebooks, and reports. The materials include documentation of Paul's investigative efforts on encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever, but the bulk of the material concerns studies on poliomyelitis. Materials filed under the Alaska heading relate to poliomyelitis but document a specific serological investigation of antibody levels of an isolated Eskimo population. The other poliomyelitis files cover a broader time span and include correspondence from both professionals and lay people, reflecting alternative views on the causes, prevention, and treatment of polio. The polio files also include some of Paul's research data and research reports regarding his studies. Controversies over prevention, specifically the type of vaccine are represented in the files on vaccines.</p>
               <p>The hemorrhagic fever files document studies in Korea and New Haven.</p>

               <p>The series includes personal and biographical materials and photographs. It is highlighted by the detailed handwritten journals Paul kept on his travels abroad during and after World War II. Of special interest is the journal labeled "War Diary," which covers Paul's assignment as director of the Neurotropic Virus Disease Commission of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB). Entries in the diary chronicle his work on viruses in North Africa and and the Middle East. At the end of his life, Paul had a typescript transcription made for his Japan diary, thinking that this might be published. Dorothy Horstmann may have been following his idea for the 1992 typescript of the War Diary was found in Horstmann's papers and reflects her editorial hand. It should be noted that the series includes only this transcript of the "War Diary" and not the original volume.</p>
               <p>The journals are augmented by photographs taken during Paul's travels, which are listed at the end of the series. The series also contains portraits of Paul and photographs of professional colleagues and groups. There are also records relating to several tributes to Paul in the series.</p>
