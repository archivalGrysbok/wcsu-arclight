Four poems (1897-1898) by Francis Wayland for various Bar Committee meetings are in the papers. Also included are a few letters from David Josiah Brewer and Benjamin D. Silliman, and household bills and receipts. His father, Francis Wayland, is represented by a notebook, kept by George Park Fisher, recording Wayland's lectures at Brown University on "Mental Philosophy and the Evidences of Christianity".</abstract>

         <p>These papers pertain to Francis Wayland (1796-1865) and to his son, Francis Wayland (1826-1904). Relating to the senior Wayland is a notebook kept by George Park Fisher at Brown University, "President Wayland's Lectures on Mental Philosophy and the Evidences of Christianity." George P. Fisher donated the volume to Yale University in 1907. The provenance of the other items in this collection is uncertain.</p>
         <p>Relating to the younger Wayland are several outgoing and incoming letters, including one from David Josiah Brewer of the United States Supreme Court concerning a lecture he was to give, and one from Benjamin D. Silliman concerning a portrait of Charles Kent. The remainder of the papers consist of household bills and receipts, and legal papers such as deeds and indentures generated by the younger Wayland in his capacity as justice of the peace in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Francis Wayland was born on August 23, 1826, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, also named Francis, was the longtime president of Brown Univeristy. Naturally, the younger Francis received his undergraduate education at Brown, graduating with the degree of A.B. in 1846. After studying law at Harvard Law School, in Providence, Rhode Island, and Springfield, Massachusetts, he was admitted to the Massachusetts bar. He began practicing law in Worcester, Massachusetts. On October 6, 1857, he married Martha Read of New Haven, where he soon moved. In 1864 and 1865, he was judge of probate for the New Haven district and in 1869, he served as lieutenant-governor of Connecticut. In 1871, he was appointed instructor in law at Yale Law School and a year later became full professor. The following year, he became dean of the law school, where he served until his retirement in 1901. He died in New Haven, on January 9, 1904.</p>
