               <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
               <p>Dr. Dorrit E. Hoffleit was born on March 12, 1907, in Florence, Alabama. Her parents were German immigrants. In her early years she struggled to make her mark in the shadow of her brilliant though loving older brother and her mother's disappointment that her second child was "only a girl." Hoffleit reflects with characteristic optimism that these challenges were "blessings in disguise" which taught her both a resolute independence and a capacity for hard work. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1928. Having failed to find employment as a teacher of mathematics she took a job at Harvard College Observatory as one of the "Harvard Computers," earning forty cents an hour to her male colleagues one dollar, but she flourished under the mentorship of the Director Harlow Shapley. Under his direction she earned her PH.D. from Radcliffe in 1938, for which she won the Caroline Wilby Prize for the best original research. Her association with Harvard Observatory, first as an assistant, then research associate and, from 1948, as astronomer, continued until 1956.</p>
               <p>After war service at the Ballistic Research Laboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, Hoffleit returned to Harvard to develop her thesis work on meteors and bright stars. In 1956 she left Harvard when Harlow Shapley retired and joined Yale as a research associate (subsequently, Senior Research Astronomer and Lecturer) at the Yale Observatory, where she authored the Yale Catalog of Bright Stars, the most popular catalog in astronomy. Her prodigious output also included the Yale Parallax Catalog, several volumes of the Yale Zone Catalog and many hundreds of papers on astronomy. Although she officially retired from Yale in 1975, she continued her research on variable stars and in 1988 her Bright Star catalog won the George van Biesbroeck Award for dedication to astronomy. While at Yale, Dr. Hoffleit directed the summer school on Nantucket at the Maria Mitchell Observatory, where she gave many young women scientists their first experience in astronomical research. For this she was awarded the American Astronomical Society-Annenberg Prize for science education in 1993. In 2003 she was made Senior Research Astronomer Emerita at Yale Observatory.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hoffleit's many awards include honorary degrees from Smith College (1984) and Central Connecticut State University (1998). She was inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame in 1998. She was a past president of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Asteroid Dorrit was named after her, and a Hoffleit Assistantship was established at the Mitchell Observatory to honor her work.</p>
               <p>Her interview for the Yale Women's Oral History Project was recorded shortly before her 100th birthday. Dorrit Hoffleit died April 9, 2007.</p>

               <p>In her interview Dorrit Hoffleit talked at length about her early life and influences. Her mother's disappointment at producing "only" a daughter left its mark. Dr. Hoffleit reflected, "And so I was only the girl all my life, even to this day… People didn't expect so much of me, so I could work at my own pace." As a young girl during World War I she suffered anti-German bullying which made her something of a loner. Dr. Hoffleit never married, partly because her mother was unhappily married and partly because she feared that might pass on her grandmother's mental illness to subsequent generations.</p>
               <p>For her the most important issue, much more important than status and salary, was the independence she needed to follow her intellectual passions: "Having as much independence as I did in astronomy … was really something precious, very precious."</p>

               <p>Dorothy G. Singer was born in New York City on February 4, 1927, and grew up in Riverdale, New York. After attending Walton High School in the Bronx, one of the first all-girls high schools in New York, she went to Hunter College, where she developed a passion for the classics. She graduated with an A.B. in Humanities in 1948. Shortly after graduation she met Jerome L. Singer, and they married the following year. She won, but did not take, a fellowship to study archaeology at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York City. Instead the young couple moved to Philadelphia where Jerome Singer continued to pursue his Ph.D. in psychology. Dorothy Singer worked for an advertising agency but also took courses at Temple University, including psychology. When the couple moved back to New York, she undertook a part-time Master's degree in psychology at New York University, graduating in 1952, shortly before the birth of her first child.</p>
               <p>She postponed further academic pursuits until her third child was in kindergarten, when she enrolled in the Columbia University's Teachers' College doctoral program. There she was mentored by Morton Deutsch. She graduated in 1966 with a Ph.D. in School Psychology, and worked in a variety of research and counseling positions until 1968 when she joined Manhattanville College to teach psychology. She became department chair in 1972 but then left to take up a joint appointment in psychology at the University of Bridgeport and Yale University, her husband having accepted a professorship at Yale. At Bridgeport she developed many interdisciplinary courses, becoming the William Benton Professor of Psychology and eventually chair of the department. She left Bridgeport in 1990 to devote more time to her work as co-director of the Yale University Family Television Research and Consultation Center, which she and her husband had founded in 1975. The Center's work made a major contribution to the debate on the effect of television on children's learning and behavior. The Singers designed a national television curriculum for teenagers and conducted a major study for the United States Congress on educational programming for children. In addition to her work as co-director of the Center, since 1976 Dorothy Singer has been a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Psychology and the Child Study Center at Yale University, where she is a distinguished teacher as well as researcher.</p>
               <p>Dorothy Singer has contributed over 130 articles on child psychology, media and communication, and written or co-authored many books, including <title render="italic">
                     Handbook of Children, Culture and Violence
                  </title> (Sage Publications, 2006) and <title render="italic">
                     Play=Learning
                  </title> (Oxford University Press, 2006). She has been a consultant to dozens of corporations including HBO and Walt Disney. She received the 1997 Distinguished Contribution to the Science of Psychology Award from the Connecticut Psychological Association and in 2006, the Distinguished Alumni Award from Teachers' College, Columbia University.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Dorothy Singer talks extensively about an academic career which has spanned over forty years, and in particular reflects at length on the challenges she encountered in balancing family life and duties with her professional needs and aspirations, and on the choices she made. She also talks about her love of teaching and research, especially of the interdisciplinary and collaborative kind, and student mentoring. She speaks about tenure issues, salary differentials, nepotism rules, discrimination against women in academic publishing, and how these matters have either impacted her personally or academic women in general. She considers the ways in which life has changed for women in academia in her lifetime, the advances made, and what changes she believes need to be made to achieve gender and racial equality in academic life at Yale and beyond. In addition, she talks at some length about her early life, particularly her mother's influence. She also describes her experience of American suburban culture as a young mother in the 1950s and early 1960s.</p>

               <p>Millicent ("Penny") Demmin Abell was born February 15, 1934, in Wichita, Kansas.  In 1945 her father died suddenly and her mother immediately moved the family to Colorado.  The family was peripatetic for several years, but finally settled in Colorado Springs when Abell was a junior in high school.  She attended Colorado College on a scholarship, and took a B.A. in 1956 after having dropped out for a year owing to illness.  She had hoped to become a doctor but was dissuaded by her teachers on the grounds that it was too difficult for women to succeed in medicine.  Instead, Abell went to Columbia University for a master's degree in student personnel work.  She worked first at Duke University and then Arizona State University, where she was Assistant Dean of Women for two years.</p>
               <p>In 1962 Penny Abell married Julian ("Buck") Abell, a career military officer, and from that time she assumed that her career would fit around her husband's.  When he was posted to West Point Military Academy, she worked there as a reference librarian, and, in 1965, took a Master's in Library Science at SUNY, Albany, in order to give her a portable career.  When Buck Abell was sent overseas, she resigned and joined him in Bangkok.  There she found work at the Institute for International Education and took the opportunity to travel extensively in Southeast Asia.</p>
               <p>The Abells returned to the U.S. in 1966.  Abell took a job as Reference Librarian at Penrose Public Library, Colorado Springs, where her husband was then based, but she soon decided that she wanted to enter academic librarianship.  This led her to complete a Master's in Political Science at the University of Colorado in 1969.   During this time the Abells had a son.  The family moved to Seattle in 1969 when Julian Abell, having left the army, returned to graduate studies.  Penny Abell was hired as Assistant Librarian in the Business Administration Library at the University of Washington, Seattle, and in 1971 was promoted to Assistant Director of Libraries at the University of Washington.  In 1973, she became the Associate Director of University Libraries at SUNY, Buffalo.  From that moment, her career became the primary one in the Abell family.  In 1976, she was sought out as University Librarian at the University of California, San Diego, where she remained until 1985, when she was appointed University Librarian at Yale University.  She retired from Yale in 1994.</p>
               <p>Penny Abell was active in national and international library organizations.  She was a founding member of both the Commission on Preservation and Access and the Digital Preservation Consortium.  She was on the Board of Directors of the Center for Research Libraries, 1979-1986, and its chair, 1984-1985.  Abell also served on the Board of Governors of the Research Libraries Group in 1985, and was a member of the executive committee, 1986-1991.</p>
               <p>In addition, she was a consultant prior to and following her retirement, advising university administrators and libraries at many institutions, including Columbia, Harvard and Toronto universities, and the New York Public Library.  In 1998 she was called upon to serve as interim director of the University of California Berkeley Library.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Penny Abell begins her interview by looking back on her childhood and the effect her father's early death had on the family and how it continued to reverberate in her own life as a young adult.  She then briefly discusses her education and career aspirations, describing her college education and early professional life in student personnel management.  On a number of occasions throughout the interview Abell explores how she and her husband negotiated their careers within their marriage.  An explanation is given of why she decided to switch careers and become a librarian.</p>
               <p>The greater part of the interview traces her subsequent career as a senior administrator in academic libraries, first at SUNY, Buffalo, then University of California at San Diego, and finally and in most detail, her years as the University Librarian at Yale.  A recurrent theme is the challenges women in senior management faced in the academic environment, with many examples given from her own experience.   For example, she describes how her senior male colleagues responded to Title IX, the role a pregnancy may have played in compromising her first major promotion, and what it was like for much of her professional career to be often the only woman at meetings.    She examines how feminism from Betty Friedan onwards informed her life and her ambivalence towards second wave feminism.</p>
               <p>Reflecting back on her career at Yale, she discusses the challenges of being the first female University Librarian at Yale, and her relationships with Yale faculty and administration.  She recalls how she got the job, and her relationship with Bart Giamatti, then president of Yale.  She addresses specific issues in the library wherein gender (and sometimes race) was to some extent a complicating factor.  These included many budgetary and personnel challenges, including: the management of the Walpole Library; the aftermath of the 1984-1985 ten-week strike by clerical and technical workers belonging to the Local 34 union (which ended shortly before she took up her position at Yale); gender relationships within Yale Library, which had the largest concentration of women employees within the university (in managerial and professional as well as clerical positions), and the sources of conflict between her and her senior management team.   Further, she discusses her relationships with other senior women at Yale, including Provosts Judith Rodin and Alison Richard.  Abell recalls the regular informal meetings she had with Richard, when she was Director of the Peabody Museum, Mimi Neill (now Gates) who then was Director of Yale University Art Gallery, and Stephanie Spangler, the Director of University Health Services.   The purpose of these meetings was mutual help, support, networking and mentoring, as well as political strategizing.  She also pays tribute to Diane Turner and her contribution to changing labor relations within the Library. Continuing with the theme of mentoring, Abell acknowledges the support and mentoring of a number of men at Yale, especially Charles "Chip" Long in the Provost's Office, and Jaroslav Pelikan, Sterling Professor of History.</p>
               <p>Abell concludes the segment on Yale by talking about what she regards as her greatest achievements as University Librarian, her commitment to changing what she terms the cultural dynamics of the Library, and why she left Yale.  Finally, in the course of the interview, Abell talks at length about the evolution of her own management style, her views on the qualities required for effective leadership, and how these may be best nurtured in women.</p>

               <p>Ann Tomaino Ameling was born in 1941 and grew up in Danbury, Connecticut.  She was the only child of an Italian-American father who won a scholarship to Yale College (Class '25).  He subsequently trained at Yale Medical School.  Her mother was a nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital, who gave up her job upon marriage.  In 1962 Ameling graduated from Smith College, with a major in psychology.  Her family discouraged her from following her father's profession, and she rejected the academic life because she saw that very few women attained tenure at that time. So Ameling opted for a career in nursing. Having earned a nursing degree from the Columbia University School of Nursing, she then worked at the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Institute at the Cornell Medical Center, New York.  In 1965 Ameling entered Yale School of Nursing to take a Master of Science degree in Nursing, specializing in psychiatric nursing.</p>
               <p>Immediately following her graduation in 1967 Ameling joined the faculty at the Yale School of Nursing as a lecturer.  She was an assistant professor 1970-1976, associate professor from 1976-1985, and tenured in 1984.  During this time she was one of the first nursing school faculty (apart from deans) to become a fellow at a Yale residential college.  Subsequently Ameling spent a semester as Acting Master at Berkeley College, and then was appointed Master of Saybrook College, serving 1985-1990.  She joined Yale's central administration in 1989 as Associate Provost in charge of the School of Nursing, the School of Music, the Divinity School, the School of Forestry, the Center for British Art, the Yale Art Gallery, the residential colleges, and a number of academic departments including Classics, Religious Studies, Judaic and Near Eastern Studies.  After more than a decade in Yale University's central administration, she returned to full-time teaching at the Nursing School.  During this time she devoted much of her time to curriculum development, developing alternative and complementary therapies and end-of-life care as part of a multi-disciplinary Spirituality and Health curriculum. These innovations were funded by a grant from the Templeton Foundation and were taught in the Medical and Divinity Schools as well as in the Nursing School.  After her retirement in 2003, Ameling returned to Yale as a student, this time at the Divinity School, to train as a United Church of Christ minister.</p>
               <p>In the early part of her career at the Yale nursing school, she worked extensively in the area of chronic psychiatric illness, and was the Principal Investigator on one of the first funded research projects evaluating psychiatric nursing care with the chronically ill psychiatric outpatient population (United States Psychiatric Health Service, 1970-1975).  Ameling is the author of many articles on chronic psychiatric illness.  Her 1982 book (with Yale colleague Judith Krauss), <title render="italic">
                     The Chronically Ill Psychiatric Outpatient in the Community
                  </title>, was named <title render="italic">
                     The American Journal of Nursing
                  </title> Book of the Year. She also has written a number of articles on spirituality and healing.</p>

               <p>Ann Ameling talks at length about her family background, particularly her childhood memories of Yale and her undergraduate experiences at Smith College, with special emphasis on its social culture. She recalls her early studies in nursing at Columbia University, her growing awareness of gender issues in medicine (especially obstetrics), and her subsequent experiences as a psychiatric nurse at the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Institute. The reasons why she chose Yale School of Nursing for her graduate work are then discussed, followed by an account of her experience of the Nursing School, first as a graduate student and then as a young faculty member.  The school's internal culture is described, with reference to such issues as gender, sexism, and relationships between faculty and students. Its problematic external relations with the wider Yale community, especially with the Medical School, are addressed. Ameling also talks about the unique place of the school at Yale as a locus for high-achieving women and about the women on its faculty who became her role models or mentors, such as Florence Wald, Rita Dumas, Rachel Robinson, Margaret Arnstein and Donna Diers.</p>
               <p>Ameling recalls her early experiences in the Berkeley College fellowship, how gradually she became involved in university administration, and the role diversity initiatives played in providing opportunities for her advancement.  An account is given of the difficulties she experienced, both as a woman and as a member of the Nursing School, in chairing her first university committee. Looking back on her time as Acting Master at Berkeley and Master of Saybrook, she describes the challenges of these positions, and the extent to which her gender complicated them.  Her time in Yale's central administration, which culminated in her seven years as associate provost, is then discussed. She recalls her relationships with Provosts Frank Turner, Judith Rodin and Alison Richard, as well as gender and power relations within the Provost's Office. Ameling outlines the pressures involved in managing her diverse responsibilities, especially at a time of economic stringency, and the battle to prevent the closure of the Nursing and Divinity schools. She describes the evolution of Yale's retirement and maternity policies, explaining her role in the implementation of the Yale family leave policy and domestic partner benefit plan, the ways in which being a woman influenced her position on these issues, and her own maternity and childcare arrangements.  The role gender played in the development of her management style, and the nature of her own feminist sensibility, are covered. Ameling discusses how salary inequities, the abolition of mandatory retirement, and Yale's tenure system, affected younger faculty, particularly women. In this context she talks about her commitment to the mentoring of young faculty and administrators.</p>
               <p>Ameling then explains why she left the central administration, giving an account of the personal costs she believed she incurred, and identifying what she regards as her greatest achievements as assistant provost.  Next she turns to her second period on the YSN faculty and her struggle to find a new direction in her scholarship and teaching.  Finally, she talks about her decision to become a student at the Yale Divinity School (including her experience of being a student again), and shares her views on the current situation of women in the academy and changing perceptions of the role of the university in society.</p>

               <p>Marie Borroff was born on September 10, 1923, in New York City.  She completed high school at the age of fifteen, after which she spent a year studying piano at the Chicago Conservatory and some time earning a living playing the piano in New York.  She earned her undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, where she won the James Billings Fiske poetry prize in 1943.   Before coming to Yale for her Ph.D. in English Literature and Philology, which she completed in 1956, she was a teaching assistant at the University of Chicago, 1946-1947, and then an instructor in English at Smith College, 1948-1951.  After completing her Ph.D. Borroff returned to Smith as an Assistant Professor, and then Associate Professor, from 1956-1959.   In 1959, she became the first woman to teach in the English Department at Yale, and in 1965 she became the first woman to be appointed as tenured Professor of English, and only the second woman to be tenured in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the university.  In 1991, she became the first woman on the faculty to be named a Sterling Professor.  Marie Borroff retired in 1994.</p>
               <p>During her forty years on the Yale faculty, Marie Borroff held many administrative and committee positions, most notably Faculty Counselor to the Presidential Search Committee, 1992-1993, in which she was charged with relaying the views of the faculty to the committee.  In 1984 she served as wordsmith for the seminal <title render="italic">

               </p>
               <p>Marie Borroff's varied scholarly interests encompass the poetry of both the Middle Ages and the twentieth century.  In 1963, she published <title render="italic">

               <p>Marie Borroff begins by talking about the newly established Marie Borroff Professorship and its significance to her.  She pays tribute to her upbringing, especially how her father, a man of little formal education, encouraged independence and intellectual excellence, against the prevailing attitudes on the education of women.  Her mother was a talented pianist and from their earliest childhood playing the piano was a daily discipline for Borroff and her sister. She recounts her early discovery of poetry and the role of music in her life, both as a source of income as a young woman, and as an inspiration in her literary scholarship.  Borroff recalls the social and intellectual challenges of her student years at the University of Chicago, its unique Ph.B. (Bachelor of Philosophy) undergraduate program, and the influence and mentorship of two Chicago teachers, Norman Maclean and R. S. Crane.  Life as a graduate student at Yale is described: her experience of living in the women's dormitory; her relationships with other graduate students including E. D. Hirsch; and how she was mentored by her exclusively male teachers, Helge Kokeritz, John C. Pope and E. Talbot Donaldson.  Borroff talks at length about the social expectations of women at Smith College especially the Ivy League "mixer" culture, and the effect of that culture on the first cohort of women undergraduates at Yale. Borroff remembers how she got her first job at Yale, how she secured tenure and what it was like to teach male undergraduates.  Much is said about the intellectual and social culture of the Yale English Department, her male colleagues and their wives, and her experience of being the only woman in the department for many years.  Borroff recalls her encounters with the sinologist Mary Clabaugh Wright, the only other tenured woman in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at that time.  The arrival of the first junior female faculty in the mid-1960s is addressed, and the extent to which gender became a complicating issue in the historic division between junior and senior faculty at Yale. Borroff talks about her experiences of mentoring the younger, junior women faculty, and her attempts to ameliorate what she considers to be the exploitation of several of them.  She describes her involvement in the Helen Hadley Hall Fellowship for women at Yale, and how she became a Fellow at Ezra Stiles College.  She discusses her work on the 1984 Crothers Report on the education of women at Yale; her views on co-education; feminism, discrimination and affirmative action at Yale; the challenges she faced as an interim Director of Graduate Studies; her contribution to the Presidential Search Committee, 1992-1993; and why she did not pursue an administrative career at Yale.  Finally Borroff considers the changing role of the humanities in American culture, and the growing place of women in academia.</p>

               <p>Winifred W. Doane was born on January 7, 1929, and raised on City Island, New York. Her parents were educators and firm advocates of women's education: her father a founding member of the School of Architecture at City College, and her mother a special education teacher for many years on Manhattan's Lower East Side.   A talented all-rounder at Walton High School in the Bronx, Doane was inspired by her science teacher to major in science at university.  She graduated from Hunter College in 1950 with a B.A. in zoology and botany, winning many of the science prizes.   In 1952, she gained a M.S. in Zoology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.    She began her doctoral studies there but married a fellow graduate student, Charles "Chuck" Doane the following year when he completed his Ph.D.  Their early married life was somewhat peripatetic as Doane's husband established his career, but they had also agreed that once they settled Doane would continue her doctoral studies.  Consequently, she taught at Millsaps College, Mississippi, for two years, then at Washington University, St. Louis, before coming to New Haven, Connecticut. where Chuck Doane took a position at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.  Winifred Doane enrolled on the Yale Ph.D. program, graduating in 1960.  The Doanes adopted a baby son in 1965.</p>
               <p>During nearly twenty years at Yale, Winifred Doane held a number of appointments:  laboratory teaching assistant in Zoology (1956-1958), National Science Foundation Predoctoral Research Fellow (1958-1960), National Institutes of Health Postdoctoral Trainee in Genetics (1960-1962), Faculty Research Associate, Biology (1962-1975) and Lecturer, Biology (1965-1975).   She was one of the early test cases in which the newly established Yale Affirmative Action office attempted to have a number of Yale's longstanding women scientists promoted into faculty ladder positions in order to give them the possibility of tenure.  This resulted in Doane's promotion to Associate Professor, Biology (1975-1977).  Doane's husband retired soon after this, leaving her free to apply for a tenured position elsewhere.  She was appointed Professor of Zoology at Arizona State University in 1977, and then Professor, Molecular/Cell Biology, in 1992.  She retired in 1998.</p>
               <p>Winifred Doane specialized in the developmental, biochemical and molecular genetics of Drosophila (fruit flies) and other insects. One of her major discoveries was to identify the "skinny gene" (adipose).  She was the recipient of many research grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation throughout her academic life.  She is the author of more than 120 research papers and articles related to her work. A major review chapter on the role of hormones in insect development was contributed to S.J. Counce &amp; C.H. Waddington's <title render="italic">
                     Developmental Systems: Insects
                  </title> (Academic Press. 1972).</p>
               <p>Active in the Association of Women Scientists (AWIS) from its inception, she was also the founder and first president of the Central Arizona Chapter of AWIS.   Doane is an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow.  In 2009, AWIS, in conjunction with AAAS, honored her for her "commitment to the achievement of equity for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics."  Doane's service to the scientific community at a national level included being Chair of the Responsibilities Committee of the Society for Developmental Biology, 1971-1974, during which time she produced "Sexisms Satirized," a humorous book of cartoons highlighting sexism in science; she was also a member of the Congressional Liaison Committee of the Genetics Society of America, 1993-1995.   Doane was a founding council member of the ASU Emeritus College, which was established in 2004 and continued to be particularly active in its mentoring program for young faculty.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Winifred Doane begins her interview with an account of her family and educational background and the formative experiences which shaped her early life.  She talks extensively about her mother's work and familial attitudes to women's education and careers, going on to reflect on her undergraduate years at Hunter College and the beginnings of her postgraduate education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Doane recalls the graduate culture there and how she met her future husband.  Negotiating marriage and motherhood to enable her to achieve her own academic and professional ambitions is a recurrent theme in the interview.</p>
               <p>Most of the interview is devoted to the twenty years she spent at Yale.  Doane recalls various ways in which Yale was a challenging environment for women scientists, and recounts many personal experiences of sexism and discrimination, whilst, at the same time acknowledging the support and mentorship of a number of her male colleagues, like Donald Poulson and Evelyn Hutchinson whom she found supportive and respectful.  She reflects to what extent the ways in which the cultural attitudes of Yale's scientists towards women in science mirrored attitudes in the scientific world at large.  An account is given of what she encountered at the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, especially in respect of grant applications she made in the late 1960s and early 1970s. She also recalls how what she regards as the then structural sexism in the science establishment also affected her husband's career because of the fact he had a working wife.   The issue of tenure at Yale had particular difficulties for women, as she then explains, recounting in detail how they were addressed in the early years of Affirmative Action at Yale. Thus a context is provided for her own tenure experience.   Doane outlines the circumstances of her resignation from Yale and her move to Arizona State University, reflecting on both the losses and gains she experienced in terms of her career by leaving Yale.  Then she explains how her experiences at Yale influenced how she conducted her academic life after she left, and affirms her lasting commitment to mentoring young women scientists.</p>
               <p>Doane charts her growing awareness of feminist issues in the late 60s and the ambivalence she found amongst both male and female colleagues towards affirmative action.  She explains how she became involved in the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) and other scientific bodies in the early 1970s, and her commitment to raising awareness of sexism and discrimination through them. These early involvements culminated in the publication of "Sexisms Satirized" in 1976.    Finally, she shares her views on and impressions of the new generation of women scientists' prospects in academic life, addressing the issue of how women are changing the academy and how it is changing them, in the wider context of how science itself is changing.</p>

               <p>Hester Eisenstein was born October 14, 1940, in New York City into an upper middle class, intellectual, Jewish family.  In 1961 she graduated from Radcliffe College with a B.A. (<title render="italic">
                     magna cum laude
                  </title>). The following year she earned a M.A. from Yale, where she also took her Ph.D. (in 1967).  She won the Mary Cady Tew prize for the best first year graduate student in 1961.  She taught history at Yale from 1966-1970, as an instructor for the first two years and subsequently as an assistant professor.</p>
               <p>After she left Yale, she was hired as Director of the Experimental College at Barnard College where (in 1975) she introduced its first course on feminist theory and (in 1977) co-founded the Women's Studies program.  In 1980, Eisenstein moved to Sydney, Australia, for personal reasons.  From 1980-1988, she was a "femocrat" (a female senior civil servant),  working from 1981-1985 in the Office of the Director of Equal Opportunity in Public Employment in New South Wales implementing a government-funded affirmative action program for aboriginal Australians, immigrants and women.  During 1985-1988 she was chief education officer in the Equal Employment Opportunity Unit at the Department of Education of New South Wales.</p>
               <p>On her return to the United States she worked as an associate professor in American Studies and Women's Studies at the State University of New York, Buffalo.  From 1996-2000 she served as Director of Women's Studies at Queens College, City University of New York, where she is a professor of Sociology.</p>
               <p>In addition to many articles in journals and anthologies, Eisenstein's major publications include: <title render="italic">

               <p>Hester Eisenstein discusses her family background and how it influenced her choice of profession, touching on her undergraduate experience at Radcliffe and the differences between Yale and Harvard in the teaching of history.  She recalls encounters with Hannah Gray (later Yale's first female Provost) when Gray was on the faculty at Harvard, and with the historian, Mary Clabaugh Wright, who was the first woman to be tenured in Yale College.  She speaks at length about the challenge of being one of the few women graduate students in the History Department, and her relationship with such Yale historians as Robin Winks, Stanley Mellon, John Blum and C. Vann Woodward.  A lengthy account is given of the prevailing culture of Yale in general and the history department in particular, and how research in France (and subsequently the arrival of co-education in 1969 and the events surrounding May Day, 1970) enabled her, as a young faculty member, to articulate her growing socialist and feminist consciousness in her teaching practice as well as in her intellectual and political engagements.  Eisenstein discusses her association with African-American students like Armstead Robinson, and explores the extent to which women's issues were part of political activism at Yale, touching on her friendship with feminist, Naomi Weisstein.    She describes being on the Yale College Executive Committee during this period, considers the effect of the Yale tenure system on young faculty, and speculates on why she was denied tenure.  She recalls how Elga Wasserman was instrumental in her being hired by Barnard College to run its new experimental college.   Her first encounter with the contemporary feminist movement is described, together with her role in pioneering a feminist curriculum at Barnard, where she developed the Women's Studies program in association with feminist historians like Anne Kar Baxter.  She recalls the first <title render="italic">
                     The Scholar and The Feminist
                  </title> Conference and the first National Women's Studies Association conference in 1977. In the context of her experience as a senior civil servant in Australia, she explores the term "femocrat" and the role of feminism in Australian public policy in the 1980s.  Her interview concludes with a critique of contemporary American academic feminism and the future of Women's Studies in the context of 21st century globalization.</p>

               <p>Margaret Farley was born in 1935 and brought up in St. Cloud, Minnesota, in a Roman Catholic family. Her father taught at St. John's University in St. Joseph. Her mother had a college education but was a homemaker until the children were raised, when she took a degree in guidance counseling and became a fulltime counselor at a local high school.   Farley took a B.A. in English at the University of Detroit in 1957, and a M.A. in Philosophy there in 1960.  She entered the order of the Sisters of Mercy at the age of 24, and taught philosophy at the Mercy College in Detroit for five years from 1962-1967.  By this time Farley knew that she wanted to commit to the academic life, so in 1967 she came to Yale to pursue a doctorate in the Religious Studies department.  She graduated in 1973.</p>
               <p>Margaret Farley began her teaching career at Yale in 1971, when she became the first woman to serve fulltime on the faculty of Yale Divinity School.  At the same time, she and Henri Nouwen became the first Roman Catholic faculty appointments at the school.  She taught Christian Ethics at Yale for more than 30 years, as a lecturer 1971-1972, Assistant Professor, 1972-1974 and Associate Professor 1974-1984.  In 1986 she was appointed to the Gilbert L. Stark Chair in Christian Ethics, and in 2007 she retired.</p>
               <p>Her honors include eleven honorary degrees, the John Courtney Murray Award for Excellence in Theology, and a Luce Fellowship in Theology. Farley is a past president of the Society of Christian Ethics and the Catholic Theological Society of America.  She was a founder of the "Project on Gender, Faith, and Responses to HIV/AIDS."  In addition to being a co-director of the Yale University Interdisciplinary Bioethics Project, she served on the Bioethics Committee of Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.</p>
               <p>Farley has been a progressive theological voice in many spheres, including feminist theology, ethics and spirituality, medical ethics, women's ordination, sexuality, and the environment.  She has written more than eighty articles addressing such issues and is also the author and co-author of several books, including: <title render="italic">

               <p>Margaret Farley talks about her family background and upbringing, and the role of education in family life. She reflects on her own career expectations and the assumptions she made about her adult life, especially in light of her mother's experiences.   After talking briefly about her own undergraduate experiences and becoming engaged to be married in her senior year,  Farley then explains how she began to reassess what she wanted to do with her life, and how this culminated in discovering a religious vocation.  She recalls the challenge of finding the order of nuns which suited her best, and why she took her final vows with the Sisters of Mercy.  A lengthy account is given of her work with this order in Detroit during the Civil Rights era, and she pays tribute to the role models of female leadership she found amongst the Sisters.</p>
               <p>Farley goes on to explain why she applied to Yale for graduate work, and recalls in detail what it was like to be a female graduate student at Yale in the late 1960s and how this contributed to her growing awareness of gender issues.  She also discusses how being an older, professional woman and a nun affected her life as a graduate student. The circumstances in which she was hired by Yale Divinity School to teach Christian Ethics are then described, along with the culture of the school during the 1970s.  Much of the rest of her interview deals with the specific gender issues she encountered during her tenure at Yale, particularly the challenge of introducing feminist theology into the curriculum, implementing inclusive language, the debate surrounding the question of women's ordination, and the foundation of the Women's Center and the role it played in supporting and mentoring women at the Divinity School.   An outline is provided of the ways in which the Women's Center and the Women Faculty and Administrators Caucus became a forum where women – faculty, administrators and students - learned together to strategize and organize on gender issues and  to identify and implement women friendly policies at the School.  Farley addresses the pressures she experienced when she was, for a considerable time, the only woman on the faculty, and the struggle to get tenure for her colleague, Letty R. Russell.  She also touches on Yale's response to affirmative action in the early 1970s, and how she challenged salary inequity.  More generally she recalls the battle to save the Divinity School from closure and her involvement in teaching in other parts of the Yale campus, notably the Medical and Law Schools.  Finally, she speaks about the value and rewards of teaching, and the position of women in contemporary academic life, and how feminism and women continue to change and shape higher education.</p>

               <p>Joan Bates Forsberg was born on the January 15, 1928, in Chatham, New Jersey., where her father was superintendent of schools.  Her mother trained as a teacher; following her marriage she became a homemaker, though remained very active in church and community.  Forsberg went to Endicott College, MA, with the intention of pursuing a radio broadcasting career, but transferred to Drew University when she received the call to ordination.  She graduated in 1950.  She was admitted to Yale Divinity School which, at that time, capped the numbers of women students to ten per year.  She received her Master's in Divinity in 1953, by which time she had married a fellow divinity student, Robert Forsberg.  She was ordained as a Congregationalist minister in 1954.</p>
               <p>For nearly twenty years Forsberg's primary role was as wife and mother, raising a family in New Haven's inner city housing projects, where her husband was part of a group ministry.  During this time she was a social activist, involved with Connecticut Planned Parenthood and its campaign to legalize contraception in the state, which culminated in her involvement in Griswold v. State of Connecticut (1965). In 1968 Forsberg took up the challenge of procuring legal and safe abortions through her involvement with the Clergy Counseling Service for Problem Pregnancies.  This period saw the development of her feminist consciousness, which ultimately led her to end her marriage.</p>
               <p>After working briefly at the Yale Divinity School's Continuing Education Center, in 1971 Dean Colin Williamson asked her to become the Divinity School's first Advocate for Women.  Initially the position was combined with that of Registrar because of funding issues.  In addition to carrying out the registrar's administrative duties, she was responsible for counseling women students, directing programs for women, teaching a course on Women and Ministry, and participating in the school's liturgical life.  Almost immediately the Divinity School's Women's Center was established under Forsberg's leadership, the first of its kind at Yale University.  In 1977 she was promoted to Assistant Dean and then Associate Dean for Student Affairs and Director of Admissions, positions she held till her retirement in 1993.  She was appointed Lecturer in Practical Theology in 1974 and received a Doctor of Divinity from Berkeley Divinity School in 1978.</p>
               <p>Yale Divinity School established the Joan Bates Forsberg Scholarship in 1993 in honor of her distinguished career in social and pastoral ministry.</p>

               <p>Forsberg begins her interview by recalling her early life in suburban New Jersey, and the expectations placed upon young women of her class and generation.  She speaks at length about her mother's life and her importance as a role model, and then recalls the childhood experience which first made her aware of gender discrimination. Her call to Christian ministry and ordination is discussed, and the changing role and empowerment of women within the church is a recurring theme in the interview.  Forsberg returns a number of times to the difficulties of balancing marriage with ministry, since she experienced them in her own life as well as observing the struggles of her peers and, later, of her students. She reflects on how prevailing theological positions, specifically those of neo-orthodoxy, helped shape her identity as a woman.  An account is given of her reasons for applying to Yale Divinity School, her experience as a student there, the prevailing social and political culture (particularly in respect of the attitudes to women amongst the faculty and her male peers), and the challenge of being a member of a tiny minority within the student body.  The liminal status of women at the school is explored in her account of the history of women's accommodation on the campus.  The 1953 Batchelder study on women at the Divinity School, and the ways that its findings related to her own experience, are addressed. Then she describes the sex discrimination which she herself suffered, especially when she married in her third year.</p>
               <p>Forsberg describes her life as the wife of a committed, radical minister and the challenge of raising a family in some of New Haven's poorest neighborhoods.  A detailed explanation is offered of her role in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), why she became involved, and how this helped shape her growing awareness of feminist issues in the late 1960s.  She then explores the relationship between second wave feminism and the development of feminist theology.</p>
               <p>The major portion of the interview is devoted to Forsberg's twenty years as Advocate for Women and the work of the Yale Divinity School's Women's Center. She explains how the position came about and its evolution in the early 1970s, as the numbers of women students began to rise once the numbers cap on women was eliminated.  Many of the pressing gender issues of the day are recalled:  the campaign to appoint women on the faculty, the barriers to women's ordination, sex discrimination within the churches, consciousness-raising, the reworking of the curriculum to teach and then mainstream feminist theology, and the challenge of introducing inclusive language into the Divinity School's sacramental and liturgical life.  Forsberg recalls her relationship with Dean Colin Williamson during the early years of the Women's Center, and the significance of Margaret Farley's appointment as the first woman on the faculty. The issues surrounding the appointment and tenuring of the feminist theologian Letty R. Russell are also covered.  She pays tribute to the ways in which Russell brought together students, faculty and administrators to organize on gender-related issues.  Forsberg recalls the responses of male students to feminist theology and activism at the School, and comments on the ways in which fissures created by race, class and sexual orientation complicated gender issues.</p>

               <p>Connie Goldman Gersick was born in 1948 in Davenport, Iowa, and was raised in Rock Island, Illinois, where her father ran the family furniture store.  She began her undergraduate education at the University of Michigan but transferred to Brandeis University at the end of her sophomore year to be closer to her boyfriend who was an undergraduate at Yale.  They had grown up in the same small Jewish community and known each other since 6th grade.   They married in June 1969 and Gersick dropped out of college to go live with her husband in New Haven.   Whilst he completed his senior year at Yale, she got a job as secretary and assistant to Elga Wasserman, who had been hired by President Kingman Brewster to oversee the implementation of coeducation at Yale.</p>
               <p>Kelin Gersick graduated in 1970 and was admitted to Harvard graduate school; Connie Gersick returned to Brandeis, graduating magna cum laude in 1971.  In her final year at Brandeis she was actively involved in the women's movement and, inspired by working for Elga Wasserman, chose a career in university administration, specializing in working with women. In 1972 she gained a M.Ed. in College and Adult Counseling at Boston University School of Education.  From 1972-1975 she was Admissions Officer and Special Programs Officer at Radcliffe College, appointed by Matina Horner who had recently become the college president.  During this time, Gersick had her first child, but continued in the post half-time.</p>
               <p>In 1975, Kelin Gersick finished his Ph.D. at Harvard and took a junior faculty position at Yale just as the Directorship of the Office on the Education of Women came vacant.  At the age of 26, Connie Gersick was appointed its Director.  She held the post for two years but then decided to return to graduate school as she believed a Ph.D. would enable her to progress more successfully in higher education administration.  She gained a doctorate in Organizational Behavior from Yale in 1984, and during this time she had her second child.  The family decided that the next move would be to further Connie Gersick's career, so they moved to California when she was appointed Assistant Professor of Management, and then Associate Professor of Human Resources and Organizational Behavior at the Anderson Graduate School of Management, UCLA, where she remained until 2001.  Whilst at UCLA she spent a year as a visiting scholar at the Harvard Business School (1996-1997) and was Co-Area Chair, Human Resources and Organizational Behavior at the Anderson School (1997-1999).  From 2001-2007 she was Associated Faculty at the Simmons School of Management.  She was the founding director of the Women's Leadership Institute, an executive education workshop at UCLA.  She is also a Research Associate at Lansberg, Gersick and Associates, and Visiting Scholar, Yale School of Management.</p>
               <p>Connie Gersick's work focuses on quantitative research in adult development; individual, group and organizational change and adaptation; and the effects of time and deadlines on work and learning. She is the author of many articles in this field and she has won a number of national awards for her research publications on group work and change processes.  At time of writing she is researching a book called <title render="italic">

In particular she describes what it was like to negotiate the social and sexual politics of the "mixer" culture.  An account is given of how Sixties countercultural values began to infiltrate campus life when the admissions policy reforms begun in 1965 by the then Dean of Undergraduate Admissions, Insley "Inky" Clarke, opened up Yale to a broader spectrum of undergraduates. Her decision to drop out of college to get married is discussed, along with her first encounter with second wave feminism.  She recalls the moment when she discovered Betty Friedan's <title render="italic">
                     Feminine Mystique
                  </title> and how it impacted on her recent marriage.</p>
               <p>Gersick discusses the work of the Yale for the Coeducation of Women and the issues surrounding coeducation, especially the pressures on the first cohort of women undergraduates.  She recalls her return to Brandeis, her growing involvement in women's issues, and her first encounter with some of the major figures in second wave feminism, especially Alice Walker.</p>
               <p>Her work as Admissions Officer and Special Programs Officer at Radcliffe College is briefly described.  Then Gersick talks at length about the political and personal challenges of the job as Director of the Yale Office on the Education of Women, in particular her interactions with feminist groups on campus and the Provost's Office. She pays tribute to a number of women in the Yale administration like Etta Onat, Betty Trachtenberg and Judy Hackman.</p>
               <p>Lastly Gersick talks about the experience of bringing up two children and the egalitarianism which she considers a hallmark of her marriage in the context of women's careers, and how these personal experiences have inspired her academic research into the culture of organizations and the challenge of changing institutional culture to enable women to flourish in the workplace.</p>

               <p>Born August 17, 1942, Florence Pat Haseltine grew up, the eldest of four children, on the China Lake Naval Base in the Mojave Desert in California, where her father was a physicist.  In 1960 she entered the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in biophysics.  She married a fellow biophysicist in their senior year and together they entered Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate school. She earned her Ph.D. in biophysics in 1969.  The marriage failed and immediately Haseltine applied to medical school.  She entered Albert Einstein School of Medicine in 1969, where she began her involvement in the women's movement.  She completed her medical studies in 1972.  Her final year was spent at the University of Pennsylvania when her second husband, Alan Chodos, a physicist whom she had married in 1970, found employment in Philadelphia.  She interned at the University of Pennsylvania, where her experiences formed the basis of her 1976 novel, <title render="italic">
                     Woman Doctor
                  </title>.  When her husband's work took them back to Boston, she undertook her Obstetrics and Gynecology residency at the Boston Hospital for Women, where she began her lifelong commitment to women's health by setting up a feminist health center.</p>
               <p>In 1976 Haseltine was hired as an Assistant Professor in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and later in 1982 as an Associate Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, where she pursued clinical research on <title render="italic">
                     in vitro
                  </title> fertilization. While at Yale, she undertook a year of training at the Yale School of Organization and Management. Having failed to be awarded tenure at Yale, she became director of the Center for Population Research at the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health.  She commuted for many years between Washington, D.C. and New Haven, CT, where her husband, who was teaching in the Yale Physics Department, and their two daughters lived.</p>
               <p>In 1990 she was a founding member of the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research, which brought the issue of women's health to the national research agenda, successfully advocating for the inclusion of women in critical clinical trials.  She has been the editor-in-chief of the <title render="italic">
                     Journal of Women's Health
                  </title> since 1992, and she edited a comprehensive report, <title render="italic">
                     Women's Health Research: a Medical and Policy Primer
                  </title> (Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research, 1997).  She has edited and authored many books and articles on reproductive medicine and women's health.  In recent years she has extended her interest to include the health of women with disabilities.  This resulted in <title render="italic">
                     Welner's Guide to the Care of Women with Disabilities
                  </title>, edited by Sandra L. Welner and Florence Haseltine (Lippincott, 2004).   Dr. Haseltine founded Haseltine Systems Corporation in 1995, a company which designs products for people with disabilities. One of her designs is the Haseltine Flyer, a portable protective container for wheelchairs to allow wheelchair users to travel more easily.  Together with Stephanie Pincus, Florence Haseltine established the RAISE Project, a national awards clearinghouse dedicated to recognizing the achievements of women in science, medicine and engineering.
 
Florence Haseltine's work on behalf of women's health research earned her a Kilby Laureate Award in 1998 and many other accolades including election to the Institute of Medicine. She was named as a Weizman Honored Scientist and a Kass Lecturer, and honored by the <title render="italic">

               <p>Florence Haseltine discusses her reasons for accepting a position at Yale, and the extent to which gender was an issue in hiring and retention of women at the Yale School of Medicine in the 1970s, a theme to which she regularly returns throughout her interview.  She discusses at length the challenges, including salary discrepancies and other forms of discrimination, and the rewards of being a woman in an almost exclusively male environment, whether in the laboratory or at Yale-New Haven Hospital.  In particular she reviews how the experience of pregnancy and motherhood impinged on her personal and professional life, and how it inspired her to lobby for daycare facilities at the medical school.  She recalls how she taught the first college seminar at Branford College on women in medicine, and pays tribute to the women scientists she encountered at Yale, speculating about what price they may have paid for their professional success.  She talks extensively about mentoring and what role gender plays in how mentoring is conducted, recollecting her own experience of "mentors and tormentors," as she describes them.  Dr Haseltine discusses gender as an issue in the 1979 Felig plagiarism case.  She talks about workplace politics in medicine and science at Yale and beyond, and the ways in which women can be excluded from executive roles, one of the reasons she took a year out to study at the Yale School of Management.  She recalls her failure to secure tenure at Yale, and her reasons for accepting a position at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) rather than seeking a tenured position at another university.  She talks extensively about her work at the NIH, especially proposals and initiatives she undertook that specifically benefited women in the sciences.  She concludes her interview by discussing the growing role of women in science and medicine, and by outlining what she believes are the institutional changes that must be made in order to achieve gender parity.</p>
               <p>Note: Florence Haseltine was also interviewed in 1977 for the Oral History Project on Women in Medicine at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, now Drexel University College of Medicine (http://archives.drexelmed.edu/womanmd).  The interview focuses on her life up to the time she was appointed at Yale.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Doan Kirk was born September 5, 1937, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Her family had strong Quaker roots and both her parents were college professors.  Her mother, Helen Bell Hole, taught English at Earlham College (1948-1970), where she was also Provost (1971-1972).    Elizabeth Kirk attended The Westtown School, and then received her B.A. from Earlham in 1959; both are Quaker foundations.    She then entered Yale as one of the members of the first wave of women graduate students in English admitted by the then Director of Graduate Studies, the medievalist, E. Talbot Donaldson, who became her doctoral supervisor.  After completing her Ph.D. in 1964, she was an Instructor in English at Yale from 1964 to 1967.   In 1967 she moved to a tenure-track position at Brown University, Providence, RI, when her husband was appointed Director of Rhode Island Historical Society, and spent the rest of her career there, becoming a full professor in 1980.</p>
               <p>Kirk held two distinguished professorships at Brown, first the Nicholas Brown Professorship of Oratory and Belles Lettres from 1989 to 1995, and then the Israel J. Kapstein Professorship in English, from 1995 until she took early retirement in 1998.     She held many administrative appointments while at Brown.  Most notably she participated in the historic settlement of <title render="italic">
                     Louise Lamphere vs. Brown University
                  </title> (1977)*, one of the most famous affirmative action cases brought against an institution of higher education in the United States.   For many years she served as the English undergraduate honors advisor, and was instrumental in designing and implementing Brown's radical "New Curriculum."  She served as Director of Graduate Studies in English, during which time she designed a graduate handbook which became a model of its kind.   She was also the first woman chair of Brown University's English Department.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Kirk's publications include <title render="italic">
                     Dream Thought of Piers Plowman
                  </title> (Yale University Press 1972) and <title render="italic">
                     Will's Vision of Piers Plowman
                  </title> (W.W. Norton, c.1990).  She edited (with Mary J. Carruthers) <title render="italic">
                     Acts of Interpretation: the Text in its Context, 700-1600
                  </title> (Pilgrim Books, 1982), essays in honor of her Yale supervisor and mentor, Talbot Donaldson.  Kirk was honored with a festscrift in 2006, with the publication of <title render="italic">
                     Mindful Spirit in Late Medieval Literature: Essays in Honor of Elizabeth D. Kirk
                  </title>, edited by Bonnie Wheeler (Palgrave, 2006).</p>
               <p>Kirk received the Harriet W. Sheridan Award for Distinguished Contribution to Teaching and Learning at Brown University in 1997.</p>
               <p>*Louise Lamphere, an assistant professor of Anthropology at Brown University, filed a class action suit alleging sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act after she was denied tenure.  In the subsequent out-of-court settlement in September 1977, Lamphere and three of her colleagues received tenure or damages, and the settlement mandated a procedure at Brown for women alleging discrimination, establishing a claims fund and an affirmative action monitoring process.  Lamphere returned to Brown in 1979.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Kirk's interview includes an extensive exploration of her Quaker upbringing and education, recollections of her powerful and academically accomplished mother, and an account of how those influences profoundly affected her experience of the academy at Yale and beyond.   She describes her first encounter with Yale culture in the late 1950s and the social, psychological and practical challenges that women graduate students and junior faculty faced.  This is placed within the context of the Yale tenure system and the effect it had in determining relationships between junior and senior faculty in the English Department.  She pays tribute to E. Talbot Donaldson's qualities as a teacher and mentor of women at Yale, especially in his role as Director of Graduate Studies. Her experience of being one of the first women fellows at Calhoun College is described, including how it differed from that of her male peers, among whom was her husband.  She talks about other women in the Yale English Department, especially her fellow medievalists, Marie Borroff and Alice "Sunny" Miskimin.  Throughout the interview she highlights specific instances and experiences, at Yale and beyond, which led her to conclude that many of the difficulties women encountered in the academy were not personal but institutional.  Her experience of combining marriage with academic life is recalled, together with the challenge of carving out independent intellectual space.</p>
               <p>Kirk describes how she obtained her position at Brown University and details the cultural differences she perceived between Yale and Brown at that time.  She talks at length about her passion for teaching and mentoring at both Yale and Brown, in particular her role as Director of Brown's Honors Program and as one of the authors who redrafted the Brown Medieval Curriculum.  She reflects on how her experiences as a Yale graduate student shaped and informed her emerging feminism, and how her growing feminist perspective influenced her work as Director of Graduate Studies at Brown.  An account is given of what she saw as gendered differences in the way that graduate students and junior faculty were treated, especially when it came to hiring and promotions.  She talks in general terms about the <title render="italic">
                     Lamphere vs. Brown University
                  </title> case, with which she was involved, and how it confirmed her view of the importance of due process and transparency to obviate what she regards as systemic inequalities in the academic profession.  From that time forward, policy issues increasingly became the major focus of her professional life at Brown.  She reflects on the challenge of attempting to maintain a balance between administration and teaching, and the personal costs of this conflict in both psychological and practical terms.  As Brown's first female chair of the English department, she considers how far her management style and practice was influenced by her gender, and the pressures which led her to take early retirement.</p>

               <p>Margaret (Maggie) Anne Mahar was born in 1949 into an Irish-American, Roman Catholic, working class family.  She was raised in Syracuse, New York.  Higher education was not a family priority, but she was one of the few in her high school who aspired to a college education.  Her parents reluctantly allowed her to apply to Middlebury College, Vermont., which admitted her.  However, when Mahar discovered that Middlebury could not provide a scholarship, she turned to a local Syracuse resident who donated the full cost of her college education.  She loved Middlebury but when she heard, in her sophomore year, that Yale University was about to admit women, she got a transfer.  Mahar graduated in 1971, one of the first cohort of co-educated women at Yale, and remained for graduate work in English, earning a Ph.D. in 1975.  In 1974 she was hired as an instructor in the English Department, and from 1975-1982 worked there as an assistant professor, during which time she married and had two children.</p>
               <p>When she was denied promotion to associate professor, Maggie Mahar left the academic profession and became a journalist, thus fulfilling her lifelong ambition to be a writer.   Since then she has been a financial journalist, contributing to <title render="italic">

               <p>Maggie Mahar talks at length about the ways in which class, race and gender intersected in her growing up, and how class, in particular, was articulated in her college years at Middlebury and Yale; she felt different from the other Yale women co-eds.  She also discusses class and gender relations among the undergraduates, and to what extent gender was an issue between faculty and students.  She recalls the events surrounding May Day, 1970, an encounter with President Kingman Brewster, and teaching freshman English as a Carnegie Fellow in her senior year.  Her attitudes to feminism and feminist issues are described; she recalls that the Yale curriculum addressed the issue of homosexuality in literature some time before feminist theory was introduced.  She talks about her reasons for choosing Yale for graduate work, the challenges she faced as a woman graduate student, her relations with other women graduate students, and her attitude to sexism and sexual harassment.  She discusses the influence of Yale scholars like Harold Bloom, Geoffrey Hartmann and J. Hillis Miller when she was a graduate student, and how their approach to literature influenced her own teaching and scholarship.  An account is given of her appointment to the English Faculty at Yale; the differences in the way male and female undergraduates responded to a woman teacher; her attitude to teaching women writers; her experience of academic administration, and departmental attitudes to pregnancy and motherhood.  A description of how the Yale tenure system worked at that time, and her own expectations, is then given, along with a lengthy review of the circumstances surrounding her denial of promotion to associate professor.  In particular she reflects on her relationship with the then acting chair of the department, Ronald Paulson.  A generational gap opened up on the faculty with the influx of younger scholars, men as well as women, from the late 60s onwards; Mahar discusses how this played out in relations between women faculty.</p>
               <p>Finally, Mahar talks about how she made the transition from academia to journalism, and her subsequent career as a financial journalist. This involves a comparison of academic culture with that of the financial world.</p>

               <p>Jacqueline Wei Mintz was born in 1935, in Shanghai, China.  Her father was in international banking and decided to move the family to the United States in 1941, shortly before the U.S. entered World War II.   The family moved around the New York area for a time before settling in Bronxville.  Mintz attended the local public school before entering Abbot Academy (now Phillips Academy).  From there she went to Radcliffe College where she majored in linguistics, with minors in Persian and Arabic.</p>
               <p>In 1958, she began a Ph.D. in linguistics at Yale.  Whilst still a graduate student she met Sidney Mintz, an anthropologist on the Yale faculty.  They married in 1964.  Mintz did not complete her doctorate but in the ensuing years, between extensive study and research periods at M.I.T., then in Iran and Paris, she held a variety of positions in the Yale administration.  First, she worked for the recently-established Carnegie funded 5-year B.A. program.   She was Dean of Saybrook College in the academic year 1971-1972, during which time she also served on Yale's Undergraduate Admissions Committee.  In 1972, she was appointed Associate Provost with responsibility for developing Yale's affirmative action program and for preparing Yale's first Affirmative Action Plan which was submitted to U.S. Department of Heath, Education and Welfare in April 1973.  She held this position until she resigned in 1976.</p>
               <p>After she left Yale, Mintz moved to Baltimore where her husband was now teaching, and took a law degree at the University of Pennsylvania.  Then she worked in Washington, D.C., first for the National Labor Relations Board, and then the American Association of University Professors.  She then specialized in consumer protection law in Baltimore, before moving to the Maryland Attorney General's Office where she worked in educational affairs until her retirement.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Jacqueline Mintz begins the interview by briefly outlining her family and educational background and touching on her ethnic identity.  A lengthy account is then given of her first impressions of Yale and the city of New Haven, and the experience of living in Helen Hadley Hall, the women graduate residence which opened its doors the year she arrived at Yale.  She describes what she perceived as the prevalent attitudes towards women at Yale, within the faculty and amongst her graduate peers and the undergraduates.  She recalls being at Yale in the sixties as a young faculty wife, and her and her husband's relations with young faculty and students, particularly their involvement with, and commitment to, the new generation of undergraduates who were  admitted to Yale as a result of the changes in admissions policy instituted under Inslee "Inky" Clark, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions, 1965-1970.  Encounters with minority student leaders like Armstead Robinson and Glenn de Chabert are detailed at length, and how the Sixties counter culture and political issues, such as civil rights and the anti-Vietnam war protests, began to change the Yale campus and relations within it.  In this context she assesses her early attitudes to feminism, the advantages and disadvantages of being a faculty wife, and how the so-called nepotism rules impinged on her life.</p>
               <p>Mintz briefly describes her involvement with the innovative 5-year B.A. program, the reasons why her husband declined an offer – a joint decision by the couple - to become the Master of Pierson College.  The circumstances in which she was offered the deanship of Saybrook College are discussed, along with the many challenges the job, especially those relating to gender and race.  She assesses to what extent her gender was an issue for the undergraduates and the college fellows.</p>
               <p>Most of the rest of her interview is taken up with her years as Associate Provost.  As Yale's first affirmative action officer she had responsibility for the development and implementation of Yale's affirmative action program.  She discusses attitudes and perceptions regarding affirmative action which then prevailed in the Yale administration and faculty, especially the intense debate surrounding the role of goals, quotas and timetables in implementing government policy, which took place against a background of stringent budgetary restraints.   A description is provided of how she approached the challenges of gathering data for, and then drafting, Yale's first Affirmative Action Plan.  She discusses relations with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare at both an institutional and personal level, singling out many specific issues, including:  the removal of the anti-nepotism rule from the Faculty Handbook, the 'pipeline' issue in respect of women and minority hiring on faculty, and the first attempts to secure regular ladder appointments for longstanding female adjunct faculty.  Mintz stresses the fact that her job entailed the development of an affirmative action program for all university employees, not just faculty, and how this responsibility brought her into contact with clerical, managerial and professional staff, and with bargaining units across the entire university.  During her tenure, she set up the first faculty search and recruitment procedures for each department and school at Yale, and completed an M &amp; P Salary and Job Classification Study (which affected over 1500 employees, many of them women).  This revealed significant wage discrepancies and other forms of discrimination.  In conclusion she discusses the reasons why she resigned in 1976, and briefly describes her professional life after she left Yale.</p>
               <p>In the course of the interview, Mintz recalls personal encounters with, and impressions of, many senior Yale figures of the period, including President Kingman Brewster, Provosts Hannah Holborn Gray and Richard Cooper, and Dean Howard Taft.  She talks about her friendship with Marnesba "Bobbi" Hill, the first African-American women to serve in the senior Yale administration (Assistant Dean of Yale College, 1973-1974 and Associate Dean, 1974-1980).  She also recalls networks of women she found useful outside Yale, and her role as a founding member, along with Bobbi Hill, of a group called New England Minority Women Administrators.</p>

               <p>Charlotte Cook Morse was born in Washington, D.C. on October 26, 1942, and was brought up in rural Loudon County, Virginia.  After graduating with a B.A. degree from Brown University in 1964 she pursued graduate studies at Stanford University where she received an M.A. in 1968 and a PH.D. in 1970.  In 1968 Morse came to Yale as an instructor in the Department of English, and from 1969-1976 served as an assistant professor.  During the period 1975-1976 she also was a program officer for the National Endowment for the Humanities in Washington, D.C. In 1976 she was appointed an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, and in 1994 promoted to full professor.  She remained at VCU until her retirement in 2011.</p>
               <p>Morse won the second national Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow Scholarship in 1960, held a Pembroke College Southern Regional Scholarship while at Brown University, received a Leverhulme Fellowship in 1967-1968, held a Morse Fellowship from Yale 1971-1972, and was twice the recipient of an NEH Fellowship, 1982 and 1991.</p>
               <p>Morse is the author of a number of books and articles on medieval literature, including <title render="italic">
                     Pattern of Judgment in the Queste and Cleanness
                  </title>  (University of Missouri Press, 1978).  In addition, she co-edited several volumes of essays in honor of the medieval scholars J.A. Burrow, V.A. Kolve and Judson Boyce Allen.   She serves on the editorial boards of <title render="italic">

               <p>Charlotte Morse talks about her upbringing and education, paying particular attention to her family history and expectations, in the context of the rural culture in which she was raised in Loudon County, Virginia.  She recalls how she came to choose Brown University for her undergraduate studies, and how she secured funding for her college education.  She outlines the gender imbalances of the National Merit Scholarships in the late 1950s, as well as her experience of winning the Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow award, which largely funded her undergraduate years at Brown. She describes the academic and social culture she encountered at Brown, including faculty attitudes to women faculty and students.  She acknowledges the intellectual inspiration and practical mentoring of the historian Harcourt Brown and the English literature scholar Barbara Lewalski (one of the few women on the Brown faculty at that time), and recalls friendships with her female student peers.  She reflects on the academic and professional aspirations of her peer group, and the restrictions relating to gender which they believed were imposed on women's careers.</p>
               <p>An account is given of why she chose Stanford University for graduate work in English, and what it was like there during the era of civil rights and opposition to the Vietnam war.  She discusses the challenge of combining marriage with the academic life, a subject which is a running theme throughout the interview.  Morse recounts her experience of the academic job market of the late 1960s, the kinds of discrimination facing women, and the circumstances of her appointment at Yale.  She speculates as to why Yale's English Department appointed so many women to junior faculty positions at that time.  A lengthy description is provided of the culture then prevailing in the Yale English Department and the wider Yale community, particularly life in Morse College and the ways in which Yale changed socially and culturally during the late 60s.  Morse originally iterated the challenges of being an academic woman in a written submission to the Greene Committee on the Status of Professional Women at Yale (1971). These issues are revisited in her interview, especially sexual harassment and the complexities of combining work and marriage.  She also addresses the difficulties of the Yale tenure system and the lack of formal mentoring for both male and female junior faculty, and how far gender complicated these matters.  Many of the senior English faculty, including Maynard Mack, Thomas Greene, Martin Price, W.K. Wimsatt, Frederick Robinson and Bart Giamatti, are recalled.  Morse pays special tribute to Marie Borroff, who was then the only tenured woman in the English Department.</p>
               <p>Her appointment to Yale coincided with the arrival of the first women undergraduates; she reminisces about them and some of the challenges they faced. Morse also recalls the events surrounding May Day, 1970, and her encounter with some of the early feminist groups at Yale around this time.  She summarizes the general indifference to, or ignorance of, women's issues in the English Department until the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare equal rights regulations were passed in 1972.  In particular she remembers a conversation with Bart Giamatti in which they discussed how these changes in the federal law would affect Yale.</p>
               <p>Morse recounts how the oil crisis of 1974 and the subsequent recession affected university recruitment, and what this meant in her own life as she went onto a retrenched job market in search of a tenure-track position, whilst dealing with the crisis of her failing marriage.</p>
               <p>Finally she talks about the legacy of Yale, how it influenced her subsequent teaching and scholarship, and pays tribute to the medievalists who nurtured her scholarship and intellectual life, in particular the British scholars Eric Stanley and John Burrow (both of whom held visiting appointments at Yale).</p>

               <p>Rolly Phillips was born March 31, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York.  Brought up in Pocatello, Idaho, she is the eldest of six children.  Her mother was the first woman to graduate from the University of Idaho Law School and was a practicing lawyer all her life.  Phillips gained her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College in 1965.  She then spent two years as a Fulbright Scholar at Newnham College, Cambridge, England.  She earned a Ph.D. in classics from Harvard in 1970.   After teaching summer school at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, she was hired by Yale as an Instructor in Classics in the fall of 1970.  At that time there was only one other woman in the department, a lecturer, Anne Parry, wife of then Chair, Adam Milman Parry. From 1971-1977, Rolly Phillips was an Assistant Professor in Classics.  Knowing that she was unlikely to get tenure, she left Yale and taught for almost three years at Barnard College, New York.  She then decided not to continue a career in higher education and obtained a position teaching classics at Fieldston School, New York, where she still teaches.</p>

               <p>Mary Lake Polan was born July 17, 1943, in Las Vegas, New Mexico and grew up in Huntington, West Virginia.  The eldest of four children, her father was an ophthalmologist, her mother a housewife.  After early schooling in Huntington, her high school years were spent at the Emma Willard School in Troy, New York.  She graduated from Connecticut College in 1965, <title render="italic">
                     cum laude
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Phi Beta Kappa
                  </title>, having also completed a Smith College Junior Year Abroad in Paris 1963-1964.  Polan enrolled in Yale University in 1965 as a graduate student in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (M.B.B.), earning her Ph.D. in 1970.  From 1970 to 1972 she was an Instructor and Lecturer in M.B.B. as well as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr Joseph Gall, in the Yale Department of Biology, the second year of which was funded by a National Institutes of Health Postdoctoral Fellowship.</p>
               <p>Professor Polan entered Yale University School of Medicine in 1972, gaining her M.D. in 1975.  She spent several months of her medical training at Oxford Medical School, Oxford University, England, as a Clinical Clerk in Obstetrics and Gynecology and in Pediatrics at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.  From 1975-1978 she was a Resident in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, the first woman ever to complete a residency in that department.  In early 1978 she spent several months as an Instructor in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Pahlavi University, Shiraz, Iran, followed by a similar appointment at Yale.   After her residency she held two fellowships in the Yale Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the first in Oncology and the second in Endocrinology and Infertility, during which time Polan had the first of her three children.</p>
               <p>From 1981-1985 Polan was an Assistant Professor in the Yale Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, then Associate Professor 1985-1990.  In 1986 she was a visiting professor at Hunan Medical College, China.  Polan left Yale in 1990 to become the Katharine Dexter McCormick and Stanley McCormick Memorial Professor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine, where she was also Chair from 1990 to 2005.  Polan retired in 2005 but continued to practice, including a visiting professorship in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, at Columbia University School of Medicine.</p>
               <p>Professor Polan served on the boards of numerous medical boards and corporations including Wyeth, DuPont and Proctor &amp; Gamble.  She was a founding member of the Board of Directors of the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health Research; served on the Board of Directors, New York Academy of Medicine; and as a Trustee of Connecticut College.  She held many positions at the Institute of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, and in such professional societies as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. She authored <title render="italic">

               <p>Mary Lake Polan discusses her upbringing and education.  She reflects on the ways in which her parents encouraged her to be independent and self-reliant, and how the all-girl Emma Willard School cultivated intellectual self-confidence, qualities which Polan believes enabled her to flourish in a scientific and medical environment.  She talks at some length about her application to the Yale Biochemistry Graduate program and the experience of being a graduate student at Yale.  She recalls her time living in the graduate women's college, Helen Hadley Hall, and in particular her experience as a resident fellow at Timothy Dwight College.  She describes how women were excluded from Mory's and the Elizabethan Club.  Particular tribute is paid to Dr. Joseph G. Gall, a pioneer in the field of cell biology, as an advisor and mentor.  She recalls what it was like to be one of "Gall's Gals," the soubriquet given to the women graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who worked in Gall's laboratory.  It was one of the few places at Yale in the late 1960s and early 1970s where women far outnumbered men.   These women, whom Mary Polan acknowledges at some length,  included Joan Steitz, Mary Clutter, Susan Gerbi, Virginia Walbot and Mary Lou Pardue, all of whom went on to have distinguished careers.  Polan discusses how the postwar expansion of scientific education and the development of new areas of research in the United States benefited women.  She recalls the establishment of Women in Cell Biology in 1971, believed to be the first such women's group in the American scientific community. Nevertheless she recalls that, despite growing opportunities for women in science, including new openings at Yale and other universities, many well qualified women remained at instructor or lecturer level.</p>
               <p>Polan contrasts her experiences as a science graduate with those as a medical student, and discusses what she perceives to be the very significant differences between science and medical education and culture, and why medicine was particularly difficult for women to negotiate.  She talks at length about being the only female resident in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Yale School of Medicine and speculates on the extent to which difficulties for women in medicine were a result of gender or due to the hierarchical nature of medical training.  She recalls her experience on the faculty at Yale Medical School, including relationships with colleagues, mentoring, salary inequities, and the challenge of managing a career, marriage and children.  She explains why she left Yale and how her Yale experiences influenced her managerial style and vision as Chair of Stanford's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  She concludes by considering how medical culture has changed as a result of the increasing numbers of women entering the profession.</p>

               <p>Maureen Quilligan briefly discusses her upbringing but talks at length about her intellectually and politically formative student years at U.C. Berkeley during the 1960s.  She discusses the reasons she chose Harvard for her doctoral studies, her involvement in Harvard's Graduate Women's Organization, and pays tribute to the medievalist Morton Bloomfield, her supervisor, for his mentorship and sensitivities to gender issues.  She details the circumstances surrounding her appointment at Yale, the excitement and challenges of her first job, and how she first began to focus on gender in her teaching and scholarship.  Gender relations within the Yale Department of English are discussed extensively, particularly how they reflected departmental and institutional culture.  She talks about the junior/senior faculty divide at Yale, the university's tenure process and how she responded to the competitive pressures of its intellectual community. An account is given of the first conference held at Yale in 1982 on gender in the Renaissance, organized by Nancy Vickers, Maureen Quilligan and her Yale colleague, Margaret Ferguson, and its impact on Renaissance studies at Yale and beyond. She recalls women in the English Department, including Marie Borroff, who was its first tenured woman and Patricia Spacks who was the first female Chair of the department, and reflects at length on the difficulties, including her own, of being a woman in academia.  Quilligan also talks about the challenges of teaching at Yale in the 1970s, especially the challenge of shaping and implementing protocols in the newly coeducational environment.   She speaks of her involvement at Yale in the campaign for affirmative action and the establishment of Women's Studies and, more generally, working at an institutional level to introduce gender into the curriculum and its importance as a catalyst to institutional change.  She also comments on specific documents in the Yale University Archives to which she contributed during her time at Yale.  The interview concludes with her thoughts on the current position of women in the academy, particularly in the context of the so-called "culture wars," and the role of the humanities in the public sphere.</p>

               <p>H. Catherine W. Skinner was born in Brooklyn, New York, on January 25, 1931.  She took her B.A. at Mount Holyoke College in 1952, followed by an M.A. from Radcliffe College in 1954.  She met and married her husband, Brian Skinner, when they were both graduate students and thereafter her career followed his.  While he was completing his Harvard Ph.D., she worked as a crystallographer at Harvard Medical School, 1954-1955.  The Skinners moved to Australia when he was appointed to a position at the University of Adelaide.  She gained her Ph.D. in mineralogy there in 1959. Brian Skinner's appointment at the United States Geological Survey in 1958 prompted their return to this country. With three small children, Catherine Skinner worked as a mineralogist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, at the National Institutes of Health, 1961-1964, and then at the National Institute of Dental Research 1965-1966.  In 1966, Brian Skinner's appointment as Professor of Geology brought them to Yale University.  Catherine Skinner has held a number of faculty positions at Yale, including Research Associate, Department of Surgery, 1967-1972; Senior Research Associate, Department of Surgery, 1972-1975; and Associate Professor of Biochemistry in Surgery, 1978-1984; as well as a variety of lectureships and affiliated positions since 1967 in the departments of Biology, Geology, Orthopedic Surgery and the Peabody Museum.  She was made a Senior Research Scientist in Geology in 2006 at the age of 75.</p>
               <p>During 1977-1983, Catherine Skinner was the first woman Master of Jonathan Edwards College and during 1985-1994, served as the first female President of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.  She has held a number of visiting professorships at the universities of Harvard, Cornell, Wyoming, Adelaide and Stanford.  She was made a Fellow of the Geological Society of America (1989) and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993).  In addition she has chaired national committees at the National Academy of Science, the Geological Society of America and the National Research Council, as well as chairing or serving on many committees at Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital.  She has written over 70 scientific papers on geology and health, and written or edited four books including <title render="italic">

               <p>Catherine Skinner talks about her family background and influences and the social expectations of young women in postwar America.  She reflects extensively on her social and intellectual experiences at Mount Holyoke and Radcliffe colleges, and more generally on the importance of women's colleges as empowering intellectual communities for women of her generation. She recalls how and why newer scientific fields like molecular biology and environmental science have provided opportunities for women determined to pursue scientific careers in ways that the more traditional disciplines, like her own chosen field of geology, did not.  Throughout the interview she talks about scientists, mostly male, who helped her carve out a career in academic science, and the personal qualities and social support systems she believes helped her to succeed.   She reflects on the challenges she encountered in balancing marriage and family with a career, and how she negotiated the experience of often being the only woman in a man's world (as she describes it).  She describes in detail how she found, and retained, employment as a scientist at Yale University, at a time when spousal hire was not an option, and addresses issues of status and salary in respect to women in the scientific community.   A major part of the interview is devoted to Dr. Skinner's life as a College Master.  She speculates on why she was offered the job, and the challenges it brought, especially during the 1977 Yale strike, and the effect it had on her family life.  She also talks about the early years of co-education at Yale and how it and affirmative action changed the social and intellectual life of the university.</p>

               <p>Patricia Spacks talks about her background and upbringing, in particular her relationship with her father set within the context of expectations for young women of the period.  She gives a lively account of the different intellectual, social and emotional challenges of her student years at Rollins College, Yale University, and the University of California at Berkeley.  She recalls those teachers, like Bertrand Bronson at Berkeley, who encouraged her intellectual development.  Throughout the interview Spacks describes the pleasures and challenges of teaching in both mixed and single-sex environments.  She recounts her experiences as a young mother when she was teaching at the University of Florida and Wellesley College.  Spacks details her awakening to feminism and in particular how she came to write <title render="italic">
                     The Female Imagination
                  </title>.  Her experience of Yale culture, especially in the context of being the first female Chair of the Department of English, is described at length, along with the ways in which she believes her gender influenced both how she was expected to do the job and how she actually did it.  The challenges of chairing the English Department, the difficulties of the tenure system for both male and female junior faculty, and the best means of nurturing women (particularly women graduate students) at that time are all addressed. Spacks explains why she left Yale and what she brought from her Yale experience to her work at the University of Virginia.  In the last part of the interview she reflects on her work as president of the Modern Languages Association and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the challenges of being a public intellectual and defender of the humanities in contemporary America, and the future of the academic profession and the position of women within it.</p>

               <p>Betty Glassman Trachtenberg was born in 1933 and brought up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Her parents were Russian Jewish immigrants.  In 1952, aged 19, she married Alan Trachtenberg, whose family lived in the same neighborhood.  A talented pianist, she earned a Bachelor of Music from Ornstein School of Music in Philadelphia.  In 1955 she had her first child, during the period when her husband was studying for a master's degree at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. Two more children followed in quick succession.  From Storrs the family moved to Minneapolis for Alan Trachtenberg's Ph.D.   During this time Trachtenberg taught music and was active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.  Alan Trachtenberg got his first faculty position at Pennsylvania State University at State College, PA; during their time there Betty Trachtenberg and a neighbor established a music academy.  Following a year at Stanford University the Trachtenbergs came to Yale in 1969, when Alan Trachtenberg was appointed to a position in English and American Studies.  For an initial period of three years she worked in New Haven teaching music to emotionally disturbed children, but after a year's sabbatical in London, UK, where she took a course at the Anna Freud Institute, Trachtenberg decided on a change of direction.</p>
               <p>Trachtenberg began her career at Yale in 1974 in the Summer Term Office.  She then became assistant director in the Undergraduate Admissions Office, where she was the first director of admissions for the Eli Whitney Students Program, which oversees students of non-traditional age and background.  Later she spent three years as associate director of Yale Summer Programs, before joining the Yale College Dean's Office (in 1984) as director of freshman affairs. In this position she was responsible for the freshman counselor and orientation programs. Trachtenberg retained this program portfolio when she became Dean of Student Affairs in 1987, the first woman to hold the position and one which she held for twenty years until her retirement in 2007.  As Dean of Student Affairs she had a wide range of responsibilities, which included setting policies in student health and social conduct, participating in disciplinary, mediation and grievance procedures (including sexual harassment), encouraging student participation in university governance, overseeing student organizations, and advocating on behalf of Yale Women's Center. One of her many achievements as Dean was the founding of the ethnic counseling program.  She was popularly known to Yale's undergraduates as the Dean of Sex, Drugs, and Rock-and-Roll.</p>

               <p>Betty Trachtenberg describes growing up in an extended Jewish family in Philadelphia, recalling the culture of a largely immigrant community and her own involvement in leftist politics during her teenage years.   She speaks at length about being a young wife and mother in the 1950s, and being one of a group of young married women who were determined to maintain their own interests alongside having children and supporting their husbands through graduate school.  She considers the extent to which she absorbed contemporary cultural assumptions about women's role in society.  Her first impressions of Yale are described, together with the social challenges of being a young faculty wife and encounters with the wives of senior faculty.  An account is given of how she got her first job in the Yale administration, the kinds of students who were admitted to the Eli Whitney Students Program in its early days, and the problems they faced (particularly the women). Trachtenberg then explains her reasons for standing down as director of summer programs and how her move to the Yale College Dean's Office came about.  The challenges of the job of Director of Freshman Affairs, and the changes she made during her tenure, are outlined.  She talks about her relationships with Judith Brandenburg, an associate dean of Yale College, and Patricia (Prish) Pierce. The bulk of the interview deals with Trachtenberg's twenty years as Dean of Student Affairs.  Amongst the topics she discusses are her work with the Women's Center and the mentorship of Yale administrators like Lloyd Suttle and Martin Griffin.  She also pays tribute to the collegiality and guidance of women such as Elga Wasserman, Etta Onat, Judith Brandenburg, Lorraine Siggins and Mary Arnstein. The extent to which issues of gender, as opposed to those of seniority, might be perceived as an exclusionary mechanism in the politics of Yale's administration is addressed.  She recalls some of the major challenges in working with undergraduates, especially in respect of disciplinary issues relating to alcohol and sexual harassment.  A lengthy consideration is offered of the work of Yale's Sexual Harassment Grievance Board, and her involvement in the creation of the Sexual Harassment and Assault Resource and Education Center [S.H.A.R.E.], concluding with an account of how the treatment of such matters has evolved at Yale.</p>

               <p>Elga Ruth Wasserman was born Elga Steinherz in 1925 into a middle class Jewish family, in Berlin, Germany.  She came to the United States at the age of twelve with her parents and younger brother to escape Hitler, and the family settled in Great Neck, Long Island.  She excelled in high school, and won a scholarship to Smith College, from which she graduated with a B.A. <title render="italic">
                     summa cum laude
                  </title> in 1945.  She considered a medical career but, for financial and personal reasons, she opted instead to do a Ph.D. in Chemistry at Radcliffe College, supervised by Nobel Prize winner Robert Burns Woodward. She graduated in 1948.   She was, almost certainly, Woodward's one and only female doctoral student.  She married fellow Woodward student, Harry Wasserman, in 1947.  The Wassermans moved to Yale in 1948 when Harry Wasserman joined the Chemistry department as an instructor.  She found a position at Yale as a research assistant in Microbiology but resigned voluntarily shortly before the birth of her first child.  For the next twelve years she raised three children, supplementing the family income with part-time jobs as a chemist in industry and teaching at local community colleges.  Once her third child was in school, she returned briefly in 1960-1961 to chemistry research at Yale, but in 1962 she accepted the position of assistant to the Dean of Yale Graduate School.  She discovered that administration enabled her to be both professionally independent and to work part-time, so in 1964 she accepted the position of Assistant Dean at the Graduate School, with special responsibility for graduate science programs, a post she held until February 1969.  Yale's decision in the fall of 1968 to admit women undergraduates led President Kingman Brewster to seek out Dr. Wasserman to oversee the implementation of co-education at the University.  She was appointed chair of the University Committee on Coeducation before becoming Brewster's Special Assistant on the Education of Women, a post she held from 1969 to 1973, by which time Yale's transition to coeducation was complete.  She felt it was then time to move on.  Her experience with equal access issues at Yale resulted in <title render="italic">

                  </title>, published by Praeger in 1975, and inspired her to become a lawyer.  She graduated from Yale Law School in 1976.  She spent the next twenty years, until her retirement, in private practice, first as a tax lawyer but subsequently as a family lawyer.</p>
               <p>In retirement, reflecting on her own experience as a scientist and administrator, Elga Wasserman began to address the question of why there are not more women in science.  Her conclusions were published as <title render="italic">

               <p>Elga Wasserman briefly recalls her early childhood in Nazi Germany and her first impressions of the United States.  She reflects about the educational and social expectations of women in her family and in society at large in postwar America, speaking at some length about the ambivalences she encountered in college and graduate school towards women in higher education, especially in science.  Throughout the interview she engages with the reasons why, in her view, women were, and continue to be, at a disadvantage in academic life, and the ways in which equity balance in academia might be achieved.  She discusses the relationship between individual choices and structural change, and addresses tenure, salary, promotion and retention, and reflects on the significance of affirmative action and the opportunities it presented to women in the 1970s.  She speculates at some length on why combining a professional career with motherhood appears, in her view, to be more difficult in the United States than other parts of the world.</p>
               <p>The bulk of Wasserman's interview deals with her career at Yale, including her experience as an Assistant Dean in the Graduate School, her work on the Coeducation Committee and her role as Special Assistant on the Education of Women to President Kingman Brewster.  She talks at length about the reasons why she choose to work part-time when her children were small, and recalls the challenges faced by women scientists like Mary Ingraham Bunting (who she knew as a colleague at Yale) who combined full-time scientific research with motherhood.  She talks about the difficulties she experienced as a faculty wife within the prevailing culture at Yale in the 1950s and the persistence of gender discrimination at Yale institutions like the Yale Club of New York and Mory's until the 1970s.  She also recalls her relationships with senior Yale figures including John Perry Miller, John Wilkinson, Georges May, Henry "Sam" Chauncey, Jr., George Pierson, Alfred Fitt, Hannah Gray, Bart Giamatti and Kingman Brewster.  Lastly, she devotes much time to the challenges and difficulties she experienced in her job overseeing coeducation and negotiating affirmative action within the university, and details the reasons she decided in the end to leave Yale to pursue a new career in the law.</p>

               <p>Marjorie G. Wynne was born March 7, 1917, in Petersburg, Virginia.  Her father died in the influenza pandemic of 1918, which obliged her mother to seek work as a secretary and eventually to open a nursery school and kindergarten.  Despite the financial struggle, acerbated by the Great Depression, it was always assumed that Wynne would go to college.  She graduated from Duke University in 1938 but, for financial reasons, did not consider graduate school. Instead, she worked for two years in the Duke Library to save enough money to go to library school, which she attended at the University at California, Berkeley, graduating with a Certificate in Librarianship in 1941.  Remaining for a Master's degree was a financial impossibility.  Instead, she worked briefly at the Pennsylvania Military College in Chester, Pennsylvania, before joining the staff of the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University in 1942, initially as Serial Cataloguer and then Assistant in the Rare Book Room. From 1947 to 1963 she was Librarian of the Rare Book Room.  With the opening of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1963, she was appointed as the Edwin J. Beinecke Research Librarian, a position she held until her retirement in 1987.  In 1968 she became one of the first non-faculty women to be elected a fellow of Timothy Dwight College.</p>
               <p>Wynne has written many articles on bibliography, including a contribution to <title render="italic">
                     Rare Book Collections: Some Theoretical and Practical Suggestions for Use by Librarians and Students
                  </title> (American Library Association, 1965) and a guide to the J.M. Barrie collection in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.  She curated several exhibitions at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and her published exhibition catalogs include <title render="italic">
                     James Joyce, 1882-1942
                  </title> (1982) and <title render="italic">
                     F.T. Marinetti and Futurism
                  </title> (1983).</p>
               <p>After retiring, Wynne remained active in her discipline and is a member of the Grolier Club, the Association Internationale de Bibliophilie, and Yale's Elizabethan Club.  She was one of the first women to be admitted to the Grolier Club in 1976 when it was opened to women for the first time.  She has served as Secretary of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences and as President of the New Haven branch of the English-Speaking Union.  Her portrait, commissioned by the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and painted by Irene Hecht, was unveiled in 2006.  In the same year, she established the Marjorie G. Wynne fellowship in British Literature, which provides funds for visiting scholars at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</p>
               <p>Marjorie G. Wynne, who spent 45 years as a rare book librarian at Yale University, died on Sunday evening, April 5, 2009, in her home at Whitney Center in Hamden, Conn. She was 92 years old.</p>

               <p>Marjorie G. Wynne discusses her southern upbringing during the Great Depression and how this affected her subsequent life decisions.  She recalls briefly her undergraduate education at Duke University and speaks extensively about her professional training and social life at the University of California, Berkeley, Library School and the support and encouragement she received from people like Edith Coulter and Richard Archer.  The bulk of her interview is concerned with her long career at Yale University.  She recalls her first impressions of the Sterling Memorial Library and why she chose Yale over a better paid position at Brown University.  She reflects at length on her work as Librarian of the Rare Book Room.  She recalls the library as one of the few places at Yale where women were highly visible, and discusses both the opportunities and limitations that women of her generation encountered there.  She talks about several of the senior women, including Emily Hall and Grace Fuller, and their roles in the day-to-day operation of the library.  She provides many personal anecdotes about University Librarians, James Tinkham Babb and Bernhard Knollenberg, and Chauncey Brewster Tinker, Librarian of the Rare Books Room.  She also discusses relationships between library staff and faculty and her own involvement with the Yale Dramatic Association and Timothy Dwight College.   Wynne recalls the building of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and the circumstances surrounding her appointment as the Edwin J. Beinecke Research Librarian.   She talks about her encounters with Edwin Beinecke and her enduring friendship with Donald Gallup, the book collector and bibliographer.  Her interview ends with discussion of her major retirement project (which was the refurbishment of the Elizabethan Club in 1996), her continuing involvement in rare book librarianship, and the painting of her portrait for the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 2006.</p>
