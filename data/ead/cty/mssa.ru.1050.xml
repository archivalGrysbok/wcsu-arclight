         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The Medieval studies program began at Yale in 1962. At first, Medieval Studies was an M.A. program. It became a Ph.D. program in 1965. An M.Phil. program was added in 1999.</p>
         <p>The faculty is drawn from many relevant humanities departments -- Classics, Comparative Literature, English, French, German, History, History of Art, Italian, Music, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Slavic Languages and Literatures, and Spanish and Portuguese -- and of the Divinity School, the Beinecke Library, and the Yale Institute of Sacred Music. There are some forty faculty members at Yale who work on the various cultures of the Middle Ages. They form one of the largest assemblies of specialized medievalists in any university of the United States.</p>
         <p>The Program offers each term a special interdisciplinary seminar in Medieval Studies, the topic of which varies from term to term. The program sponsors lectures, colloquia, and special events throughout the academic year. The Yale Lectures in Medieval Studies bring truly outstanding medievalists to campus. The weekly Medieval Lunch Colloquium provides a low-key atmosphere in which graduate students and faculty discuss work in progress over college dining hall lunch fare.</p>
