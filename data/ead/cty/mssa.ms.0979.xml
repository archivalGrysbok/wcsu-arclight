         <p>George Washington Lyon.</p>
         <p>He was born in New York City, Oct. 14, 1828. In the fall of 1851 was elected to the New York Assembly by a large majority, served one term with credit to himself and his constituency, but thereafter withdrew from politics, political life not suiting his tastes.</p>
         <p>He acted as best man at the wedding of his intimate friend, Mr. J. H. Bates, at Kalamazoo, and there formed the acquaintance of Miss Abby L. Duncan, a sister of Mr. Bates's bride, a handsome and accomplished young lady, whom he afterward married.</p>
         <p>He studied medicine, graduated at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and practised his profession in New York City for a few years before settling in Kalamazoo, Mich.</p>
         <p>He died at Kalamazoo, Mich., on Tuesday, Nov. 23, 1875.</p>
         <p>The following appeared in a Kalamazoo (Mich.) newspaper of Nov. 23, 1875:--</p>
         <p>"George W. Lyon, one of our leading physicians, and a resident here of over fifteen years, died this morning at about half-past nine o'clock, of consumption of the bowels. Dr. Lyon has been ill for several months, and but little hope has been entertained of his recovery. His mind was clear, and he appeared to be aware of his immediate dissolution, for he silently took his wife's hand, and pressed it to his lips, and looked into her face a good-bye he could not utter. He became unconscious after that, and died without the least apparent pain. Mrs. Lyon, Mrs. James Taylor, Mrs. And Mr. Charles R. Bates, and Dr. Porter were with him when he died. Dr. Lyon was about fifty years of age, and has been one of our best-known citizens for many years, a gentleman of unusual culture even for these days, and a physician who was at the head of his profession. A host of friends here and elsewhere will mourn his loss. He leaves a wife but no children."</p>

               <p>The papers of George Washington Lyon consist of fourteen medical notebooks, 1854-1858. Thirteen of them appear to contain lecture notes, 1854-1856, presumably taken during his student days at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. The fourteenth, which has one page dated 1858, appears to contain lists of patients.</p>
               <p>The provenance of these papers is unknown.</p>
