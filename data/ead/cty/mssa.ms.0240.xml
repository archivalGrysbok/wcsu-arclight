         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Gilman Family Papers consists of correspondence, diaries, writings, accountbooks, photographs, and newsclippings relating to the Gilman and Coit families, from the early eighteenth century to the first half of the twentieth century. In addition to the materials relating to the Gilman, Coit, and Bristol families, there are materials pertaining to some of the most prominent New England families, including the Trumbulls and Sillimans, with whom the Gilmans were related by marriage. There is also material pertaining to the history of Norwich, Connecticut. Most important is the correspondence and writings of Edward Whiting Gilman, brother of Daniel Coit Gilman (see Daniel Coit Gilman Collection, Yale University), who was a prominent clergyman in the Congregational Church and, from 1871 to 1900, the foreign secretary of the American Bible Society.</p>
         <p>Edward Gilman of Norfolk, England, was the first of the Gilman family to emigrate to America, settling in Hingham, Massachusetts in 1638. Members of the family branched out through New England, settling in Exeter, New Hampshire and Norwich, Connecticut. William Charles Gilman moved to the latter town in 1816 and married Elizabeth Coit (1820), a descendant of one of the founders of Norwich. He became a partner in several business ventures, notably the Norwich Water Company, but due to the panic of 1837 suffered a series of financial reverses, causing him to move his family to New York City, where he died in 1844.</p>
         <p>Edward Whiting Gilman, the oldest son of William Charles Gilman, was born in Norwich in 1823. He entered Yale College in 1839, and was graduated in 1843. In the autumn of that year he went to West Point, New York where he spent a year as an instructor in Professor Kinsley's school for boys. In November, 1844, he moved to New York City where he was engaged for several years as a teacher in private schools while attending lectures at Union Theological Seminary. In 1847 he accepted a tutorship at Yale College, a position he held for two years, while he attended lectures at the Seminary. In 1849 Gilman was ordained minister of the Congregational Church in Lockport, New York, serving from 1849 to 1856. This was followed by charges in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1856-1858), Bangor, Maine (1858-1863), and Stonington, Connecticut (1864-1871). In 1871 he accepted the position as foreign secretary of the American Bible Society where he remained until his death in 1900. In this capacity he made ex tensive trips to Europe and Mexico carrying on a lively correspondence with members of his family, especially his daughter, Caroline T. Gilman, pertaining to his experiences and observations.</p>
         <p>The Gilman Family Papers are divided into four series: I. Correspondence; II. Coit Family; III. Diaries, Writings, Financial and Personal Papers of Gilman Family Members; and IV. Subject File.</p>
         <p>CORRESPONDENCE, the greatest part of which is that of Edward Whiting Gilman, is arranged chronologically. It is preceded, however, by a selected list of important correspondents and includes a number of names prominent in nineteenth century education, politics, and religion. Among those listed are: Lyman Abbot, Leonard Bacon, Leonard Woolsey Bacon, James Bryce, Lewis Cass, Charles Anderson Dana, James Dwight Dana, Jeremiah Day, Timothy Dwight, John Charles Fremont, Arnold Guyot, Theodore T. Munger, James Ford Rhodes, Josiah Royce, William Henry Seward, Theodore Dwight Woolsey, and Benjamin Silliman, both father and son.</p>
         <p>Series two, COIT FAMILY, consists of the papers of the Coit family and spans the years from 1659 to 1886. John Coit, the first member of the family to leave England for the colonies, arrived in Saybrook, Connecticut in 1630. In the course of the seventeenth century, members of the family settled in New London, Connecticut and finally in Norwich, Connecticut, where William Charles Gilman settled and married Elizabeth Coit on May 2, 1820. A majority of the series consists of correspondence, primarily that of Martha Coit to her mother, Mehetabel Chandler Coit, and to her sister, Elizabeth Gardiner. There is also considerable correspondence between Joshua Coit and his sister, Maria Coit Perit, and his father Daniel Lathrop Coit. A small group of diaries, biographical and genealogical materials, and memorabilia is filed at the end of the series.</p>
         <p>Series III, DIARIES, WRITINGS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL PAPERS OF GILMAN FAMILY MEMBERS, consists primarily of personal and family materials, including diaries and account books, photos, scrapbooks, and memorabilia. There are, however, some writings, especially those of Edward Whiting Gilman, which relate to his studies at Yale College (1840-1843), his travels in Mexico (1878-1879), his travels in Europe (1880-1843), and a book he wrote while teaching in West Point, New York entitled, <title render="italic">
               A Guide to West Point
            </title> (1844). In addition, there are a number of articles written by Gilman while serving as foreign secretary of the American Bible Society from 1871 to 1900. The series also includes several diaries written by Gilman's daughter, Caroline, a journal containing family records (1874), and another on the family estate, "Coit Elms." Two journals kept by William Charles Gilman record his excursions in Pennsylvania in 1834 and the White Mountains in 1850. There is also a sketch of the Gilman family by Julia S. (Bristol) Gilman and a diary she kept while travelling in Europe in 1888 and again in 1926.</p>
         <p>Series IV, SUBJECTS FILE, contains correspondence, photos, newsclippings, and an assortment of printed and manuscript materials pertaining to the following subjects:</p>

               <p>This series contains the diaries, writings, account books and financial records, genealogical materials, clippings, photographs, and memorabilia of a dozen Gilman family members. The series is divided into two subsections: "Gilman Family, General," and "Gilman Family, Individual Members."</p>
               <p>"Gilman Family, General" contains genealogical materials about Gilman and related families, photos, account books and financial papers, scrapbooks, and memorabilia which cannot be attributed to an individual family member. This section is arranged alphabetically by title or subject category.</p>
               <p>"Gilman Family, Individual Members" is arranged alphabetically by the name of the individual family member. Materials are filed under a given family member's name in the following order: diaries and calendar books, journals and memoirs; personal finances and account books; genealogical material; writings, both manuscript and printed, including articles, essays, books speeches, and sermons; miscellaneous notes; newspaper clippings and printed matter; and memorabilia, including scrapbooks and photos. It should be noted, however, that not all family members will have materials in each of these categories.</p>
