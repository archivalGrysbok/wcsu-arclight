         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Bostwick Family Papers consist of approximately 213 letters to William Lewis Bostwick, 1845-1858, all but three dating from the period during which he was a student first at Jubilee College, Illinois, and then at Trinity College, Connecticut. Bostwick's correspondents are mainly friends and teachers from Jubilee College and members of his family, including among them his sisters Celeste (Bostwick) Fuller of Flushing, New York, and Mary (Bostwick) Harriman of Litchfield, Connecticut; his uncles A. S. and William H. Lewis, Henry H. Bostwick, and Daniel E. Brown; and members of the Hanford family of Lockport, Illinois. Comstock Hanford was Bostwick's guardian. The letters from friends deal largely with events at Jubilee College (one friend writes of being unjustly expelled for intoxication, 1850 Aug 18; another describes the funeral of Bishop Philander Chase, founder of the College, 1852 Oct 18), with church matters, and with Bostwick's decision to study theology at Trinity College. The family letters deal with social events and family news and business, in particular details of paying for Bostwick's education out of the estates of his parents and grandmother. A letter from Bishop George Burgess, 1852 Jul 10, offers Bostwick a scholarship to divinity school.</p>

         <p>William Lewis Bostwick was born in Hammondsport, New York, on December 20, 1830. He studied for four years at Jubilee College in Illinois, but graduated from Trinity College in Connecticut in 1851. Immediately, he joined the theological faculty at Trinity and was ordained into the priesthood in 1855. He returned to Illinois for missionary work, but later returned to Connecticut to lead parishes in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties. He died in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 13, 1895.</p>
