         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The majority of the William Dowdell Denson Papers relate to the four war crimes trials in which Denson served as chief prosecutor. The Denson papers do not contain a significant amount of information about Denson's personal life. Transcripts of the war crimes trials duplicate materials held at the National Archives and therefore, the more interesting materials are the notebooks, correspondence, and photographs from the trials.</p>
         <p>Author Joshua Greene used the Denson Papers in researching his book, <title render="italic">
               Justice at Dachau: The Trials of An American Prosecutor,
            </title> prior to their arrival in Manuscripts and Archives. In Series, I, II, and III, there are folders of materials collected by Greene, identified as such, for his research on Denson and the trials. There may also be materials, obtained by Greene, in other folders throughout the collection.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>William Dowdell Denson was born into an old Southern family on May 31, 1913. His father was an established lawyer and politician in Birmingham, Alabama, where William Dowdell was born. His maternal grandfather had been on the Alabama Supreme Court and his great-grandfather was a colonel in the Confederate Army.</p>
         <p>At his father's encouragement, Denson attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated <emph render="italic">cum laude</emph> in 1934 with the degree of B.S. and was given a commission as second lieutenant in the Field Artillery of the United States Army. Denson resigned his commission in order to enter Harvard Law School and received the degree of LL.B. in 1937.</p>
         <p>After law school, Denson returned to Birmingham, Alabama, to practice law with his father. He passed the bar examination for the state of Alabama in August 1937 and was admitted to that bar in October. He was admitted to practice in all of the Federal District Courts of Alabama in January 1938, and in October 1939, to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Between 1937 and 1942, he tried over three hundred cases.</p>
         <p>In 1942, he was called to be captain in the United States Army. His assignment was to be an instructor in the department of law at West Point, where he taught a course in military justice. Denson was sent overseas in March 1945 to the Judge Advocate General's Department, Third United States Army. In September 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.</p>
         <p>In October 1945, Denson became chief prosecutor of the war crimes trials to be held at the former concentration camp of Dachau in Germany. The first trial opened on November 13, 1945. Forty Nazis and collaborators were charged with participating in the atrocities committed at Dachau concentration camp. All defendants were convicted, thirty-six sentenced to death. In March 1946, Denson served in a similar capacity at the trial of sixty-one Nazis and collaborators from the Mauthausen concentration camp. Convicting all, with fifty-eight sentenced to death, Denson next took over the proceedings of Flossenbürg war crimes trial. Forty-one of the forty-five accused were convicted, with eighteen death sentences. Despite being exhausted from his trial work, Denson served as chief prosecutor against the thirty-one Nazis and collaborators from the Buchenwald concentration camp. The defendants included Ilse Koch, the wife of the commandant of the camp, infamous for her brutality to prisoners, and her alleged use of human skin in lampshades and photo albums. All were convicted, and twenty-two were sentenced to death.</p>
         <p>Returning to the United States, Denson became head of litigation for the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1948, he read that the life imprisonment of Ilse Koch had been reduced to a mere four years, three of which had already been served. Outraged, Denson wrote to newspapers across the country and was invited to speaking engagements and interviews. A congressional committee eventually took the matter up and though her sentence could not be legally reinstated, she was tried by a German court and re-sentenced to life imprisonment. Denson began seeing Countess Constance von Francken-Sierstorpff (Huschi) again, whom he had met while in Europe. On December 31, 1949, the two were married. They raised three children: Yvonne, from Huschi's previous marriage, Olivia, and William, Jr.</p>
         <p>For the next forty years, Denson remained quiet about his war crimes trial experiences. He worked as a lawyer at different firms, dealing especially with patents, trademarks, and copyright law. In the late 1980s, Denson became active in educating the public about Nazi atrocities and his role in bringing Nazis to justice. He continued to do so until his death on December 13, 1998.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by type of material, with a copy of Joshua Greene's book about Denson's war crimes trial work, <title render="italic">
                     Justice at Dachau: The Trials of An American Prosecutor,
                  </title> at the beginning, and one folder of miscellaneous material at the end. Included in the series is a small amount of biographical information, clippings about Denson, interviews, research materials, materials relating to Denson's legal practice, and materials relating to the Yugoslav war crimes trials, in which Denson was personally interested.</p>
               <p>There are four folders of correspondence and a significant amount of writings in the series. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by correspondent and is both personal and professional in nature. Correspondence dates primarily to the period immediately following World War II and from 1990 to Denson's death in 1998. Writings comprise the majority of the series, and the majority of the writings are speeches. Speeches are arranged alphabetically by the organization or group to which Denson was speaking. Most folders include correspondence relating to the speaking engagement and the speech itself. Occasionally an outline or notes for the speech and other related materials are also included. Folders that do not contain the actual speech are noted. "'Justice in Germany.' Memories of the Chief Prosecutor" is particularly interesting because it documents Denson's sentiments and views about the trials in his own words.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Trials is arranged chronologically: one section for each of the war crimes trials in which Denson was chief prosecutor (Dachau, Mauthausen, Flossenbürg, and Buchenwald). The Dachau and Mauthausen trials are primarily documented through the trial transcripts. The pagination of the Dachau trial transcripts continually repeats itself, and has been given artificial part numbers I-VII to ease confusion. In addition to the transcripts, the Buchenwald materials include five folders, primarily consisting of correspondence and clippings, on the reduction of Ilse Koch's sentence from life to four years imprisonment. Within the Buchenwald trials, under "Aftermath," there are two personal letters to Denson from Edwin Katzen-Ellenbogen discussing the specifics of the case against him. These letters are of particular importance because of Denson's interest in convicting Katzen-Ellenbogen and because they are the only documentation in the papers of the sentiments of those whom Denson prosecuted. In addition to the microfilm version of the Flossenbürg trial transcripts, there are four notebooks, which were unlabeled and have been given the artificial titles of A, B, C, and D. These titles do not indicate any specific chronology or sequence. The contents have been removed from the notebooks and placed in folders. They appear to be notebooks used by the prosecution team during the trial. Notebooks B, C, and D contain information about each of the defendants (a similar notebook exists for the Buchenwald trial). Notebook A contains handwritten notes of a legal nature, apparently taken during the trial and perhaps by Denson.</p>

               <p>The series is divided into books and printed materials. Within each group, the materials are arranged alphabetically by title. Some of the books were gifts to Denson and contain personal inscriptions (noted in brackets). At the end of the series are three yearbooks from West Point: 1934, Denson's graduation year; 1944, when Denson was an instructor; and 1984, marking the 50th anniversary of the Class of 1934, which contains a short biography of Denson.</p>

               <p>The Audiovisual Materials series is arranged in three sections: Photographs, Videotapes, and Audiotapes.</p>
               <p>Photographs span the entirety of Denson's life, but the majority are from 1945 to 1950 and are photographs of Denson, his colleagues and friends, concentration camps, witnesses, and defendants at the war crimes trials in Dachau, Germany. The first notebook, labeled "Reference file for publisher," contains low resolution duplicates of some of the photographs and descriptions corresponding to an artificially assigned photograph number. This notebook was put together by Joshua Greene, author of <title render="italic">
                     Justice at Dachau: The Trials of An American Prosecutor
                  </title>, and is a helpful guide in examining the original photographs, which are found in the first ten folders of Box 28. The other photographs are in their original eight notebooks, each with a label that roughly corresponds to its contents. Some of these photographs have descriptions.</p>
               <p>The audiotapes and videotapes are arranged chronologically and are primarily interviews of Denson. Of the fourteen videotapes, seven are interviews. The audiotapes are all interviews conducted by Joshua Greene and used as research for his book.</p>
