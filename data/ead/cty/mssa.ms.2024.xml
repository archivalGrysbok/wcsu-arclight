         <abstract id="aspace_57907c619b86b97911737c5d28a1a194">The collection consists of ephemera, mostly educational brochures, about issues and experiences members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community may face that can impact their mental health. Topics include HIV/AIDS, gender identity, biphobia and bisexual erasure, body image and eating disorders, coming out, queer parenting, domestic violence, stress and anxiety, and trauma. There are also brochures covering kink-aware therapy for those who are interested in BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism) and/or fetish practices, and polyamory-aware therapy for those interested or involved in ethical non-monogamous relationship structures. Finally, there is an information card about Gaylesta's services and mission and a brochure for therapists interested in joining Gaylesta. All materials also give contact information for Gaylesta's referral services. </abstract>

         <p>Gaylesta was founded in 1987 as a psychotherapy association for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community in San Francisco, California. It was formally established as an unincorporated association in 1988 and incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1997. Gaylesta's main services include referring prospective patients to member therapists via a phone number or their website, organized by specialty of the therapist and patient needs, outreach to the LGBTQ community at public events, educational and professional development workshops, and mentoring.</p>
