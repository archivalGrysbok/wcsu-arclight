         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD), located in Boston, Massachusetts, was founded in 1978 by attorney John Ward and a group of New England lawyers and activists.  Ward founded GLAD in response to the Boston Police Department's entrapment of over 100 gay patrons in the Boston Public Library.  The event would become the foundation of GLAD's first case, <title render="italic">
               Doe v. McNiff
            </title>.</p>
         <p>Best known for its litigation of the Massachusetts case <title render="italic">
               Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health
            </title>, which established for the first time the right of same-sex couples to marry, GLAD was one of the first legal organizations in the United States dedicated solely to defending the rights of gay men and lesbians.  Originally established to fight attacks and discrimination against the gay, lesbian and bisexual community, GLAD has, over time, expanded its mission to include transgender people and people with HIV.  In 1985, GLAD launched the AIDS Law Project with the purpose of fighting AIDS-related discrimination, and in the early 1990s, it established the Civil Rights Project to focus on civil rights issues in the gay and lesbian community.  GLAD rewrote its mission statement in 2000 to include the eradication of discrimination based on "gender identity and expression," in addition to "sexual orientation and HIV status," which led to the formal creation of the Transgender Rights Project in 2008.  GLAD has also been committed to educating the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, the legal community, and the general public about the legal and civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and of people with HIV.</p>
         <p>Located in Boston since its inception, GLAD has primarily served the six New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.  It divides its work into three major functions: Legal, Public Affairs &amp; Education, and Development.  The Legal department handles litigation and other legal matters and does most of GLAD's legislative work.  The Public Affairs &amp; Education department fulfills GLAD's mission to educate the public, while the Development department is responsible for generating funds to maintain and grow GLAD's operations, which are primarily supported by donations.</p>
         <p>Although GLAD is a thriving and influential organization, its establishment as a small organization run by volunteers has heavily influenced its administrative history.  The organization is governed by a board of directors and run by an executive director, who is responsible for day-to-day operations. John Ward served as its first executive director until 1983.   In that year, Kathy Travers became the second executive director of GLAD and its first full-time, paid employee.  In 1984, attorney Kevin Cathcart took over the position, which he held for eight years.  Throughout the 1980s, GLAD's staff remained small, and the executive director was responsible for all of GLAD's operations.  GLAD relied on its relationships with outside attorneys to handle many of its cases.  The office manager position became a full-time paid position in 1986, around the same time that GLAD hired its first staff attorney, Denise McWilliams, to direct the AIDS Law Project.  The hiring of McWilliams increased the size of the full-time staff to three.  By 1990, the full-time staff had grown to five with the addition of a development director in 1988 and another staff attorney, Mary Bonauto, in 1990.  During the 1990s, GLAD continued to grow and had several executive directors: Josephine Ross (1992-1993), Jan Platner (1993-1995), Amelia Craig (1995-1997), and Gary Buseck (1997-2003).  In times when the position was left vacant, GLAD staff attorneys Denise McWilliams (in 1992), Mary Bonauto (in 1995), and Bennett Klein (in 1997) stepped in as acting executive director.  In 2005, Lee Swislow became the executive director. By 2010 GLAD had a staff of thirty, including eight attorneys, two distinct departments serving GLAD's development and public affairs/education needs, and a budget of $3.1 million.</p>
         <p>Some of GLAD's notable cases include <title render="italic">
               Doe v. McNiff
            </title> (1978); <title render="italic">
               Babets v. Johnston
            </title> (1985), which addressed the right of same-sex couples to become foster parents; <title render="italic">
               Bragdon v. Abbott
            </title> (1995), which established that people living with HIV/AIDS are protected under the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act; <title render="italic">
               Rosa v. Park West Bank
            </title> (2000) and <title render="italic">
               Doe v. Yunits
            </title> (2000), both of which affirmed the right of transgender people to legal protection against discrimination; <title render="italic">
               Baker v. Vermont
            </title> (1999), which led to the creation of civil unions in Vermont; and <title render="italic">
               Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health
            </title> (2003) and <title render="italic">
               Kerrigan &amp; Mock v. Dept. of Public Health
            </title> (2008), which together established same-sex marriage in their respective states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.</p>

         <p>The records document the organization and activities of the Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD), a nonprofit legal organization dedicated to defending the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and people with HIV, primarily in New England.  The collection primarily consists of correspondence, topical files, reports, meeting minutes, legal research, litigation and amicus files, publications, volunteer and training manuals, and news clippings created or maintained by GLAD.  The records document all aspects of the organization, including its history, structure, and activities from its founding in 1978 to the present. The collection provides a rich resource for the study of GLAD, anti-discrimination efforts, and the legal issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and people with HIV in the United States.</p>
         <p>Material on GLAD's founding and history are found in the collection, as is material related to the administration of the organization. The Board of Directors and Executive Director files include committee reports, a complete set of meeting minutes and packets, correspondence, and topical files providing  a rich overview of GLAD's activities.  Financial records consist of auditor, public charity, and general budget reports, which provide information about GLAD's financial status and growth over the years. Legal files consist of reports and litigation and amicus files, documenting only a few of the cases in which GLAD was involved.  The Public Affairs files provide substantive information which can be used to reconstruct GLAD's history and more generally the history of the legal status of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and people with HIV in the United States.  Of particular note are GLAD's publications and the news clippings they maintained.  The Education files include documentation on GLAD's educational and outreach missions, including its Lawyer Referral Service, InfoLine (a phone based guidance and referral service), forums, and presentations. The Development files document fundraising. In addition to the records generated by GLAD, the collection includes a substantial number of newsletters, flyers, and brochures (Non-GLAD Publications) of various local and national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender organizations (usually only a few items per organization). While not comprehensive, the non-GLAD publications provide a glimpse of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender activist milieu primarily from the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

               <p>The series consists of records documenting GLAD's administration.  It is divided into four sections: Board of Directors; Executive Director; Finance; and Office Administration. The board records consist primarily of minutes, committee records and "packets" which contain documents provided to the board summarizing the work of GLAD's various committees and departments.  The packets provide an overview of various administrative, legal, financial, outreach and organizational matters before GLAD at any given moment. Executive Director files contain correspondence, topical files, notes, memoranda, articles, and reports. The early records of the executive director contain documentation and information that would later (circa 1990) be filed under Development and Public Affairs &amp; Education.</p>

               <p>Materials in this series pertain to <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Bragdon v. Abbott
                  </title>, which was the first court case concerning the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to be heard by the United States Supreme Court, as well as the first case involving HIV to be heard by the court. The case originated in Bangor, Maine in 1994, when dentist Randon Bragdon refused to treat Sidney Abbott at his practice after Abbott disclosed that she was HIV positive. GLAD filed suit on Abbott's behalf in federal district court in Maine in 1995, asserting that Abbott's HIV positive status qualified as a disability, and that Bragdon's refusal of service qualified as discrimination under the ADA. GLAD won this case, known as <title type="simple" render="italic">
                     Abbott v. Bragdon
                  </title>, after which Bragdon's attorneys appealed the decision at the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, where GLAD also won. Bragdon ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 in Abbott's favor in 1998. Materials documenting the case include correspondence, news clippings, memos, background research materials, notes, depositions, briefs, summary judgements, court decisions, and reports.</p>

                     Cote-Whitacre, et al
                  </title> and its related case, also filed by GLAD, <title>
                     Johnstone, et al v. Thomas O'Reilly
