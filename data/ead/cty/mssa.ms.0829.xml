         <p>Anne Morrow Lindbergh (1906 Jun 22  -  2001 Feb 7), author and aviator, was born Anne Spencer Morrow in Englewood, New Jersey, the daughter of Dwight W. Morrow, an investment banker, diplomat, and United States senator and Elizabeth Reeve Cutter, an educator. She had three siblings, Elisabeth, Dwight, Jr., and Constance. She was educated at Miss Chapin's School and Smith College. During her senior year she was introduced to Charles Augustus Lindbergh in December 1927 at the American Embassy in Mexico City where her father was serving as ambassador.  They were married in a secret ceremony in May 1929 at her parents' estate in Englewood, New Jersey.  She wanted to become a professional aviator and undertook an intense study of flying, radio theory, Morse code, and navigation, earning a pilot's license and setting a transcontinental speed record with her husband in 1930 when she was seven months pregnant.  Anne Lindbergh was the first woman in the United States to obtain a glider pilot's license</p>
         <p>In July 1931, the Lindberghs took off on an extended survey flight for Pan American Airways over the Arctic Circle in Canada to Japan and China.  After the tragic kidnapping and murder of her son Charles Jr., in 1932, she took some comfort in narrating her experiences as co-pilot and navigator in her first book, <title>
               North to the Orient
            </title>, published in 1935.  The memoir went on to win the National Book Award and launch a celebrated career. After the birth of their second son, Jon, they undertook a second air survey expedition through the North Atlantic spending a happy period of time in Greenland where they mapped the mountain ranges and took air samples.  They then flew south through Europe to Africa returning across the South Atlantic to Brazil and north to New York.  In 1934, the National Geographic Society recognized her forty thousand miles of exploration with its prestigious Hubbard Award.   She was the first woman to receive it.</p>
         <p>To protect their son Jon from intrusive publicity, the Lindberghs moved to England in 1935 after the kidnapping and murder trial of Bruno Hauptmann.  In 1938 they moved to France to be near her husband's scientific colleague Alexis Carrel.  During those years she wrote about their Atlantic expedition, first for <title>
               National Geographic
            </title> and in a second bestselling book,  <title>
               Listen! The Wind
            </title>, published in 1938.  In <title>
               The Wave of the Future
            </title> (1940), a book-length essay, she tried to interpret their non-interventionist position to the public.  During World War II she was kept busy raising four children: Jon, Land, Scott, and Anne.  While Charles worked on bomber development at the Ford factory, Anne found some time to study sculpting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art.  Her last child, Reeve, was born in 1946.  From the late 1940s through the 1960s, Anne Lindbergh published a large number of articles and poems in literary, women's, and general magazines on a variety of personal and international issues.  She wrote about the importance of balancing personal needs, social expectations, and obligations to family and community in her most popular and enduring work, <title>
               Gift from the Sea
            </title> (1955). Next to the Bible it was the non-fiction best seller of the year and sold 430,000 copies.  To date, well over eight million copies have been sold, and at least 30,000 copies are sold annually.</p>
         <p>Anne Morrow Lindbergh was motivated to write an essay, "The Heron and the Astronaut," after the Lindberghs attended the Apollo 8 launch from the Kennedy Space Center on December 21, 1968, the astronauts' first flight into the orbit of the moon.  It was published in 1969 under the title <title>
               Earth Shine
            </title>, with her essay on Africa, "Immersion in Life."  The Lindberghs built a modest home in Hana, Maui, Hawaii in 1969-1970.  Working with the Nature Conservancy, Anne and Charles Lindbergh made substantial contributions toward the purchase of land in the Valley of the Seven Sacred Pools in Maui to extend Haleakala National Park more than 4000 acres from the inland crater to the ocean.  After her husband's death in 1974, she devoted much of her time to editing and publishing five volumes of her diaries and letters covering her life through the end of World War II.</p>
         <p>Anne Morrow Lindbergh was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame July 21, 1979, "for outstanding contributions to aviation by her participation in pioneering flights surveying air routes to the Orient and Europe, and as an extraordinary author encouraging public appreciation of aviation and air travel."  In the 1990s she moved from her home in Connecticut to her daughter Reeve's family farm in Vermont.  Reeve Lindbergh dealt with the last seventeen months of her mother's life in the book <title>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The papers consist of correspondence, diaries, writings, childhood, school and college materials, housekeeping and social records, reports, memoranda and correspondence from the many organizations in which Anne Morrow Lindbergh took an active interest. Also included is voluminous mail from members of her reading public and memorabilia, both objects sent by admirers and items collected by her on her travels. The death of Charles Lindbergh in 1974 is documented by mail from friends, members of the public and organizations. Anne Morrow Lindbergh's writings make up the largest part of the papers and include her diaries (1929-1972, 1982-1988), drafts of her books, working notebooks, speeches, articles and stories and published reviews of her work. Also in the papers are printed copies of her publications. Her personal correspondence with friends and family runs over many years. Correspondence with friends includes letters exchanged with Anne Carrel, Harry Guggenheim, Corliss Lamont, Harold and Nigel Nicolson, Vita Sackville-West, Igor Sikorsky, Truman and Katherine Smith, Helen and Kurt Wolff, Jean Stafford and Mary Ellen Chase. Her family correspondence contains letters exchanged by Anne Morrow Lindbergh and members of her immediate family as well as members of the Morrow, Lindbergh and Cutter families.</p>
         <p>In the introduction to the first published volume of her diaries and letters, <title>
               Bring Me a Unicorn
            </title>, Anne Morrow Lindbergh noted that in the Morrow family "an experience was not finished, not truly experienced, unless written down or shared with another."  This passion for committing experiences and events to writing is one of the unifying forces in Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life.  Her personal papers are a rarity for a contemporary individual, in that they provide almost complete documentation for the entirety of her life.</p>
         <p>Through her papers Anne Morrow Lindbergh can be studied from a number of perspectives: as a writer (diarist, poet, essayist, and novelist); social critic; pioneer aviator; conservationist; and mother, housekeeper, and wife of one of the century's most noted persons.  Taken as a whole, the collection documents her continuing efforts at self realization.</p>

               <p>The series consists of letters Lindbergh received from a large circle of friends and acquaintances.  For Lindbergh's replies to the letters in this series, see the appropriate dates in Series VI, Outgoing correspondence.</p>
               <p>By contemporary standards the correspondence is prolific and reveals the important role that friendship played in her life.  Some of the people who corresponded with her from childhood on include Lucia (Norton) Valentine, Amy Aldrich, Vernon Munroe, Jr., Sue (Vaillant) Hatt, and Corliss Lamont.  The correspondence of another childhood friend, Elizabeth "Dizzy' Hart, is of interest for the picture it gives of Anne Morrow Lindbergh as a school girl.</p>
               <p>Major correspondents whose relationships with Lindbergh were particularly close and whose correspondence is voluminous include Dana Atchley, Ernestine (Stodelle) Chamberlain, Corliss Lamont, and Ruth (Thomas) Oliff.  Other important correspondents include Dom Alexis (Abbot of Boquen), Anne Carrel (wife of Alexis Carrel), Harry Guggenheim, Harold and Nigel Nicolson,Vita Sackville-West, Igor Sikorsky, Truman and Katherine Smith, Eleanor and James Newton, Kitty Taquey, John Oldrin, and Helen and Kurt Wolff.</p>
               <p>After college, Lindbergh remained in contact with two Smith College faculty members, Mina (Kirstein) Curtiss and Marthe Sturm. The correspondence from Curtiss is especially interesting because of the close friendship that developed between the former English professor and the writer.</p>
               <p>Lindbergh corresponded with a number of artists, writers, and journalists.  There is correspondence from Betsey Barton, Evelyn Ames, Jean Stafford, Sylvia Shaw Judson, Selden Rodman, Isabel La Follette, Russell Leffingwell, Lauren Dwight (Deac) Lyman, Carl Milles, Florida Scott-Maxwell, Mary Ellen Chase, and Stanley R. Ross.</p>
               <p>America First activities are documented in correspondence from Kathleen Norris, Katrina Romney, Thelma Lee, and Sue (Vaillant) Hatt.  Former employees (secretaries and children's nurses) with whom Lindbergh continued to correspond include Betty Gow, Felice Hankey, Gertrude Gloor, Judy Frautschi, Monte Millar, Marta (Brodie) Norris, Barbara Mansfield, Christine (Gawne) Wick, and Jean Saunders.</p>

                     Saturday Review of Literature
                  </title>, and other small publishing firms and magazines.</p>
               <p>Subjects covered in the series include solicitations; routine editing and proofreading issues; book design; contract negotiations; sales and royalties; awards; reprints; and film rights and adaptations.  Individuals represented include John Hall Wheelock (<title>
                     Scribner's
                  </title>), Dewitt Wallace and Paul Palmer (<title>

Their letters contain discussion of general publishing issues as well as comments on Lindbergh's work and critiques of their own work and that of other authors they represent.  Lindbergh's substantial correspondence from Helen and Kurt Wolff can be found under Pantheon Books through 1960, and thereafter under Harcourt, Brace and World, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.  It reveals the intimate, interdependent working relationship between author and editor.  In addition to business details and general editing matters, their letters offer encouragement, suggestions for revisions, discussion of general theories of literary production, and comments on Lindbergh's style of creation and development as an author (see Series I Correspondence From Friends and Acquaintances, for the Wolff's personal correspondence with Lindbergh).  Charles Lindbergh took an active interest in the publication of Anne's diaries.  His correspondence with Helen Wolff and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich  can be found in the Charles A. Lindbergh Papers and contains information on contract issues, the gathering and copying of  diaries and letters, delivery of manuscripts, and editing revisions.</p>

               <p>The series is comprised of letters that fall into the following categories: personal letters from friends and acquaintances who wrote to Lindbergh fewer than five times; routine business correspondence; autograph requests; letters from the general public commenting on Lindbergh's activities; and requests that Lindbergh give speeches, serve on committees, and write articles on behalf of various religious, cultural, philanthropic, and political causes.  Much of the correspondence in the series is routine.  Viewed in its entirety, however, it reveals two aspects of Lindbergh's life.  First, the close scrutiny to which her life, both public and private, was subjected to an intensely curious public, and second, her great influence and popularity as a writer with its corresponding demands on her time.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged chronologically by publication date of the work to which the letters pertain.  For each work, letters are arranged into two groups: General, for persons unknown to Lindbergh, and Personal, for friends and family.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains letters commenting on Lindbergh's writings. Works that elicited particularly voluminous correspondence are "Prayer for Peace" (1940), "Feeding Europe" (1940), <title>
                     The Wave of the Future
                  </title> (1940), <title>
                     Gift from the Sea
                  </title> (1955), and <title>
                     Bring Me a Unicorn
                  </title> (1971).  Letters about "Feeding Europe" also include those that relate to the general question of sending relief to the occupied countries.  Letters concerning the Lindberghs' stand on intervention in World War II are included under <title>
                     Wave of the Future
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>The responses of readers to Lindbergh's work frequently center on the themes of mourning and recovery from personal loss; the role of a woman as wife, mother, and creative person; the loneliness and exhilaration of adolescence; and the individual's responsibility to act, whether as a peacemaker, conservationist, or artist.  Although Lindbergh described her life as an "extraordinary" one led by "a quite ordinary person," it was her ability to convey the "ordinary," which allowed her readers to identify closely with her.  She frequently placed an asterisk (*) on those letters which she termed "special."  (For her replies to letters in this series, see the appropriate date in Series VI, Outgoing Correspondence).</p>

               <p>The addition is arranged in ten sections: Correspondence from friends and acquaintances; Family correspondence and records; Correspondence with publishers: General correspondence; Correspondence from readers; Outgoing correspondence; Writings; Houskeeping and social records; Institutions, committees, and clubs; and Memorabilia.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Headings in the addition correspond to titles of series from the main accession.  In all of the correspondence, missing dates and names have been transcribed from the envelopes.  Lindbergh annotated some letters "RU" for "request unanswered."  Others are marked "Answer" or "To be answered," but Outgoing correspondence does not contain responses to all of these letters.  The addition reflects the wide range of Lindbergh's activities and contacts in the period 1973-1976, but more than half concerns the death of her husband, Charles, in 1974.  There are many sympathy cards and letters of condolence.</p>

               <p>The addition is arranged in ten sections: Correspondence from friends and acquaintances; Family correspondence and records; Correspondence with publishers; General correspondence; Correspondence with readers; Outgoing correspondence; Writings; Housekeeping and social records; Institutions, committees, and clubs; and Memorabilia.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Headings in the addition correspond to series titles in the main accession.  The addition contains some material concerning the death of Charles Augustus Lindbergh in 1974, but most of the papers reflect Anne Morrow Lindbergh's activities from 1976 to 1981, including her involvement with a variety of ceremonies commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of her husband's 1927 flight.  Incoming correspondence is often annotated.  Usually, annotations on general correspondence were made by the secretary, while annotations on personal correspondence were made by Lindbergh.  Their abbreviations include "RA" and "RU," for "requests answered" and "requests unanswered," and "LVM" for "lost in volume of mail" (and therefore not answered).  Not all drafts and carbons of outgoing correspondence are found under that heading.  Some are filed with the letters to which they respond under Correspondence with readers.  Materials related to fiftieth anniversary activities are found with the Charles A. Lindbergh Memorial Fund under Institutions, committees, and clubs.</p>
