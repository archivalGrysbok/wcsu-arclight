         <p>David Knapp was born in New York City on September 2, 1926. He joined the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) at the age of twelve and later worked for the BSA in volunteer and professional positions for many years. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1949. He has been an active church member throughout his adult life. Knapp married Mary Adelaide Wheeler in 1958, becoming a stepfather to her two daughters. A year later, they had another daughter. After he married, he left his professional position at the BSA and became a salesman. Knapp moved his family to Connecticut in 1970 to pursue career advancement.</p>
         <p>Knapp discovered he was gay in the late 1970s at the age of fifty. Ten years later, he and his wife divorced. Knapp was outed to the BSA and to his church by family members and was consequently expelled by both organizations. His experiences prompted him to become an activist for gay and lesbian rights. He is engaged in a long term campaign to change the BSA position on homosexuality. He is involved in Scouting For All, an organization that also seeks to make the BSA welcoming of gay boys and men. He led his church, the First Church of Christ of Guilford, in its efforts to become open and affirming. He is a member and former leader of Stonewall Speakers, a Connecticut-based lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender speakers bureau. Additionally, Knapp started GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network) and PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) chapters in Connecticut.
