         <p>The American philologist and historian John Eastburn Boswell (1947- 1994) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on March 20, 1947. He attended the College of William and Mary, graduating in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts in history, and Harvard, earning a doctorate in history in 1975. His dissertation was published as <title render="italic">
               The Royal Treasure: Muslim Communities under the Crown of Aragon in the Fourteenth Century
            </title> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977). In 1975 Boswell began teaching in the History Department at Yale. Five years later he published his second book, the pioneering <title render="italic">
               Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century
            </title> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). In 1988 Boswell published <title render="italic">
               The Kindness of Strangers: Child Abandonment in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance
            </title> (New York: Pantheon Books). Boswell was named A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History in 1990, when he began a two-year term as Chairman of the Yale History Department. In the last year of his life, Boswell published the groundbreaking and controversial <title render="italic">
               Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe
            </title> (New York: Villard Books, 1994).</p>
         <p>John Boswell was the second child of Catherine S. Eastburn and Colonel Henry Boswell, Jr.  As a child in a military family, he spent his early years in Georgia, at West Point, in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and abroad in Ankara, Turkey, as well as Spain and West Germany.  Boswell was raised as a Quaker and then became an Episcopalian before converting to Catholicism at age fifteen. Boswell's Catholicism quickly became central to his ethos, and would exert a profound influence on his scholarship, as well on as his personal life. Indeed, in the years ahead, colleagues would often skeptically call upon him to explain how someone so profoundly learned and rational could also be deeply religious.</p>
         <p>Boswell attended the College of William and Mary where, as a National Merit Scholar, he became a member of the honorary fraternities Phi Eta Sigma, Pi Delta Epsilon, Eta Sigma Phi, and Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts as an Outstanding Graduate in History. A few years later, Boswell began an intimate relationship with Jerone R. Hart, a relationship that lasted until Boswell's death.</p>
         <p>In 1970 Boswell entered the graduate program in history at Harvard, where he was awarded both Woodrow Wilson and Graduate Prize fellowships and earned a master's in 1971 and a doctorate in 1975.  His dissertation, written under the supervision of Giles Constable and Jocelyn Hillgarth, comprised a social study of the relationships between the Muslim subject minority and the dominant Christian society in medieval Spain. This work was published as <title render="italic">
               The Royal Treasure: Muslim Communities under the Crown of Aragon in the Fourteenth Century
            </title> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977). In 1975 Boswell began teaching at Yale as Assistant Professor of History. In 1978 his students voted him one of the eleven best teachers at Yale.</p>
         <p>Boswell studied many foreign languages over the course of his life: Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian, Church Slavonic, Aragonese, Provençal, and Old Icelandic/Norse, as well as some classical Armenian, Syriac, and Persian. He often remarked to colleagues that his practice was to teach himself one new language each year.</p>
         <p>Ten years of research, begun while in graduate school and conducted alongside his dissertation, led to the publication of Boswell's second book, <title render="italic">
               Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century
            </title> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). It should be noted that Boswell often remarked that he had been warned by friends and colleagues not to publish this book for fear that such a controversial publication would destroy his academic reputation, and that he savored the irony that the work instead considerably enhanced his career. <title render="italic">
               Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality
            </title> immediately garnered high praise: <title render="italic">
               The New York Times Book Review
            </title> selected it as one of eleven best books of 1980; it was one of five non-fiction nominees for National Book Critics Circle Award; and it won the American Book Award for History and a Melcher Award in 1981. The success of this book resulted in Boswell's promotion at Yale from Associate Professor to Professor of History in 1982.  The book was eventually translated into French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
         <p>Also in 1982, Boswell was honored with the William Clyde DeVane Medal for Teaching and Scholarship. Moreover, he authored the pamphlet (based on the Fifth Michael Harding Memorial Address) <title render="italic">
               Rediscovering Gay History: Archetypes of Gay Love in Christian History
            </title> (London: Gay Christian Movement, 1982) and the article "Revolutions, Universals, Categories" in the journal <title render="italic">
               Salmagundi
            </title>. The latter was eventually reprinted with revisions in Martin Bauml Duberman et al., eds., <title render="italic">
               Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past
            </title> (New York: NAL, 1989). From 1984 to 1986 he served as Director of Graduate Studies for the Yale History Department. In 1987 Boswell helped organize the Lesbian and Gay Studies Center at Yale, which by the mid-1990s became the Research Fund for Lesbian and Gay Studies.</p>
         <p>In 1988 Boswell published <title render="italic">
               The Kindness of Strangers: The Abandonment of Children in Western Europe from Late Antiquity to the Renaissance
            </title> (New York: Pantheon Books). This book was eventually translated into Dutch, French, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish. Also in 1988 Boswell became Director of Special Programs in the Humanities (until 1990) and Chair of Medieval Studies at Yale. In 1989 he was appointed as one of thirteen associate editors of the new <title render="italic">
               Journal of the History of Sexuality
            </title> (University of Chicago Press) and as Advisory Board Member for History of Columbia University Press's Gay and Lesbian series. He was named A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History in 1990, when he began a two-year term as Chairman of the Yale History Department.</p>
         <p>In the fall of 1991 Boswell was diagnosed with what his doctors initially thought was Lyme disease, and complications from this ailment led to spinal meningitis. By early 1992 Boswell was diagnosed with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and deadly brain disease. It was later discovered that the so-called Lyme disease Boswell had contracted was actually AIDS, and that the spinal meningitis and PML were both AIDS-related.</p>
         <p>In the last year of his life, Boswell published <title render="italic">
               Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe
            </title> (New York: Villard Books, 1994). Boswell died of complications from AIDS in New Haven on 24 December 1994. At Yale Commencement in 1995 he was posthumously awarded the Harwood F. Byrnes/Richard B. Sewall Teaching Prize in recognition of his instruction of undergraduates.</p>

         <p>The papers primarily consist of correspondence, lectures, research notes, writings (academic and fiction), biographical records, subject files, and memorabilia (including awards and popular press writings about Boswell). The papers document Boswell's personal life, from childhood to adulthood, as well as his professional life as an openly gay professor of history at Yale and pioneering author of two revisionist histories documenting the relationship between gay people and Christianity in the Middle Ages: <title render="italic">
               Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century
            </title> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980) and <title render="italic">
               Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe
            </title> (New York: Villard Books, 1994). Of particular note are the large number of electronic files Boswell created in the 1980s and 1990s. Stored on 162 floppy disks, these files provide, among other things, much of Boswell's outgoing correspondence during the last thirteen years of his life, as well as research notes and drafts of some of his professional writings. The paper and electronic correspondence, some of it of an extremely personal and intimate nature, documents Boswell's relationship with his mother, his younger sister, Patricia, his brothers, Wray and Henry III, his partner, Jerone R. Hart, his close friend Ralph J. Hexter, New Haven neighbors, academic publishers, various Yale students and colleagues, and other academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and Japan.</p>
         <p>The biographical records feature birth and other vital records, passports, and résumés. Boswell's memorabilia consists primarily of awards and popular press writings about him. The writings in the professinal files include commonplace books, travel diaries, student work, creative writing, and petitions in legal cases involving gay and lesbian military officers, as well as scholarship. Both paper and electronic writings feature drafts of some but not all of his scholarly work.  Notably absent are drafts of <title render="italic">
               The Royal Treasure
            </title> (a small portion of which is included in the Personal Papers Series as part of his dissertation) and of <title render="italic">
               The Kindness of Strangers
            </title>, for example, whereas a complete paper draft of <title render="italic">
               Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality
            </title> is included. Parts of <title render="italic">
               Same-Sex Unions
            </title> can be found in the electronic files, though not in the paper files. Along with his syllabi, course packs, lectures, conference papers, research notes, photocopies of source material (much of it in foreign languages), and published reviews of his books by others, these materials offer a particularly rich trove of material because they document Boswell's development both as a gay man and as a leading medieval historian from an early age. Some handwritten notes and original folder labels are cryptically abbreviated or written in foreign languages, typically Greek, Latin, or Arabic.</p>

               <p>The correspondence is arranged alphabetically and comprises primarily incoming letters to Boswell. There is some posthumous correspondence sent to his partner, Jerone Hart, and literary executor Ralph Hexter.  The correspondence documents Boswell's personal and family life and his life as an openly gay and highly productive Yale historian and administrator. The most substantive portion of the paper correspondence concerns Boswell's personal life, although professional communications also figure prominently. Of particular interest are letters from friends and family, colleagues at Yale and other academic institutions, and academic publishers.  Notable correspondents, all pioneers in gay and lesbian scholarship, include George Chauncey, John P. De Cecco, Martin Bauml Duberman, David F. Greenberg, Richard D. Mohr, and Paul Gordon Schalow.</p>
               <p>Additional correspondence can be found in Series III, Professional files, and Series IV, Electronic files, which contains most of the outgoing correspondence in the papers.</p>

               <p>The series is comprised of vital records, passports, report cards, academic transcripts, résumés, commonplace books, travel diaries, student work (high school through graduate school), unpublished fiction writings, published interviews featuring Boswell as the subject, a program and transcript of his memorial service, published obituaries, published and unpublished commemorative writings about him, and memorabilia including diplomas and awards primarily documenting Boswell's personal life. His college and graduate school years, as well as his creative writing efforts through the mid-1980s, are particularly well documented.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is comprised of manuscripts of Boswell's numerous publications, teaching materials (including lectures, presentations, notes on 3x5" index cards, syllabi and course packs), photocopies of foreign language source materials, research notes (also on 3x5" index cards), offprints of scholarly articles by Boswell and others, reviews of his books, cassette tapes of a 1983 lecture on gays and Christianity,  Boswell's draft reviews of others scholars' books and manuscripts, and documents related to petitions in legal cases concerning gay and lesbian military officers. Of particular interest is the extensive documentation of his scholarly efforts, especially source materials, partial and complete drafts, correspondence with publishers and from readers, and research notes. By far the most voluminous such documentation concerns <title render="italic">
                     Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality
                  </title>. Also included here are notes on and drafts of various papers delivered at scholarly conferences throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. Numerous photocopies of foreign language source materials thoroughly document obscure aspects of European church history from the Middle Ages, notably attitudes toward and dogma concerning marriage, homosexuals, and homosexuality.  Other foreign language source materials document attitudes toward and examples of the abandonment of children in Europe from antiquity to the Renaissance. There are no paper drafts of <title render="italic">
                     Same-Sex Unions
                  </title>, <title render="italic">

               <p>Additional writings can be found in Series IV, Electronic files. The electronic files include drafts of articles, book chapters, lectures, presentations, and <title render="italic">
