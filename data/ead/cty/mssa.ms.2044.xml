         <p>James King Bidwell was born on February 2, 1934 in Pontiac, Michigan, the son of Howard King and Ruth Louella Kinney Bidwell. He attended Yale College from 1952 to 1956 and belonged to the Timothy Dwight residential college. He majored in mathematics. He also served on the staff of Timothy Dwight from 1953 to 1954, worked for the Department of Mathematics from 1954 to 1956, served as co-chair of the Sophomore Counseling Committee from 1955 to 1956, and was a member of the Yale Dramatic Association (Dramat) from 1953 to 1956. He met his future wife, Marilyn Marion Fox, during this time period. They married on June 28, 1958. His son Paul K. Bidwell was born in 1961. After graduating from Yale, he received a MS in Education in 1957 from the University of Illinois and became an secondary school math teacher. He then graduated from the University of Michigan in 1968 with a Ph.D in mathematics education. He later became a professor of mathematics at Central Michigan University, retiring as Professor Emeritus in 1997.</p>
