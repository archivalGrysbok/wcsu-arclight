         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Kenneth Farrand Simpson was born in New York City on May 4, 1895 into a socially prominent family. His father was a well-known throat specialist and professor of laryngology at Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Simpson attended Hill School and was a member of the Yale College Class of 1917. He served in the military during World War I and was stationed in France from June, 1918 until the summer of 1919. On his return to the United States, he entered the Harvard Law School and completed his LL.B. degree in 1922. He was admitted to the bar in the same year and began his legal practice in New York City.</p>
         <p>Simpson initially joined the legal firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, but in 1925, after becoming involved in Republican Party politics, Simpson was offered a position as assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. At the time, the government was attempting to adjudicate a number of cases involving German-owned property which had been confiscated during World War I. Simpson became a specialist in tracing vital witnesses who resided abroad. He made several trips to Europe, during one of which he met Alexander Kerensky, the former premier of Russia, who became a good friend.</p>
         <p>Simpson resigned from the United States attorney's office at the end of 1927 to become a partner in the firm of Barnes, McKenna &amp; Halstead (later Barnes, Richardson &amp; Halstead). Severing his connection with this firm in 1934, he joined Hunt, Hill &amp; Betts, where he worked until 1939 when he formed the partnership of Simpson, Brady &amp; Noonan.</p>
         <p>As his legal career developed, Simpson became more and more engrossed with politics and rose to positions of leadership within the Republican Party. A liberal who believed his party had to abandon some of its conservative dogma to win and who exhibited a tolerance for the New Deal, Simpson served as president of his district club, 15th Assembly-District leader, and state committeeman. In 1935 Simpson was elected to the powerful position of Republican county chairman and from then on played a crucial role in rebuilding the New York Republican Party.</p>
         <p>In 1937, Simpson orchestrated the reelection of Fusion Party candidate Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia with Republican Party endorsement. Simpson's efforts also insured the election of Republican candidates for president of the Board of Alderman and comptroller. Simpson also persuaded Thomas E. Dewey to run for the office of District Attorney and Bruce Barton to seek election to the House of Representatives from the 17th Congressional District. The success of these candidates marked Simpson as a political boss, and in December he was elected to the Republican National Committee to succeed Charles Dewey Hilles. Simpson worked hard in Dewey's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1938, but by late 1939 Simpson had become disenchanted with him. Simpson saw Dewey as usurping his political authority and declared his opposition to Dewey's presidential bid in 1940. He played a vital role in nominating the liberal Wendell Wilkie and stopping Dewey. Simpson worked hard in Wilkie's unsuccessful campaign, while triumphing in his own bid for election from the 17th Congressional District. Shortly after being sworn-in as a member of the House of Representatives, Simpson died of a heart attack on January 25, 1941.</p>
         <p>In 1925 Simpson married Helen-Louise Knickerbocker Porter. They had four children. In addition to his political achievements, Simpson and his wife contributed to the civic organizations and cultural life of New York. He was a member of the Player's Club, the Grand Street Boys' Association, and the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and was a patron of music and a collector of modern art. He numbered among his friends cultural leaders such as Norman Bel Geddes, Gilbert Seldes, and Gertrude Stein.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is composed of incoming and outgoing letters of both a personal and political nature. Correspondence with clients is included in the case and client files in Series IV. The correspondence is arranged in chronological order, and until 1934 there is little that relates to politics. Letters in 1913 from his father date from Simpson's freshman year at Yale, while the 1925 files contain messages of congratulation on his engagement.</p>
               <p>The files become more voluminous after Simpson's appointment as county chairman of the Republican Committee of New York County in September, 1935. Though the files do contain some exchanges with other Republican Party leaders such as Alfred Landon, Charles Dewey Hilles, Amos Pinchot, and Stanley M. Isaacs, which contain discussions of campaign strategy or policy matters, congratulatory messages from acquaintances and the general public form the bulk of the series. In 1937 there are letters of opinion concerning Republican support for the reelection of Fiorello LaGuardia, and 1938 letters contain voters' views of the candidacy of John O'Connor for Congress. In the 1939 files there are letters concerning organizational work for primaries and the efforts to unseat Simpson as Republican county committeeman. Strife within the party is further reflected in the correspondence of April, 1940, when Simpson faced an attempt to force him off the Republican National Committee. The files later in 1940 bulk large with letters concerning Wilkie's nomination and campaign for president, Simpson's own nomination and successful campaign for Congress, and the flattering portrait of Simpson published in Life magazine.</p>
               <p>The files include letters from close personal friends, such as Norman Bel Geddes, Maurice Leon, and Lyttleton Gould concerning many topics. The series concludes with several folders of correspondence with Dorothy Dudley Harvey and a file of letters concerning candidates for admittance to the bar. Simpson served as the legal advisor to Harvey, an author, and her husband. Papers concerning this professional relationship are found in Series IV. The correspondence in this series is strictly personal, is much larger than that with any of Simpson's other correspondents, and reflects their long and close relationship.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series consists of notes, drafts of policy papers, financial papers, election statistics, campaign literature and other printed ephemera, press releases, and newspaper stories, which relate to Kenneth Simpson's involvement in New York City Republican Party politics, national presidential campaigns, and his own campaign for congress in 1940. The files also include constituent correspondence and notes relating to legislation generated during Simpson's brief tenure in the House of Representatives. The scrapbooks in Series VI cover similar topics.</p>
               <p>The political papers are organized chronologically and the earliest date from 1934 when Simpson served on a committee investigating taxicab service. The files for the mayoral campaign of 1937 contain many statements by Simpson as he attempted to secure Republican Party endorsement for Fiorello LaGuardia for mayor. The most numerous files are those for 1940, covering Simpson's split with Thomas Dewey, his support for Wendell Wilkie for the presidential nomination, and his campaign for the 17th Congressional District seat.</p>
               <p>The series concludes with congressional files from Simpson's three weeks in Washington. Most of the constituent mail concerns "Lend-Lease" legislation, H.R. 1776, providing aid to Great Britain. Simpson favored passage of some form of this bill, but his constituent mail provides a view of the opposition's arguments as well as the broader scope sought by many supporters.</p>

               <p>This series includes notes, letters, drafts for briefs, published material, and other types of papers relating to Kenneth Simpson's legal practice. Though there are files for cases or clients Simpson represented in each of his positions and partnerships including his work with the United States district attorney's office, the files do not appear to be comprehensive, and it is not clear what portion of Simpson's case load is represented. The files are arranged in alphabetical order by case or client name.</p>
               <p>Most of the files document fairly routine legal matters such as wills, divorces, estate settlements, receiverships, actions for rent, and the like. Among the files one finds the names of many prominent cultural figures whom Simpson advised or represented including Edmund Wilson, Dorothy Dudley Harvey, Evangeline Stokowska, Mary Mayo, Alexander Kerensky, Gilbert Seldes, and Pierre Matisse. Files of Andrew Somers relate to Simpson's work as counsel to the congressman during the proceedings instituted to impeach U. S. District Judge Grover Moscowitz. There are also several files for Flo Renyx, a Republican Party activist, concerning her role as a receiver in several cases. Many other files relate to Simpson's own participation as a receiver or court appointed special guardian.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is composed of papers which relate to Kenneth Simpson's day to day activities. They are more general in nature than the political papers and case and client files contained in the previous series. The few legal files in the series concern personal matters of Simpson and his family. Materials in the series are arranged by record type and are listed in alphabetical order. The largest categories of records are the financial papers and memorabilia. The financial papers include account books, check counterfoils and other records of the Simpsons' investments and household expenses. Included in the folders of memorabilia are programs and other types of printed ephemera from social, political, and cultural events attended by Simpson including the 1939 New York World's Fair and the Republican National Convention in 1940.</p>
               <p>The series also includes papers of other family members and, to a limited extent, documents Helen Simpson's activities, particularly after her husband's death. In her files there is a small amount of personal correspondence including a letter of condolence from President Roosevelt and a few letters from Alice B. Toklas. Photographs, which are at the end of the series, include pictures of Simpson and his family, as well as Simpson at various political and civic events.</p>

               <p>The nine scrapbooks of newspaper clippings in this series provide very thorough coverage of Simpson's role in New York politics from 1937-1940. They focus on the "Fusion" candidates in the New York City mayoral election of 1937, Fiorello LaGuardia and Thomas Dewey, the growing power struggle within the New York State Republican Party, and Simpson's split with the party's majority over Dewey's candidacy for the presidential nomination in 1940. The scrapbooks also document the Wilkie campaign and Simpson's own election to Congress in 1940. The original scrapbooks were microfilmed in 1981 and 2002 and the fragile originals discarded.</p>
