Included are letters to Walter Camp from Yale men commenting on the games of November and December, 1900, and a letter from Camp to Brown (December 18, 1900) on football strategy. Of particular interest is a letter from Theodore Roosevelt (June 22, 1901) inviting Brown to a gathering at Oyster Bay along with other Yale and Harvard athletes where Roosevelt hoped to encourage a "more vivid interest of a practical kind in politics." There is also a scrapbook containing tickets, badges, programs, menus, newspaper clippings and other Yale memorabilia, in addition to letters and photographs of the team.</abstract>

         <p>Francis Gordon Brown, son of Francis Gordon Brown, a graduate of the Columbia School of Mines in 1867, and of Julia Noyes (Tracy) Brown, was born in New York City, September 6, 1879. He was fitted for college at the Groton (Mass.) School.</p>
         <p>Throughout his college course he maintained the rank of a philosophical oration stand, and in athletics he made a most distinguished record. He was a member of the University Football Team four years, famous as guard, and in Senior year was captain. He was captain of the Freshman Crew, and rowed in the University race against Harvard in Sophomore year. He was also a member of the Track Team in his Senior year. He won many social honors, and was esteemed by all for his character as a man.</p>
         <p>Since graduation he had been in the banking business with the firm of J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., in New York City, where he had applied himself closely to his work, and had shown an aptitude which promised eminence in the financial world.</p>
         <p>Mr. Brown died of diabetes at his home in Glen Head, L. I., N. Y., May 10, 1911, in the 32d year of his age.</p>
         <p>He married, April 27, 1905, Caroline Lawrence Bogert, daughter of Henry Lawrence and Carrie (Osgood) Bogert, who survives him with a son. A brother, Charles Tracy Brown, who was a member of the class of 1903 in the College, died in 1900.</p>
