         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>In December 1918, Jack Crawford, professor of English at Yale University, donated to the Yale University Library his collection of theater-related programs, playbills and printed and pictorial material. Until his retirement in 1946, Jack Crawford developed, maintained and publicized the collection. His involvement in the theater community of New Haven (he and his wife founded the first Little Theater in New Haven in 1921) and in the academic community provided him with opportunitites to advertise his collection and solicit donations of performing arts memorabilia. Originally housed in a small room in the old University Library, the collection was moved in 1930 to a specially designed room in the new Sterling Memorial Library. The collection expanded rapidly over the years, and was moved several times within the Library to accommodate its growth. In 1984, the collection was moved to Manuscripts and Archives.</p>
         <p>The Crawford Theater Collection consists of playbills and programs, photographs in a variety of formats, engravings, posters, clippings and other printed material which document the performing arts in the United States and throughout the world from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries. Material relating to dramatic performance forms the nucleus of the collection, but dance, opera, motion picture, circus, radio and television performances are also represented.</p>
         <p>The Crawford Theater Collection consists of approximately 500 linear feet of material and is arranged in the following six series:</p>    
         <list>
            <item>I. PLAYBILLS AND PROGRAMS, 1663-1989</item>
            <item>II. PICTORIAL MATERIAL, 1800-1980</item>
            <item>III. POSTERS, 1850-1980</item>
            <item>IV. CLIPPINGS, 1800-1980</item>
            <item>V. MISCELLANEA, 1850-1980</item>
            <item>VI. PRINTED MATERIAL, 1900-1980</item>
         </list>
         <p>SERIES I, PLAYBILLS AND PROGRAMS, 1663-1989, consists of programs and playbills documenting theater, musical theater, variety, vaudeville, dance, motion picture, circus, and opera productions. While material from the British Isles (England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) and the United States is most prominant, the series contains programs and playbills from throughout the world. Dominating the series are programs which document performances in the major theaters of London, Boston, New Haven, New York and Philadelphia. Amateur, avant-garde, and college and university productions are represented to a lesser degree. The majority of programs are complete; however, many productions are represented by clipped cast lists only. Fewer then twenty early playbills are in the form of reproductions. Theater and music performances at Yale University are documented in the series. Additional programs for the Yale Dramatic Association productions may be found in the Association's records within the Yale University Archives record group 40-A-33. Programs mounted in scrapbooks are listed under Series IV, Clippings.</p>
         <p>Due to their age, size, and type, the playbills and programs have been arranged in seven subseries, A through G. Subseries descriptions immediately precede the box listing for each subseries, and must be read to fully understand the distinctions between subseries. Basically, the division of subseries A through D is based on size, and the division of subseries E through G is based on type. One may need to review several subseries in order to find playbills and programs for any one production or for all holdings from a particular city or theater. The general descriptions of the subseries are as follows:</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>The material within this subseries is arranged chronologically by year; within each year material is arranged alphabetically by city (Material is not categorized by country; within any one year, for example, Boston would follow Berlin); within each city material is alphabetically arranged by title of production. Programs for soloist performances are filed under the name of the soloist rather than under a production title. Variety and vaudeville performances are filed under those terms rather than under a production title. Amateur and summer stock company productions are filed either under the name of the company or under the production title.</p>
                  <p>Undated material, and dated material with an unidentified production location, follows the main run of material. Undated material is arranged by title of production after country, state, and city. Dated material with an unidentified production location is arranged alphabetically by title of production.</p>
