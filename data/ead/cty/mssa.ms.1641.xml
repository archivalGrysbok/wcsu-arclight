         <p>Alexander Duff Robertson was born on April 28,1926, in Dunkfield, England. He received an M.B. from the University of Edinburgh in 1949, a D.P.H. from the University of London in 1955, and an M.D. from the University of Saskatchewan in 1961.</p>
         <p>At the University of Edinburgh, Robertson was a researcher in social medicine (1941-1951), a lecturer in public health and social medicine, and a lecturer in the general practice teaching unit (1951-1954). From 1955 to 1958, he was a lecturer in social and preventive medicine at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London and in public health at the London School of Hygiene and Topical Medicine.</p>
         <p>In 1958, Robertson became head of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan where he remained until accepting the executive directorship of the Milbank Memorial Fund in New York City in 1962. During his time at the Milbank Memorial Fund, he launched and developed the Milbank Faculty Fellowship which impacted the development of social medicine. From 1969 until 1990, he worked in several capabilities for the World Health Organization (WHO) beginning with the position of chief of human resources in the Caribbean for two years. From 1972 to 1973, he served as regional advisor for medical education and public health; public health administrator; director of health manpower development; and, finally, as the director of health services in the regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean in Alexandria, Egypt. In 1983, he moved to Geneva, where he was the program manager for staff development and training for WHO until 1986. From 1986 to 1990, he served as special advisor to the director general of WHO for the occupied Arab Territories, including Palestine.</p>
         <p>Robertson also held part-time academic positions as a lecturer in Public Health andAdministrative Medicine from 1963 until 1971 at Columbia University and as a lecturer in Public Health (International Health) at Yale University from 1966 to 1971. His publications focused on medical education, community medicine, and social science as related to medicine. He served on numerous boards and at times as an officer in the public sector. He was a leading figure in the field of modern public health especially in the development of health services in the United States. He died on June 29, 1991.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically within the following sections: Early years; the University of Saskatchewan; the Milbank Memorial Fund; and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
               <p>The correspondence primarily documents Alexander Robertson's professional contact with physicians, public health educators and administrators, and professional organizations. The correspondence focuses on the day-to-day operation of each organization such as travel plans, scheduling of meetings, and summary of meetings with staff. A significant amount of the correspondence are copies of his letters. The series includes a substantial amount of correspondence with Maurice Backett, John Brotherston, Mac Dowling, Sheila Hart, J. M. MacIntosh, G. McKerracher, Samuel Milbank, Frederick Mott, and Sam Wolfe.</p>
               <p>The correspondence of the University of Saskatchewan years is dominated by his administrative responsibilities connected with the running of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine. Also, the correspondence documents issues associated with the Canadian Public Health Association, of which he was chairman from 1960-1961. While at the Milbank Memorial Fund, his correspondence reflects the activities he dealt with on a day-to-day basis in his role as its executive director. There are three folders of correspondence with Samuel Milbank who was Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of the Milbank Memorial Fund. The correspondence highlights issues associated with the Health Research Council of New York City of which Robertson was a member from 1962 to 1969 and Mayor John Lindsay's Advisory Committee on Health Services in New York where he was chairman from 1966 to 1968. The majority of the correspondence focuses on WHO where he worked from 1972 to 1990. The correspondence reflects his administrative duties in the five positions he was assigned to in this organization.</p>

               <p>The series contains professional files that are arranged alphabetically by topical heading. The materials include memoranda, minutes, agendas, financial statements, and reports.</p>
               <p>T he majority of the folders contain information about the various public service organizations of which Robertson was a member during his career, especially when he worked in Saskatchewan and New York. During his time in Saskatchewan, he was involved with the Canadian Public Health Association, the Canadian Medical Association, and the College of General Practice of Canada. Folders filed under College of Physicians and Surgeons in Saskatchewan and the Canadian Labour Congress include speeches, writings, and press releases regarding the Canadian government's proposal on prepaid medical care. Organizations in New York included the Health Services Administration, the Piel Commission, the Health Research Council, and the Task Force on Reorganization of City Government.</p>
               <p>The remaining folders are related to the three institutions that define his professional career. There are six folders from the Milbank Memorial Fund focusing on a leadership resources survey and human resources development in the Caribbean. The World Health Organization(WHO) materials at the headquarters, in the Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Pan American Health Organization focus on issues such as a leadership survey and finance. From his time at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan, there are three folders of minutes of meetings as well as reports. Correspondence relating to these organizations can be found in Series I.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically into three sections: personal papers, photographs, and writings.</p>
               <p>The personal papers include award certificates, diplomas, resumes, and congratulatory telegrams and letters. Robertson's degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, from Union College in 1964 includes a statement describing him as "a pioneering integrator of the behavioral sciences with medicine." The five folders of photographs predominately depict scenes of conferences that Dr. Robertson attended during his career. There is one folder of portraits of Dr. Robertson. His writings include both published works and unpublished manuscripts regarding various issues on medical education, community medicine, and social science as related to medicine. Robertson's speeches comprise the largest portion of the series. They were delivered at a variety of academic, governmental, and international meetings. There are folders with his remarks at the Annual Convention of the Canadian Public Health Association in 1959, the thirty-fifth Anniversary Congress of the Pan American Medical Association in 1960, and the one hundred twenty-fifth celebration of the founding of the Albany Medical Center in 1964 to name a few. Oversize photographs, diplomas, and award certificates are filed at the end of the series.</p>
