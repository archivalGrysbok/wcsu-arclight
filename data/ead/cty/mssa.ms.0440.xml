The largest sections are those of Thomas Day Seymour, Charles Seymour (1885-1963), and Charles Seymour, Jr. The collection represents six generations of an intellectually and socially prominent family and through correspondence and diaries offers detailed evidence on social life and customs in New Haven, Hartford and nineteenth-century Ohio.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Seymour Family Papers is a collection of unusual quality which spans the years 1711 to 1969, with the greatest concentration occurring from 1870 to 1945. The papers represent six generations of an intellectually and socially prominent family which included two Yale presidents as well as teachers, lawyers, prep school head masters, a Civil War general, a newspaper editor, and a sculptor.</p>
         <p>The papers are rich in detail concerning social life and customs in New Haven, Hartford, and nineteenth century Ohio. Family members traveled extensively both professionally and for pleasure, and the papers contain interesting views of American travelers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Because these are family papers there is much in them dealing with daily family life, childbearing, and the role of women in the family, and because so many family members were teachers the papers will prove to be a fertile source for those interested in the history of education, particularly the histories of Yale University, Case Western Reserve University (at the time Western Reserve College), and Choate School.</p>
         <p>The papers came to Manuscripts and Archives through numerous donations from family members, the most recent gift being from Mrs. Charles Seymour, Jr. in 1979. The papers now include correspondence and other material of Charles Law Watkins, formerly MSS Group 657.</p>
         <p>The papers are divided into eighteen series with separate series for major family groups and individuals. All material pertaining to a married woman is filed under her married name, even if the material was generated prior to her marriage. The series are arranged as follows:</p>

         </list>
         <p>Each series contains a wide variety of material which may include correspondence, writings, legal and financial documents, printed material, and memorabilia. Only photographs have been segregated into a separate series.</p>
         <p>In all cases letters between family members are filed in the series of their recipient. Thus, the researcher will have to refer to two series to follow the correspondence between any two individuals. Whenever a letter is addressed to more than one person, it is placed with the series of the eldest addressee.</p>
         <p>At the beginning of each series is a description of the arrangement of that series. In most cases there is also a brief biographical sketch which will provide some insight into the interests of the particular family member and some suggestions as to the wide range of subjects that could be covered in the series.

         <p>1981 ADDITION</p>
         <p>4' (10 boxes), 1843-1933</p>
         <p>The Seymour Family Papers Add. 1981, housed in ten boxes and spanning the years from 1843 to 1933, was donated to Yale University in 1981 by Seymour St. John.</p>
         <p>The original collection is divided into eighteen series and this addition is arranged in the same manner as the larger collection. All correspondence, therefore, is filed in the series of the recipient of the letters. Letters written to Thomas Day Seymour, for example, are found in Series VII, while those written by him to other family members are located in the appropriate series. Please refer to the introductions to each series in the register to the Seymour Family Papers for additional information. The add. 1981 contains material for ten series, but the bulk of the correspondence and other papers are found in THOMAS DAY SEYMOUR, SARAH (HITCHCOCK) SEYMOUR, and ST. JOHN FAMILY.</p>
         <p>The add. 1981 fills several important gaps in the Seymour Family Papers. These papers focus on the family of Thomas Day Seymour. The chief correspondents and recipients of letters are Thomas Day Seymour, Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour, and their three children, Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, Clara Hitchcock (Seymour) St. John, and Charles Seymour (1885-1963).</p>
         <p>The single most important correspondent is Clara Hitchcock (Seymour) St. John. Clara's college years at Bryn Mawr are well documented. Letters written by Clara from college to her family fill folders 37-58 of Series VII. The correspondence covers her freshman, junior, and senior years at college. (Letters from her parents, sister Elizabeth, and brother Charles to her are found in Series X.) After graduation Clara and her sister travelled to Europe in the company of their uncle Charles Seymour (1843-1913). Sixty letters written by the two young women between June and September 1900 describe this exciting journey. See Series VII folders 11-12, 58-61. The same series also contains several letters written by Clara and her mother from Italy in 1903.</p>
         <p>Clara married George St. John in June 1906 and correspondence in Series VII folders 64-68, and Series VIII, folder 115, describes their honeymoon in pastoral New Hampshire and George's experiences teaching at the Adirondack-Florida School. In a letter to her parents written September 6, 1909 from Windsor, Vermont, Clara describes a visit to the home of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and recounts his problems designing a new $20 gold piece. The Adirondack-Florida School was located at Rainbow Lake in Franklin County, New York and Coconut Grove, Florida. The bride who was accustomed to the amenities of life had to adjust to living in a primitive cabin in the Adirondack woods. Moreover, when the headmaster became ill in early October, Clara took over his teaching assignments.</p>
         <p>In one particularly significant group of letters in Series VIII, folders 116-119, Clara St. John relates the difficulties endured by her first child, Elizabeth Seymour St. John, "Betty," in her first year. Although she weighed a healthy eight pounds at birth on August 3, 1908, Clara was unable to nurse the child and the infant suffered from severe adverse reactions to cow's milk, formula, medicines, and baby food. The baby weighed only 71/4 pounds at three months and her ordeal culminated with a bout of diphtheria in April 1909. (See Series IX, folder 148, and Series XI, folders 245-246 for additional material on this subject.)</p>
         <p>In addition to the extensive Clara Hitchcock (Seymour) St. John correspondence in Series VII, the same series contains two other important groups of letters. The Seymours' elder daughter, Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, taught Greek from 1901 to 1903 at Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio. Letters in folders 13-17 cover her activities for much of the 1902-1903 academic year. (Series VIII, folder 91, and Series X, folder 156, contain further Lake Erie College correspondence.) In letters written betwen 1892 and 1894 Thomas Day Seymour's colorful brother Charles discusses his financial activities, national politics, and his brother's children. Charles Seymour (1843-1903) held strong Republican views. In several letters he blasts the Democratic party for its mismanagement of the economy. "I stood the panic of '73," he asserts on November 14, 1892, "the broken leg, the grip[pe], and the nerve exhaustion that followed it last Spring, but the election news fairly knocks me out. I never dreamed that the liars and robbers would be able to deceive the entire body of the people." Bachelor Charles Seymour in a letter written on October 18, 1893 says that a college education for women was useless. He was also deeply pessimistic about the nation's future. He mourned the decline of "the Puritan stock" and advised his brother on February 7, 1894 to keep his namesake Charles Seymour (1885-1963) "out of doors." Due to Puritan decadence, "only those will survive who abolish intellectual stuffing" and follow the "manly sports."</p>
         <p>Series VIII SARAH (HITCHCOCK) SEYMOUR contains correspondence addressed to Thomas Day Seymour's wife, twelve folders of <emph render="italic">Hitchcock Family Papers,</emph> and a small amount of other papers. It has several interesting letters written by Charles Seymour (1885-1963) from Athens, Constantinople, and Munich in the summer of 1909. One ten page letter dated August 18 describes his journey from Constantinople to Munich. This series also includes a substantial group of letters of Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour's parents, brothers, and sister. Two brothers, John Ford and Henry Valentine Hitchcock, served in the Union armies. John Ford Hitchcock enlisted in September 1861 and served in the 18th U.S. Infantry of the Army of the Ohio. He was killed in battle, probably at Stones River on December 31, 1862. Several of his letters contain interesting commentaries on the military and political situations. Henry Valentine Hitchcock, John's older brother, enlisted in 1863 and became a chaplain. In one letter dated May 12, 1865, he discusses the reaction in North Carolina to President Lincoln's assassination. See folders 109-110 and 135-137. Several other Hitchcock letters, written by Sarah's parents, describe their trip to Europe in 1867-1868. The series also contains several folders of correspondence of school friends of Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour.</p>
         <p>Series X ST. JOHN FAMILY contains a large number of letters written to Clara (Seymour) St. John by her family and friends, folders 155-200, and a large group of letters addressed to Seymour St. John in 1928-1929 when he was attending the Insitut Carnal in Gstaad, Switzerland. The largest volume of correspondence in Series X covers Clara's Bryn Mawr years. The letters are personal and discuss normal mother and daughter, brother and sister, and school friend subjects. Clara's mother, for example, wrote about clothes, her social activities in New Haven, family doings, and news of friends and relatives. During her senior year at Bryn Mawr, Clara was "Chairman" of the De Rebus Club, which provided a forum for visiting speakers. She corresponded with potential speakers, including Jacob A. Riis and William Dean Howells, both of whom declined her invitation.</p>
         <p>Folders 201-220 contain letters written to Seymour St. John in 1928-1929 from family and friends. The most interesting are those from his mother and older brother George St. John, Jr. Clara (Seymour) St. John in a letter written December 12, 1928, for example, describes a dinner she and her husband attended at the home of Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon in Washington, D. C. The affair was also attended by President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge. Due to a social error, the St. Johns rode up on the elevator with the President and his wife, thus when the receiving line was formed, "Cal skipped us, with a laconic 'I believe I met you downstairs.'" The 1928 presidential election is alluded to in several letters, folders 204, 206, and 216.</p>
         <p>George St. John, Jr., called Jimmy, was at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge at the same time his younger brother was in Switzerland. George's letters give a good view of his activities at the English university, for his correspondence is filled with discussions of concerts, rowing, skating, bicycling, hockey, the food, and the weather. Indeed, the letters of all the boys show a preoccupation with sports, especially baseball and football.</p>
         <p>Henry Lawrence Hitchcock, Thomas Day Seymour, George St. John, and Charles Seymour (1885-1963) were all leaders in the field of education, yet little in this collection concerns their professional careers. The Seymour Family Papers Add. 1981 provides a good deal of documentation on the family of Thomas Day Seymour, in particular for Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour and Clara (Seymour) St. John, although there is also useful information on the Hitchcock family, Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel's teaching career, and the youth and early adulthood of Charles Seymour (1885-1963). The addition also contains letters written by a large number of Day and Hitchcock relatives. The correspondence is personal in character and should be of use primarily to researchers interested in family history or biography.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Nathan Perkins Seymour was born December 24, 1813, at Hartford, Connecticut. His parents were Charles Seymour, a prominent Hartford merchant, and his wife Catharine Perkins Seymour. Nathan Perkins Seymour attended the Hopkins Grammar School of Hartford and graduated from Yale University in the class of 1834. For two years he served as rector of the Hopkins Grammar School and then returned to Yale as a tutor. In 1840 he became chairman of the classics department at Western Reserve College in Hudson, Ohio, a post which he was to hold until 1870. On September 7, 1841, he married Elizabeth Day of Hartford.</p>
               <p>As a professor emeritus Seymour continued an active intellectual life. From 1870 until 1891 he delivered regular lectures at Western Reserve College, Lake Erie Seminary at Painesville, and at other schools in Ohio. Each spring from 1879 until 1891 he taught at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and in January and February, 1885, he was a guest lecturer on English literature at Yale.</p>
               <p>In 1890 Seymour accepted the offer of his younger son, Thomas Day Seymour, to move to New Haven and live with Thomas' family. However, Seymour's sojourn in New Haven was short. Just before Thanksgiving, 1891, he contracted influenza, suffered complications because of a fall on Christmas Eve, and died on December 28, 1891.</p>
               <p>Nathan Perkins Seymour's life revolved around his academic career and his family. Correspondence with family members includes discussions of his research and issues confronting the schools at which he taught, such as coeducation at Western Reserve College. One will also find material on the social life of Hartford and of Ohio, theories of child rearing, and descriptions of travel in the U.S., as well as general family matters. Letters to Thomas Day Seymour (in Series VII) are particularly numerous.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into four sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> contains letters addressed to Nathan Perkins Seymour, letters from Seymour to non-family members, and some correspondence between non-family members which came into Seymour's possession. In each of these sub-sections, the correspondence is arranged alphabetically by sender. Within each folder the letters are arranged chronologically. Of particular interest are Thomas Day Seymour's letters to his father wherein he discusses his scholarly work and travels as well as family life.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> consists of miscellaneous original writings and translations by Seymour.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material</emph> is made up of several small books and pamphlets owned by Seymour and copies of an obituary notice and memorial pamphlets which appeared shortly after his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Personal and Memorabilia</emph> consists of one folder containing account books, receipts, and bookplates.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Elizabeth (Day) Seymour was born February 16, 1816, the second of the eight children of Thomas and Sarah Coit Day of Hartford, Connecticut. She attended a series of private schools, including Catherine Beecher's Female Seminary. On September 7, 1841, she married Nathan Perkins Seymour, and in the years that followed they had four children: Charles (1843), Sarah Day (1845), Thomas Day (1848), and Harriet, who was born March 27, 1856, and lived for only two days.</p>
               <p>For fifty years Elizabeth made her home in Hudson, Ohio, though each year she made an extended trip to Hartford. When Western Reserve College moved to Cleveland (1881), Nathan was often away for days and weeks at a time, and Elizabeth, who found herself in a large empty house, became increasingly lonely and ill.</p>
               <p>In 1891 she and Nathan moved to join son Thomas in New Haven, but Nathan died within a few months. In the years following his death Elizabeth was often bedridden. She died September 7, 1900.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> is arranged alphabetically by sender, and chronologically within each folder.</p>
               <p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DAY FAMILY contains the papers of Elizabeth (Day) Seymour's parents, siblings, and of the siblings' children. (Other papers of the Day Family will be found in the Day Family Papers, MSS Group Number 175.) The parents, Thomas Day (1777-1855) and Sarah (Coit) Day (1786-1865), were married on March 18, 1813, and made Hartford, Connecticut, their permanent home. They had eight children. Thomas served from 1810-1835 as secretary of the state of Connecticut and from 1825-1833 as chief judge of the Hartford County Court.</p>
               <p>Two of the eight children achieved prominence in Hartford civic life. Sarah Coit (Day) Holley (1814-1899) married Connecticut's lieutenant governor, and soon to be governor, Alexander Hamilton Holley. Son Thomas Mills Day graduated from Yale College, studied law with his father, and published a digest of Connecticut law reports in 1840. From 1855-1865 he served as editor of the Hartford <emph render="italic">Courant</emph>.</p>
               <p>The series is divided into the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> is arranged alphabetically by recipient. For each recipient, the senders are in separate, alphabetically-arranged folders. Within each folder the material is in chronological order.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> consists of the memoirs of several members of the family, arranged alphabetically by author. Of particular interest is the memoir by Sarah (Day) Holley. In it she mentions her friendship with the Beecher family, the religious revival in Hartford in 1821, her introduction to Martin Van Buren, and the hard times of the economic slump in 1839. Catharine (Day) Andrews' memoir is especially rich for its views of nineteenth century Hartford.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Legal Records</emph> consists of a pair of legal documents of Jeremiah Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material.</emph> consists of two publications and an obituary.</p>

               <p>Charles Seymour (1843-1913) was the eldest child of Nathan Perkins and Elizabeth Day Seymour. He was born on December 20, 1843, in Hudson, Ohio, and lived there until his graduation from Western Reserve College in 1864. He then moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, and established a law practice. He specialized in real estate developments and represented large interests (often from other states and countries) who sought to develop the undeveloped frontier land of Tennessee.</p>
               <p>Like so many others in his family, Charles loved to travel. He visited most of the United States and was delighted that his business brought him to England twice each year. He greatly enjoyed taking his nieces and nephews with him on his trips abroad. It was he who arranged for the superb foreign education of his nephew and namesake, the future president of Yale University, Charles Seymour (1885-1963).</p>
               <p>In 1889 he was injured in a train wreck which left him lame. In time he returned to the round of business and travel. He suffered several heart attacks in the last years of his life and died April 12, 1913.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into two sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> contains all the letters addressed to Charles Seymour, arranged alphabetically by sender and chronologically within each folder. At the end of this section there is one letter from Charles Seymour to a cousin and a copy of a letter from a Mr. Mead to a Mr. McGuffey in which the former discussed the injuries sustained by Charles Seymour in a train wreck in Tennessee in 1889.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material</emph> consists of an advertisement and a document on farm leases.</p>

               <p>Thomas Day Seymour was born April 1, 1848, in Hudson, Ohio and spent his boyhood there. In 1864 at the age of sixteen, he worked for a few months on the <title render="italic">
                     Hartford Courant
                  </title> with his uncle, the editor, Thomas Mills Day. Responding to a notice in the <title render="italic">
                     Courant
                  </title> he, in January, 1865, joined the U.S. Christian Commission. Serving with this group dedicated to the preaching of religion and the teaching of reading to blacks in the U.S. Army, he witnessed the fall of Richmond in April. (See: MSS Group Number 619 for Confederate relics gathered by him.)</p>
               <p>Thomas Day Seymour returned to Hudson and attended Western Reserve College from 1866 until 1870, when he graduated first in his class. Having decided to devote his career to the classics, he went to Germany and for the next two years studied in Leipzig and Berlin. In the spring of 1872 he took the first of several trips to Greece. That autumn he returned to Hudson to take up the position of professor of Greek, a position he held until 1880 when he moved to New Haven to become Hillhouse Professor of Greek Language and Literature at Yale University.</p>
               <p>Thomas Day Seymour was a scholar of some reputation, a popular teacher, and an industrious administrator. A fine American Homeric scholar, he published many articles and several books. He served as an editor of the <title render="italic">
                     Classical Review
                  </title> and, beginning in 1903, as president of the Archaeological Institute of America. He was a founder of the American School at Athens and made numerous trips abroad to visit archaeological expeditions in Greece and the Middle East. His primary work, <title render="italic">
                     Life in the Homeric Age
                  </title>, was published just weeks before his death in 1907.</p>
               <p>In 1874 Thomas Day Seymour married Sarah Hitchcock, and they had three children: Elizabeth (Seymour) Angel, Clara (Seymour) St. John, and Charles Seymour (1885-1963).</p>
               <p>This series is divided into the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> consists of the letters addressed to Thomas Day Seymour alone or in conjunction with his wife and/or any of his children, from Seymour to non-family members and family members not represented in separate series, and letters to others from others which came into Seymour's possession.

               <p>Sarah Melissa (Hitchcock) Seymour was born September 27, 1846, in Columbus, Ohio. She was the daughter of Rev. Henry Lawrence Hitchcock, president of Western Reserve College, and Clarissa Mary Sophia (Ford) Hitchcock. A graduate of Lake Erie Seminary, "Sadie" married Thomas Day Seymour, then a young classics professor at Western Reserve College, on July 2, 1874. In Hudson, Ohio, Sadie gave birth to their two daughters, Elizabeth (known as Beth) Day (1876) and Clara Hitchcock (1880).</p>
               <p>Not long after Clara's birth, the family moved to New Haven, Connecticut. In 1885 a son, Charles, was born. In 1891 the family was joined by Thomas' parents, but this domestic arrangement was short lived; in December Nathan Perkins Seymour contracted influenza and died. Sadie continued to care for her mother-in-law until Elizabeth's death in 1900.</p>
               <p>A short time after the death of her mother-in-law, Sadie embarked on a long trip to Ohio and Indiana to visit family and friends and her <emph render="italic">alma mater</emph>. Freed from family obligations Sadie learned to love traveling. In 1901 Sadie accompanied Thomas to England, Switzerland, and Scotland, where he represented Yale at the 450th anniversary of Glasgow University. Heartened by this experience, Thomas and Sadie made plans for an extended stay in Europe. In January, Sadie and Clara sailed for Europe and spent many weeks traveling through Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and France. Joined by Thomas two months later, the family remained in Europe through August. The entire family was reunited in England for a visit with Charles.</p>
               <p>The next five years brought happy changes in the family with Charles close by as a student in Yale College and Clara's marriage in 1906. 1907 though proved to be a year of illness and tragedy. In February Sadie and her sister-in-law, Sarah Parsons, set out to visit Clara in Florida. They arrived to find that Clara was showing the first symptoms of what proved to be typhoid fever. Sadie brought Clara back to New Haven to recover, but during the summer Charles, too, was stricken with typhoid. Just before Thanksgiving Thomas fell ill with pneumonia, grew steadily worse, and died on the last day of the year.</p>
               <p>Sadie continued to live quietly with Beth. They moved to a smaller house and spent some time abroad. When Beth married English sculptor John Angel, Sadie accompanied her to London for the wedding and then lived with the couple. She shared with them the problems of wartime life and the birth, on March 21, 1915, of their son. One year and one day later, Sadie died.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> contains letters addressed to Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour alone or in conjunction with her children, and from Mrs. Seymour to non-family members. In both sub-sections the material is arranged alphabetically by sender, and chronologically within each folder.</p>
               <p>Of particular interest are the letters Sadie wrote for the round robin newsletter with classmates. Each year when the round robin arrived, Sadie would remove the letter she had written the previous year and would substitute a new one. Fortunately, she kept many of these letters, which chronicle family events and travels, and her own interests, activities, and reading. Also of note are letters from daughters Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel and Clara (Seymour) St. John concerning their experiences at Bryn Mawr College. There are in addition many letters from husband Thomas relaying to Sadie the happenings in New Haven and at Yale while she was absent traveling.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> is composed of one folder containing an account by Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour of her husband's final illness.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material</emph> consists of one folder of clippings from British and American newspapers.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Personal and Memorabilia</emph> contains one folder of receipts and another of invitations.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Hitchcock Family Papers</emph>consists of six folders of correspondence of members of the Hitchcock family and one folder of printed material. The material is arranged alphabetically by the names of family members.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, Thomas Day and Sarah Hitchcock Seymour's first child, was born in the Hudson, Ohio, home of the grandmother for whom she was named. From an early age Elizabeth, known as Beth, exhibited great intelligence and enthusiam for learning.</p>
               <p>In 1893 she graduated from Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Connecticut, and passed the entrance examinations for Yale. While there was no possibility that she might enter the all-male university, it was necessary for her to pass the examination for Yale or Harvard in order to be accepted at Bryn Mawr College. Beth, like her father, loved classics and at Bryn Mawr she majored in Greek. When she graduated in June 1897 she received both the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees.</p>
               <p>Following graduation, Beth lived at home with her parents and studied at the Yale Art School. During the summer of 1900 she and Clara accompanied their uncle Charles Seymour to Europe. From 1901 until 1903 Beth taught Greek at Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, the school her mother attended. When poor health forced her to give up teaching permanently, she returned home to live with her parents.</p>
               <p>In 1912 Beth went abroad alone. While she was in Greece she met the promising English sculptor John Angel. Two years later, on April 25, 1914, they were married in London. On March 21, 1915, she gave birth to a son, John Lawrence Angel. A second son, Henry Seymour Angel, was born in 1919.</p>
               <p>In 1925 Beth and her family moved to the United States, where John was commissioned to do a great deal of work for the St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York City. More American work followed, most notably the six bronze doors of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. After living for a while in New York City, the family moved to Sandy Hook, Connecticut. This remained their home until Beth's death on January 6, 1942. John stayed on there until his own death eighteen years later.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into two sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> consists of letters addressed to Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, which are arranged alphabetically by sender. Substantial letters from Sarah (Hitchcock) Seymour convey impressions of daily life in New Haven's academic community.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Personal and Memorabilia</emph> consists of quotations collected by Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, clippings about John Angel, and miscellaneous material such as invitations and Bryn Mawr College forms. There is also a small painting of a woman, possibly Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel, which may have been painted by John Angel.</p>

               <p>Clara Hitchcock (Seymour) St. John was born March 28, 1880, in her grandfather's home in Hudson, Ohio. She attended New Haven's public schools, entered Bryn Mawr at the age of sixteen, and graduated <emph render="italic">summa cum laude</emph> in 1900. That summer her uncle Charles Seymour took Clara and her sister to Europe for three months. Upon her return, Clara undertook the running of her parents' household to relieve her mother. During this period she assisted her father in the preparation of his books, <title render="italic">
                     Plato, Apology and Crito
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Life in the Homeric Age
                  </title>; she also published an anthology of her own, <title render="italic">
                     Masterpieces of Greek Literature
                  </title>, in 1902. In 1903, she traveled several months with her family in England and on the Continent.</p>
               <p>On June 23, 1906, Clara married George Clair St, John, a Harvard graduate then teaching English at the Adirondack-Florida School. As its name implies, this school spent part of the year in the Adirondacks and then transported students and faculty alike to Coconut Grove, Florida, for the winter. In the first months of her marriage, Clara gamely accompanied George on this trek. The harrowing experience of Clara's bout with typhoid fever persuaded George to secure employment less removed from civilization, and he accepted a position with the Hackley School. In 1908 he was appointed headmaster of the Choate School, a position he held until his retirement.</p>
               <p>Clara and George had four children: Elizabeth Seymour (1908), George Clair, Jr. (1910), Seymour (1912), and Francis Cushman (1916). Clara's talent for mothering extended beyond her own family to include the boys at Choate. For half a century, both St. Johns exerted a profound influence upon hundreds of outstanding young men who went on to positions of power and success.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into the following sections.</p>
               <p>

The section contains many letters from Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel describing married life and child rearing in Britain during World War I.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> consists of a small volume of poetry by Elizabeth Seymour St. John and unpublished poems by Clara St. John.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material</emph> consists of memorials to Clara St. John and Francis Cushman St. John, obituaries of George St. John, and one folder of miscellaneous printed material.</p>

               <p>Charles Seymour (1885-1963) was born in New Haven on January 1, 1885. After graduating from Hillhouse High School in 1901, he spent the next three years studying at King's College, Cambridge University and traveling throughout Great Britain and the Continent. He then returned to this country and entered Yale, which awarded him a second bachelor of arts degree in 1904. Immediately taking up his graduate work in history, Charles studied at the University of Freiburg, the Sorbonne, Cambridge University, and Yale, which awarded him the doctorate in history in 1911.</p>
               <p>On May 4 of that year he married Gladys Marion Watkins of Scranton, Pennsylvania, who was the sister of his Yale classmate, Charles Law Watkins. After a honeymoon in Europe, Charles Seymour began his teaching career at Yale.</p>
               <p>As World War I drew to a close, he joined the Inquiry, the group of "experts" recruited by Colonel Edward M. House to prepare for the expected peace conference. He was then selected to attend the conference in Paris and was appointed chief of the Austro-Hungarian Division.</p>
               <p>In the following years Charles Seymour returned to his teaching and writing. He edited <title render="italic">
                     The Intimate Papers of Colonel House
                  </title>, spent a year as an exchange professor in Belgium in 1924, and became curator of the House papers, which the Colonel had donated to the Yale University Library.</p>
               <p>In 1927 Charles Seymour was appointed provost of the university, and in 1937 he succeeded James Rowland Angell as president of Yale, a post he held until 1950.</p>
               <p>He devoted his retirement years to overseeing the administration of the House Collection, writing, and traveling. He died August 11, 1963.</p>
               <p>This series contains Charles Seymour's personal and family papers. For the papers he accumulated in his capacity as president of Yale University see: YRG 2A15; for the material relating to his career as an historian and curator of the House Collection see: MSS Group 441.</p>
               <p>Series XI consists of the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> is divided into Correspondence to Charles Seymour and Correspondence from Charles Seymour to others. The material is arranged alphabetically by correspondent, and chronologically within each folder. The section includes many interesting letters from Elizabeth Day (Seymour) Angel describing her travels and her daily routine in England during World War I. There is also a long series of letters from George St. John from Choate including one in 1960 containing his special insights about Choate graduate John F. Kennedy. Daughter Elizabeth Atwater Seymour also wrote frequently, and her letters provide accounts of life in Washington, the Federal Arts Project, the housing problems during World War II, and her experiences in O.S.S. Later letters, after she had returned to New Haven, contain descriptions of social and political happenings from the point of view of a Stevenson Democrat in a Republican family.</p>

               <p>Gladys (Watkins) Seymour was the only daughter of Thomas Hamer and Elizabeth (Law) Watkins of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Gladys was educated at Rosemary Hall and in Paris. On May 4, 1911, she married Charles Seymour. They had three children: Charles, Jr. (1912), Elizabeth Atwater (1914), and Sarah (1920).</p>
               <p>Gladys proved to be the perfect partner for her husband's endeavors. Her gaity and charm endeared her to his family, friends, colleagues, and students. During the years of his presidency of Yale she became known for her skills as a hostess and her interest and concern for the students.</p>
               <p>Sadly, Gladys Seymour outlived her husband and all three of her children. She died in 1978.</p>

               <p>Thomas Hamer Watkins was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on May 18, 1860. He married Elizabeth Cornelia Law, and they had two children, Charles Law Watkins and Gladys (Watkins) Seymour. He was president of the coal company, T.H. Watkins and Company, from which position he dealt with early coal unions. In 1902 he served on the Anthracite Coal Strike Commission. On occasion he was invited to dinner at Theodore Roosevelt's White House.</p>
               <p>His son followed him into the coal business. Charles Law Watkins, called "Law", was born on February 11, 1886, in Peckville, Pennsylvania. After graduation from Yale University he went to California where he worked for a year at the Stone Cañon Consolidated Coal Company. In 1910, he returned to Pennsylvania and set up the Watkins Coal Company, serving as its president until 1916 when he enlisted in the French Ambulance Corps. He later served at the front with the French Artillery Corps and was awarded the "Croix de Guerre".</p>
               <p>While in France he met Marie Mathilde Bader. They were subsequently married and returned to the United States in March, 1919. Until his retirement "Law" served as vice president of the Pennsylvania Coal and Coke Company. He and Marie had four children. In 1929 "Law" assumed the position of Associate Director of the Phillips Memorial Art Gallery in Washington, D.C. He died on March 31, 1945.</p>
               <p>The WATKINS - LAW FAMILIES series now includes papers from former MSS Group 657, the Charles Law Watkins Papers. The series is arranged in the following sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> consists of letters addressed to various members of the Watkins and Law families, arranged alphabetically by recipient and, for each recipient, alphabetically by sender. Within each folder the material is arranged chronologically.</p>
               <p>There are numerous letters from Gladys (Watkins) Seymour to each of her parents. The letters are full of description of dances, dinners, and other events of high society. Both Charles and Gladys Seymour wrote giving their impressions of the Paris Peace Conference. Also of interest in this section are letters from Charles Law Watkins containing descriptions of student life at Yale, illustrated chronicles from his California years showing the formation of a railroad and operation of a coal mine, and highly detailed accounts of his experiences as an ambulance driver on the front line in France in 1916.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> consists of one folder of pamphlets and poetry by Charles Law Watkins, which reflect his attitude towards war.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Printed Material</emph> contains only an obituary and a memorial for Charles Law Watkins.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Personal and Memorabilia</emph> consists of miscellaneous material such as calling, luncheon, dinner and dance cards, ships passenger lists, and receipts.</p>

               <p>Elizabeth Atwater Seymour, Charles and Gladys Seymour's middle child, attended Rosemary Hall and Le Cours Maintenon in Cannes, France, and spent a year in Paris studying French literature and art.</p>
               <p>She settled in Washington, D.C., where she worked at Studio House, which was connected with the Phillips Memorial Gallery. She later became assistant director of the Federal Arts Project, the arts section of the Works Progress Administration.</p>
               <p>During World War II, Elizabeth, known as Betsey, worked with the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, North Africa (where she was part of the original O.S.S. contingent which arrived just after the Allied landing), and Europe.</p>
               <p>After the war, Betsey returned to New Haven, where she lived with her parents. She worked for a time on the secretarial and administrative staff of the Veterans Administration Hospital in West Haven, then became secretary to Judge Thomas W. Swan of the Second U.S. District Court. She died the day before her birthday, on February 9, 1969.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into three sections.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Sarah (Seymour) Howard, the youngest of Charles and Gladys Seymour's three children, was born July 4, 1920. Like her sister Betsey, Sarah, known as Sally, attended Le Cours Maintenon, Cannes, France. She graduated from the Westover School in 1938 and Vassar College in 1942.</p>
               <p>On September 25, 1942, Sally married James Merriam Howard, Jr., a senior at Yale. Three months later Jim Howard enlisted as a private in the U.S. Marine Corps. In March of 1943 he was commissioned a second lieutenant. During the period of his training Sally, like so many other war brides, traveled to be near the places he was stationed. He was eventually sent overseas to the South Pacific but returned to the United States in time for the birth of their son James M. Howard, III (Jerry) on March 19, 1944.</p>
               <p>The young Howard family moved to New Jersey where Jim had obtained a position teaching English at the Lawrenceville School. Early in December, 1945, Sally contracted infantile paralysis and died.</p>
               <p>Jerry Howard lived with his maternal grandparents until his father's marriage in 1949 to Selena Tatlock. Jim Howard remained at Lawrenceville until 1954, when he accepted the post of headmaster of Blair Academy, in Blairstown, New Jersey.</p>
               <p>This short series is divided into three sections.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> contains letters to Sarah (Seymour) Howard, which are arranged alphabetically by sender and chronologically within each folder. There are also letters to others from her son, James Merriam Howard, III. These are arranged alphabetically by recipient and chronologically within each folder.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> consists of one story composed by Sarah (Seymour) Howard when she was a child.</p>
