         <p>The Woodruff family was one of the founding families of Litchfield, Connecticut. The principals represented in the papers include: George Caitlin Woodruff (1805-1885), George Morris Woodruff (1836-1990), Charles Hornblower Woodruff (1836-1915), and Lewis Bartholomew Woodruff (1868-1925), all of whom attended Yale University, and their spouses from the Bowne and Parsons families of Flushing, New York.</p>
         <p>GEORGE CATLIN WOODRUFF, 1805-1885</p>
         <p>George Catlin Woodruff, eldest son of Gen. Morris Woodruff and Candace (Catlin) Woodruff, was born in Litchfield (South Farms, now Morris), Conn., December 1, 1805.</p>
         <p>After graduating he studied law under Judge Gould at the Litchfield Law School, and was admitted to the bar in September, 1827. After visiting Pennsylvania and Eastern Connecticut for the purpose of selecting a place for business, he returned to Litchfield, where he remained in the practice of his profession till his death, holding many positions of trust and responsibility. He was a member of the State Legislature in the years 1851, 1866, and 1874, and Representative of the Fourth Congressional District of Connecticut in the 37th Congress. He died at his home in Litchfield, after a brief illness, November 21, 1885, in the 80th year of his age.</p>
         <p>On September 28, 1829, he married Henrietta S. Seymour, sister of the late Chief Justice Origen S. Seymour (Y.C. 1824), who survives him. By her he had two children, a daughter who died in infancy and a son, George M. Woodruff (Y.C. 1857), who is still living.</p>
         <p>Mr. Woodruff's only literary undertaking was a brief History of Litchfield, published in 1845 (64 pp. 8vo), of characteristic accuracy and thoroughness. In his professional relations he was notable for the clearness and solidity of his reasoning, and no less for the absolute integrity which governed his actions.</p>

         <p>CHARLES HORNBLOWER WOODRUFF, B.A. 1858</p>
         <p>Born October 1, 1836, in Newark, N.J. Died May 4, 1915, in Litchfield, Conn.</p>
         <p>Charles Hornblower Woodruff was born on October 1, 1836, in Newark, N.J., the son of Lewis Bartholomew Woodruff (B.A. 1830, LL.D. Columbia 1860). The latter's parents were General Morris Woodruff, a descendant of Nathaniel Woodruff, one of the first settlers of the town of Litchfield, Conn., and of Matthew Woodruff, one of the eighty-four original proprietors of Farmingont, and Candace, daughter of Lewis Catlin of Harwinton, Conn., one of whose ancestors was Thomas Catlin, an early settler of Hartford. His mother was Harriette Burnet, daughter of Chief Justice Joseph Coerten Hornblower of New Jersey and Mary (Burnet) Hornblower. He entered Yale from Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., and in college was a member of Linonia.</p>
         <p>His preparation for the law, which he had decided to follow as a profession, was received at Harvard, where he spent the academic year of 1859-1860, and at Columbia, from which he was graduated with the degree of LL.B. In 1861. He also receieved the honorary degree of M.A. From Yale in 1865.</p>
         <p>He was admitted to the bar of New York in May, 1861, and after spending part of the folowing autumn in an office, began practice in New York City on January 1, 1862. For six years he was associated with his father and Charles F. Sanford (B.A. 1847), an uncle of his wife, subsequently judge of the Superior Court of New York, under the firm name of Sanford &amp; Woodruff. Upon the withdrawl of the elder Woodruff, upon his appointment as a judge of the Court of Appeals of New York State, Mr. Edward Randolph Robinson joined the firm, which became Sanford, Robinson &amp; Woodruff, and with which Mr. Woodruff continued until 1875. From that time he practiced independently until 1896; then with his son Frederick, until 1902, when he retired.</p>
         <p>He was until his death a member of the Bar Association in the City of New York, and belonged to the Society of the Cincinnati in New Jersey, the Society of Colonial Wars, the New England Society, and the Sons of the Revolution, all of the state of New York, being for many years on the board of managers of the latter organization. He was the first president of the Phillips Academy Alumni Association in New York, and had long served as an elder in the Collegiate Reformed Dutch Church of that city. He had traveled to quite an extent both in this country and abroad.</p>
         <p>In recent years, Mr. Woodruff had spent much of his time in Litchfield, Conn., where he had long had a summer home, and where his death occurred, from a cerebral hemorrhage, on May 4, 1915. Interment was in the East Cemetary in Litchfield.</p>
         <p>His marriage took place on June 30, 1863, in New Haven, Conn., to Catherine Gertrude Laing, daughter of William Elihu and Margaret Louise (Craney) Sanford, who survives him with two of their sons: Lewis Bartholomew, a graduate of the College in 1890 and of the New York Law School in 1892, and Frederick Sanford, who took a B.A. at Yale in 1892. Their oldest son died at birth, and the deaths of the two youngest,—Charles Hornblower, Jr., who was a non-graduate member of the Class of 1896, and Edward Seymour, a graduate of the College in 1899 and of the School of Forestry in1907,—occurred within a month of each other in 1909. Mr. Woodruff's brother, Morris, was a member of the Class of 1860, and the latter's two sons,—Morris and George W.L.,—also graduated from Yale, the former with the degree of B.A. In 1893 and the latter with that of Ph.B. In 1895.</p>
