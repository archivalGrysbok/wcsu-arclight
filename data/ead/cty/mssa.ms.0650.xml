The materials were primarily created by photographer Andrew St. George and filmmaker David C. Stone. St. George's photographs provide extensive documentation of the 26th of July Movement from 1957 to 1959, and of Fidel Castro during his first year as prime minister. The films created by David C. Stone in 1969 include footage of the Vento School, Juventud Comunista, Turcios Lima Labor Brigade, Urbano Noris sugar mill, and orientadores rurales. The footage was incorporated into Compañeras y Compañeros, a 1970 documentary produced by David C. Stone, Barbara Stone, and Adolfas Mekas, a copy of which is in the collection. There are outtakes of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation film from 1964 of scenes of Havana and Santiago and interviews with Fidel Castro, students, cabaret performers, and a female lieutenant in the revolutionary armed forces. The collection also includes a small amount of papers, some of which were compiled by Andrew St. George, including a manuscript notebook of an interview of Fidel Castro by St. George, medallions and ribbons from the 26th of July Movement, and miscellaneous printed materials.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Comprised of approximately 5,000 photographs and 60 unedited films shot in Cuba between 1957 and 1969, the Cuban Revolution Collection is primarily the product of two filmmakers, Andrew St. George and David C. Stone. Their works were purchased in 1969 and 1970 by the Antillean Research Program at Yale University. Directed by history and sociology professor Anthony Maingot, the program primarily focused on the comparative study of Cuba and Haiti. It was funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation that was overseen at Yale by anthropologist Sydney Mintz, Spanish literature professor José Juan Arrom, and others. Although not originally intended for acquisition of library or research materials, Maingot convinced members of the board overseeing the Program, including Mintz, of the unique research value of the St. George and Stone materials. The board then agreed to purchase the two collections for future researchers.</p>
         <p>According to Maingot, St. George contacted him in early 1969 with the offer to donate his collection of photographs and provide "captions" or descriptions of the images in exchange for a fee of $5,000. His reason for doing so, as he explained to Maingot, was financial need. Having worked for most of his life as a free-lance photojournalist, St. George enjoyed the political and ideological freedom that his work gave him, but sometimes found himself without regular sources of income. Despite the insistence of Maingot and Sterling Library's Latin American Curator Lee Williams, St. George was only able to complete the descriptions for two of the nine contact books comprising his set of photographs. He did, however, visit Yale in the fall of 1969 and provide an oral narrative that explained the outtakes of films he took during three of six visits he made to Fidel Castro's guerrilla forces in the Sierra Maestra between 1957 and 1959. Included in the collection is a voice recording of St. George describing the scenes in these films and identifying many of the individuals that they feature.</p>
         <p>In 1970, Maingot received a separate invitation from David C. Stone to visit his studio in New York City, view samples of recently shot footage of Cuba's revolutionary society and consider purchasing his films for Yale. Maingot quickly accepted the invitation. Maingot respected Stone for his many previous films, all of which were critically acclaimed. He knew, however, that Stone's recent film, "Compañeras and Compañeros" (1970) had been a failure, both financially and according to the critics, and had received only scant attention when it first premiered at a small art theatre in New York City a few months earlier. Stone was anxious to sell the collection, admitting that he needed to recover the investment that he had made in shooting the film over an eight-month period in Cuba. Stone originally asked Maingot for $13,000, a sum at which Mintz and others balked when Maingot presented the figure for consideration. All parties eventually agreed to offer Stone the same amount that St. George had received. In Stone's case, it was considered an outright "purchase" and unlike St. George, Stone was not required to provide any written materials explaining the nature of his films, their content or context.</p>
         <p>Until 2005 when the Seaver Institute provided a grant for the digitization of the images and films and preparation of accurate descriptions of them, the vast majority of the collection's photographs remained unused and its films never seen. Aside from the difficulties that researchers encountered when attempting to use the poorly identified materials, the image contact sheets and reel-to-reel 16 mm films with separate sound recordings were fragile. With the Seaver Institute grant, the images and films were digitized and Lillian Guerra, Yale University Assistant Professor of History and Cuba specialist, and Jorge Macle Cruz, vice director of research at Cuba's National Archive, collaborated to write detailed descriptions of the materials for the inventory.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Research Value of the Collection</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Archival sources in Cuba for the study of the Cuban Revolution are extremely rare and accessibility to them is almost entirely restricted to officials of the Cuban government. Archival sources in the United States are primarily government records pertaining to the Bay of Pigs invasion and various congressional hearings held on national security matters in the Caribbean. This collection, therefore, provides rare visual and textual documentation of the everyday realities of the armed struggle in Cuba during the height of the war against Batista and during the most ideal phase of the Revolution itself from 1959 to 1969. While primarily comprised of St. George and Stone's own work, the collection also includes a rich series of 1954 film outtakes from the Canadian Broadcasting Company that were purchased by Maingot. Together, the materials provide a spectrum of popular voices and reactions to the Cuban government's gradual ideological evolution toward the unique form of Communism for which it became known by the late 1960s. Eventually it was replaced by a Soviet-style model of Communism based on economic central planning and top-down forms of political control (institutionalized formally in Cuba's revolutionary Constitution of 1976). The form of Communism that the films in the collection reveal, however, was one dominated by the state's use of moral rather than material incentives in rewarding citizens' labor and an official focus on the voluntary transformation in the consciousness of citizens to collective rather than individual goals.</p>
         <p>Because St. George was never professionally trained as a photographer and enjoyed writing much more than picture-making, the enormous quantity of photographs that make up his body of work from the period 1957-1960 reflects a desire to document the Revolution through the creation of dense and interlocking visual narratives. Thus, St. George often took hundreds of photographs of an event from every possible angle, enabling the researcher to chart the course of a mass demonstration, for instance, from the early morning hours in which massive crowds began to gather in the Plaza of the Revolution, to late in the night when the rally culminated with one of Fidel Castro's famously long speeches. Highlights of St. George's materials include hundreds of images documenting life among the guerrillas and urban underground before 1959 and the trial and execution of Batista's war criminals from January through February 1959. Also featured are hundreds of images documenting Fidel's trip to the United States in April 1959; Cuba's first May Day rally in 1959; the first formal visit of the Soviet Vice Premier to Cuba in February 1960; the visit of Indonesia's nationalist leader Sukarno in March 1960; and nationalizations of foreign oil company properties in 1960. St. George also recorded subtle transformations of the political landscape that took place as the government and the Cuban Communist Party allied with each other in early 1960 and began spreading propaganda through such means as the painting of walls and posting of public signs.</p>
         <p>Like St. George's early revolutionary photographs and pre-1959 films, David Stone's uncut 1969 films feature scenes shot from virtually every angle of Cuba's revolutionary society. They include a literature class at a government boarding school, an indoctrination session led by once illiterate peasants-turned-political-instructors, an electoral assembly of the Communist Youth, and a celebration of volunteer cane workers in the now infamous 1970 Ten Million Ton Sugar Harvest. Ranging from actual scenes to those that were staged, these visual narratives document the "utopia" of revolution, as well as its authoritarian values, contradictions and internal conflicts. These films bear witness to the events their creators and subjects meant them to depict while also serving as independent, eyewitness accounts of an historic period in Cuban history.</p>
         <p>Andrew St. George and David Stone had entirely different political views. St. George was an avowed anti-Communist whose desire to be free of personal political compromise led him to refuse to become a citizen of the United States, despite the fact that he lived there for over fifty years of his life. Even though St. George clearly admired Fidel Castro, he remained highly suspicious of the concentration of power in Fidel's person that the revolutionaries' rise to power quickly brought. He also disdained the political culture forged in the early months of the Revolution that encouraged unconditional loyalty to the regime and seemed to automatically attack critics as counterrevolutionaries. By contrast, David Stone was a committed Marxist who admired the Cuban Revolution. He recognized that going to Cuba during the most explosive phase of international protests against the United States' role in the Vietnam War represented an opportunity to condemn United States imperialism in all its forms. Stone believed that the Revolution's uncompromising defense of Cuba's national sovereignty made any internal evidence of authoritarianism immaterial. He viewed Cuba as the one Latin American society that had successfully managed to resist United States pressures at the height of the cold war. Stone and St. George's works complement each other, therefore, because of the divergent experiences, assumptions and expectations that informed their creation.</p>

         <p>Born in Hungary in 1923, Andrew St. George was a highly educated man who spoke eight languages. Although he attended Columbia University in the 1950s, he never graduated, preferring to find work as a writer and photojournalist in order to support his young wife and frequent collaborator, Jean, and their growing family. A staunch anti-Communist who disdained affiliations with political organizations of any kind, St. George worked for United States military intelligence in Vienna after World War II. According to his wife, he also collaborated with Raoul Gustav Wallenberg, the Swedish businessman who used his diplomatic post as head of the Swedish Legation in Hungary to save tens of thousands of Jews targeted for extermination by the Nazis in the final years of the World War II.</p>
         <p>St. George was inspired by Herbert Matthew's historic<title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Times
            </title> report in February 1957 on Fidel Castro's guerrillas that contradicted official reports of their deaths at the hands of Cuban government forces. He immediately set about looking for a way to get to the Sierra Maestra and render a more thorough view of happenings there. Armed with an advance of only a few hundred dollars, as well as photographic and recording equipment, St. George quickly fulfilled his hopes and became the author of one of the first full-length interviews conducted with Fidel Castro and his guerrillas in the Sierra Maestra during the fall of 1957. Published in the February 1958 edition of<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Look
            </title> magazine, the article featured never-before-seen images that documented guerrilla life and provided evidence for the kind of authority that the 26th of July Movement commanded among peasants in Cuba's far-eastern region. Among admirers of the piece was Fidel Castro himself. He personally contacted St. George through the Civic Resistance Movement's New York City-based headquarters, directed by Mario Llerena, and invited him to make subsequent trips to the Sierra Maestra. In all, St. George made six trips to the Sierra Maestra, staying and living with the rebels for close to seven months. Additionally, St. George was one of only two journalists to accompany Fidel Castro as he and his forces descended from the mountains of Oriente to declare victory in Santiago de Cuba and proceeded by caravan on a long, seven-day victory march to Havana. For his work on behalf of the Revolution, Fidel Castro awarded St. George the same gold medal he presented to Herbert Matthews during his first trip to the United States in April 1959 as Prime Minister of Cuba. In addition to the article in<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Look
            </title> magazine, St. George also published firsthand accounts of his time with the guerrillas before and after the fall of Fulgencio Batista in such magazines as<title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title>,<title type="simple" render="italic">

            </title>, and<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Life
            </title>. During 1959 and most of 1960, St. George lived in Cuba, eventually bringing his wife and small child to Havana. By the summer of 1960 when the Cuban government began the first nationalizations of foreign property, St. George had become increasingly disillusioned with the Revolution's authoritarianism. He was also wary of Fidel Castro's apparent disposition to forsake the many promises he had made to combat Communism in Cuba that St. George had dutifully reported from the time of the guerrillas' war in the Sierra through the first year of the Revolution in 1959. When Fidel eventually announced that the Revolution was socialist and would align itself with the Soviet Union, St. George felt personally betrayed and morally outraged, as did many of the revolutionaries with whom Fidel had fought and whom St. George had known. When some of these men began to organize armed expeditions to Cuba from bases in Florida to carry out acts of counterrevolutionary economic sabotage and terror (such as the burning of cane fields), St. George reported on their actions, especially for<title type="simple" render="italic">
               Life
            </title> magazine. However, after nearly losing his own life during one such mission to Cuba as a journalist in the company of exiles, St. George eventually stopped reporting on Cuba. He parted company with the legacy of what his wife, Jean St. George, has described as his "passionate love affair" with the Cuban Revolution.</p>
         <p>Although a number of writers have alleged that St. George worked for United States intelligence agencies such as the CIA, it is unlikely that he did so. Indeed, in the 1960s and 1970s, both the CIA and Fidel Castro's government used the charge of an affiliation with the United States intelligence agencies to discredit journalists whose reports on the Revolution ran counter to their respective political ends. Additionally, in the late 1950s, most journalists who interviewed Fidel Castro and other opponents of the United States-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista were routinely interviewed by United States officials with dual roles in both consular and intelligence affairs. While it is likely that St. George submitted to such interviews, both he and his family consistently pointed out that this did not make him "an agent" of any United States intelligence organization. St. George's only known contact with the CIA came when he made his first trip to the Sierra Maestra in 1957 and was subsequently arrested by Fulgencio Batista's own security agents. The CIA, which maintained close contacts with Batista's security forces and sometimes doubled as agents for them, was responsible for freeing him. At the time, Batista and the United States government were under increasing fire from the press and public for the atrocities against civilians (including the death of at least one Cuban journalist) that the Cuban government was committing. Thus, the CIA's intervention on behalf of St. George was part of a wider effort to prevent further negative publicity. There is little doubt that St. George and his family were themselves the subject of constant surveillance from United States intelligence agencies throughout the 1960s and 1970s, an experience that St. George documented in an article for<title type="simple" render="italic">

         <p>Little is known about David C. Stone (December 30, 1932 - April 30, 2011). Characterized by Anthony Maingot as a "self-styled New York Marxist" and "a radical" with a vast network of contacts that included the Black Panthers, urban guerrillas and other antiestablishment groups, Stone's body of cinematographic works includes many independent films produced between 1963 and 1975. Almost all of the films produced before his project in Cuba received glowing reviews in the<title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Times
            </title>. Largely focused on such counter-cultural themes as the day-to-day lives of a group of urban guerrillas living in New York ("Ice" 1971) or a seven-year love triangle among beatniks in Vermont ("Hallelujah the Hills" 1963), Stone's films combined political parody and cynicism with a dark wit and doomsday social analysis. For Stone, filming in Cuba over the course of an eight-month stay during the late 1960s provided the chance to record a living social experiment in political justice that he and other leftists believed had worked. The footage he created formed the raw material for a 1970 documentary on Cuban youth titled "Compañeras y Compañeros." Given Stone's ideological orientation and commitment to supporting Cuba's struggle to defend its national sovereignty against the United States, the film depicts the Cuban Revolution as socially and politically justifiable.</p>
         <p>Made with the authorization of the Cuban government, the film stands out for being what all the rest of Stone's previous and subsequent films were not: upbeat, celebratory and positive. In this respect, the silences in "Compañeras y Compañeros" may speak more loudly and clearly than its messages. As a critic for the<title type="simple" render="italic">
               New York Times
            </title> noted at the time of the film's release in October 1970, "[Stone's real-life protagonists] believe so completely in the accomplishments of the revolution to date, and in its goals, that they waste no time trying to balance all the pros with even a few cons…. In fact, in addition to ideals, they seem to share a collective vocabulary that is so small and austere that it would seem to do a disservice to the grandeur of the revolutionary dream, the goal of which must be humanism." The Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográfica (ICAIC) sponsored Stone's trip in 1969, and Stone, his wife Barbara, and Ukranian co-producer Adolfas Mekas were accompanied by two state intelligence agents acting in the guise of chauffeurs. This does not, in itself, explain the glossy, triumphant tone of the finished film that was the fruit of their endeavors in Cuba. It is unlikely that the Stones ever knew of their chauffeurs' hidden agendas; given the filmmakers' trust in the Cuban revolutionary state, it is even more unlikely that they would have ever ventured a guess. Like many opponents of United States cold war policy who supported the Cuban Revolution unconditionally because of its defiance of United States power and championing of socialism, the Stones may have believed that the Cuban state did not rely on such methods for policing the movements of visitors and controlling the views that foreigners had of Cuba and Cubans. Ironically, it may have been precisely the Stones' own blindness to the Revolution's flaws and contradictions that enabled them to film so many scenes rich in the evidence of those flaws and contradictions. In their unedited form, these films do not depict Stone's edited version of a society unanimously echoing the official definition of revolution, nor do they mirror the Cuban state's contemporary media portrayals of a society free of indoctrination, militarism and authoritarian methods. Rather, the films speak in unexpected and complex ways that invite multiple interpretations of the revolutionary process</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is primarily comprised of photographs (positives and negatives) taken by Andrew St. George, as he tracked the progress of the Cuban Revolution from 1957 to 1960. Arranged in book number order (the numbers were assigned by the creator), there are approximately 750 contact sheets, each with multiple images, that document the 26th of July Movement from the Sierra Maestra mountains in 1957 to Havana in 1959 and Fidel Castro's first year as prime minister. There are extensive and detailed descriptions of each of the contact sheets written by Yale University Assistant Professor of History Lillian Guerra.</p>
               <p>The series also includes three reels of film, approximately seventy-five minutes of viewing time, shot in 1958 of rebel camps, outposts, and occupied towns, and as Castro made his way to Havana. They are archival film with no sound (5.111.602 KB) in DV format digitized from 16 mm original made by Andrew St. George. Characterized by St. George as "outtakes," these clips were later used in a CBS documentary made in collaboration with Robert Taber for CBS news, as well as in a documentary for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation hosted by reporter Erik Durschmied. Detailed descriptions of the three reels were written by Yale University Assistant Professor of History Lillian Guerra.</p>
               <p>Other materials in the series include written questions and answers from an interview St. George conducted with Castro in 1958, various ribbons and medallions from the 26th of July Movement, and printed ephemera.</p>
               <p>Digital reproductions of the contact sheets can be found in the Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID). A link to MADID can be found on the Manuscripts and Archives web site.</p>

                        <p>Various images of the surviving group of 18 guerrillas under the command of Fidel Castro Ruz who had landed on the southern shore of Oriente province as part of an invading force of 82 men on December 2, 1956. Calling themselves the 26th of July Movement, these men made their way into the mountains where the photographer first met them in May or June of 1957. Frame 5 shows Efigenio Ameijeiras, later first Chief of the National Revolutionary Police after 1959, sitting in a metal helmet at the center of a group of guerrillas and peasant recruits from the area. Frame 6 shows Luis Crespo (smoking with a towel on his shoulders) and to his immediate left, Victor Boronat, whom St. George describes as a recent middle-class recruit from Manzanillo, and to Crespo's immediate right Manuel Fajardo. Other rebels in Frame 5 unidentified. Frame 3 is the rebel lieutenant known as "El Negro" Pérez. Frame 4 shows Raúl Castro with peasant family resident in the area occupied by the guerrillas. Frame 2, at the bottom, shows Fidel Castro delivering a speech and inviting peasants of the area who are gathered around him to take an oath of loyalty and collaboration with the rebel cause. To Fidel's back in the front row, from right to left area: Efigenio Ameijeiras (with metal helmet), Ciro Redondo (in hat), Juan Almeida Bosque (black man with no hat), Manuel Fajardo (in hat with up-turned visor), Ernesto "Che" Guevara, Julio Díaz (curly hair with no hat), a man identified only as "Ciao," Luis Crespo (with towel around shoulders), and Ciro Frías. According to St. George, this photograph was taken in a location described as "a day's march from El Hombrito" in the Sierra Maestra mountains. See also Print 10.</p>

                        <p>Frames 1 and 2 show a group of riflemen drilling with their rifles near El Hombrito. The two men in the center of the front row are Lte. Juan Ermus (also shown with photographer in Frame 4) and Lte. "El Negro" Pérez, whom St. George describes as one of a number of rebel officer Crescencio Pérez's "many direct and lateral kinsmen who joined guerrilla force during this period and largely proved its sturdiest recruits." Note the use of 19th-century-style peasant "mambí" hats by the new rural recruits to the left of group of soldiers. Frame 3 shows one of these same peasant recruits gathering firewood. Frames 5 and 6 show Fidel Castro with two members of the urban underground organization of Oriente. The man wearing the black beret and taking notes is Marcelo Fernández and the other with his back to the camera is Victor Boronat. In the background, Celia Sánchez, the chief coordinator of the rebel underground for the city of Manzanillo, observes the scene. Frame 7 shows "El Negro" Pérez standing and lighting a cigarette or cigar with Celia Sánchez behind him on the ground and the same two men, Fernández and Boronat, in the foreground.</p>

                        <p>Campsite of Fidel Castro's guerrilla column in the area between El Hombrito and guerrilla headquarters at La Plata in the Sierra Maestra. Bottom frames 1 and 2 show the young boy soldier known as "Pedrito," Universo Sánchez and Ernesto "Che" Guevara, then serving as the rebels' medical officer. Frame 3 shows Universo Sánchez and Celia Sánchez (no relation) holding opposite ends of the Cuban flag. Behind them stands Crescencio Pérez, a local peasant leader whose influence among the local people and knowledge of the region made him an essential factor in the early period of the guerrilla struggle. In the foreground stands Ciro Redondo. Frames 5-7 show Fidel Castro relaxing at camp, reading a newspaper and enjoying a can of sweetened condensed milk, a staple food for the guerrilla that along with bacalao, guava paste and other nonperishable items was acquired and shipped to the rebels through the revolutionary underground in Oriente. Folder contains contact sheet and slide transparency of black and white photograph of Fidel reading a newspaper (Frame 7 of contact sheet) in envelope.</p>

                        <p>Rebel recruitment meeting with local peasants also described in Print 1. Top frames are taken from the opposite vantage point as the bottom. Frame 4 shows peasants raising their hands in response to Fidel's request for volunteers willing to take the oath of loyalty to the cause. In Frame 3, standing next to Fidel Castro in the center are Luis Crespo (gesturing with his right hand) and Universo Sánchez; in the left foreground is Nano Díaz (with cigar in his mouth and cartridge belt across his chest). Frame 4 also shows in the left foreground from left to right, the young guerrilla known as "Pedrito," Efigenio Ameijeiras (in metal helmet), Luis Crespo (with hat and towel around his shoulders), and Raúl Castro (with sleeves folded up, wearing hat and no beard). Frames 5 and 6 are taken from the same vantage point as Print 1. Frame 5 shows two additional figures not included in Print 1: in far-right corner wearing a metal helmet is Efigenio Ameijeiras and next to him is Raúl Castro. See also Print 1.</p>

                        <p>Top row of frames shows Fidel Castro's column on a break from marching and Fidel Castro, alongside Juan Almeida Bosque (looking down), as he greets two men: René Ramos Latour, known as "Daniel" and leader of the revolutionary underground in Santiago de Cuba (wearing hat and looking at piece of paper); and Humberto Sorí Marín (wearing sunglasses), the rebels' first Judge Advocate General and Minister of Agriculture. Latour was killed a year later in combat while Sorí Marín was eventually executed for counterrevolutionary activities against the leadership of Fidel Castro in Havana in 1961. The next frame in the same row shows Fidel Castro pointing at a young man with an inside-out cap on his head who is a captured government soldier. Behind him is a rebel recruit wearing a chauffeur's cap. The final frame in this row shows Fidel talking to two local peasants who happened upon the rebels' resting point, and shows Fidel unhitching his rucksack. Juan Almeida Bosque stands on Fidel's right. The second row of frames shows Fidel Castro talking to a peasant porter and then to another peasant serving as a local guide. Final frames in this row show Fidel with Celia Sánchez and Fidel talking with René Ramos Latour (hatless) and Juan Almeida Bosque, whose back is to the camera. The third row of frames shows Celia Sánchez bandaging Fidel Castro's finger, Fidel Castro pointing, a sleeping soldier and Luis Crespo serving as guard in an improvised look-out post. The fourth set of frames shows Crespo again, Fidel Castro aiming a rifle and rear guardsmen advancing cautiously along the footpath. The fifth row of frames features Guillermo García in the middle frame asleep on the ground with his helmet half-off, as well as a group of local male and female peasants making their way down the footpath. The sixth row of frames shows Fidel and unidentified rebels speaking to a peasant and Lt. Humberto Díaz Rodríguez, then serving as Fidel's personal aide and bodyguard, stopping a suspicious peasant whom Juan Almeida Bosque proceeds to frisk in the first image of frames in the seventh, succeeding row. Also in the seventh row of images is a frontal view of the suspicious peasant with Díaz Rodríguez as well as a questioning session led by Efigenio Ameijeiras as the chauffeur-capped recruit looks on. The final frame of this row shows Juan Almeida Bosque pointing a rifle. The eighth and last row of frames in this sheet shows two images of an unidentified guerrilla wearing a beret (whom St. George incorrectly identifies as Manuel Fajardo), a fifteen-year-old guerrilla named Joel Yglesias, and Julio Díaz. Fidel appears in the last frame (4) of the set. See also Print 23.</p>

                        <p>Taken in September of 1957, these images document a strategy of guerrilla warfare on which the rebels had, until that point, not generally relied. According to St. George, the strategy was to interdict traffic and burn the sugarcane fields in the immediate proximity of the highway. These sugarcane fields were located near Bayamo and the vehicles seized temporarily by the rebels include a bus, a taxicab and a truck. On this occasion, as St. George writes, the rebels "rode around, in and on [the vehicles] in great high spirits. Note this was a full year before the interdiction of all highway traffic within rebel reach became a matter of policy for Fidel; in consequence, none of the vehicles or civilians shown here suffered from their encounter with the barbudos."

                        <p>This sheet documents a principal rebel safe house in the city of Manzanillo that served as a key point in the supply and courier line for the rebels in the Sierra Maestra mountains. The top row of frames show the bay of Manzanillo as well as the photographer shooting a picture of himself in the mirror as he waited to be picked up by the guerrillas chief courier. The second row of frames apparently shows this man to be Felipe Guerra Matos. The house and surrounding rice farm were owned by Ricardo Lorie, a wealthy landowner from Manzanillo, for whom Felipe Guerra Matos worked at the time. Also shown is the photographer in Frame 4 and Celia Sánchez. The remaining frames on the sheet show what St. George described as "the various 'reception committees' encountered by our rapidly marching group as it penetrated into the Sierra Maestra foothills. There is a group of rebel runners in peasant clothes, accompanied by a teniente [lieutenant]; three peasant boys who also served as lookouts and messengers; the first rebel perimeter patrol; the first rebel sentries among the rocks dominating the footpaths approaching guerrilla territory."

                        <p>Court-martial of several local peasants, accused of common crimes such as homicide, rape and robbery and in other cases, of being a double agent charged with treason against the Revolution by Fidel Castro and his fellow guerrillas. According to St. George, the trial lasted several days and involved the testimony of over 30 peasants. It took place in an area known as El Naranjo. In these images, Fidel is seen with the five-member revolutionary tribunal that he appointed and in which he occupies the central chair. Members of the tribunal are best identified in row two, frames 13, 14, and 15 (left to right): Humberto Sorí Marín (former president of the Inter-American Bar Association), Fidel Castro and Camilo Cienfuegos (front row); René Ramos Latour ("Daniel") and Celia Sánchez (second row). The accused appears with his back to the camera and his hands tied behind his back in the last frame of the second row and the first two frames of the third row. In the fourth row of frames, Raúl Castro is seen writing in his campaign diary as he sits perched in a tree overlooking the court-martial scene below. The seventh row of frames shows Universo Sánchez, now bearded, in the center of a group of rebels in a metal helmet; he is also seen sitting in the first row, first frame.

                        <p>Top-most set of two frames followed by five frames in another row depict Fidel Castro chatting with local peasants. Frame 21 shows Fidel Castro accompanied by Celia Sánchez and Camilo Cienfuegos in the foreground, in profile; Juan Almeida Bosque in the background, immediately behind Fidel. Frames 22 and 23 show Luis Crespo in hat with ear-flaps, smoking a cigarette. St. George identifies Lao Sardiñas in these images as well, although it is not clear whether he is the man in the metal helmet with his hand to his face or the bearded and hatted man wearing suspenders behind Fidel. Frame that is set apart shows two soldiers whom St. George identifies as "both Pardo brothers" holding fragments of a bomb dropped from a government plane. St. George adds that "Long talks with guajiros [local peasants], wherever they were encountered, were essential facet of Castro's strategy." See also Print 19.</p>

According to St. George, it was "for specific tactical reasons, probably the single most important detached unit." All rebel soldiers who comprise the unit are unidentified. Fifth and sixth rows of frames show local peasants (esp. frames 28, 34, 35) who served as witnesses in the court-martial/trial of Carlos Ramírez, a man charged and convicted of rape, murder and robbery during St. George's stay with the rebels. In frames 29, 30, he is pictured to the left of the frame, next to another man whose hands are tied behind his back. In frame 31, Ramírez is seen by himself. Final row of frames shows Efigenio Ameijeiras (in metal helmet) with two members of the rear guard platoon on patrol. See also Prints 15, 19, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37 and 41.</p>

                        <p>After holding a three-day court-martial, Fidel Castro's column of guerrillas prepares to carry out a series of executions of local peasants, some of whom are accused of common crimes like rape and murder, and others of whom are accused of treason against the Revolution; all those tried, according to St. George, were executed by firing squad during his stay. Top frames in the first row show Raúl Castro, chief coordinator according to St. George of the executions, apparently giving instructions to the men followed by two frames in which a Catholic priest St. George identified as "Father Yares" (possibly his nom de guerre) but whose real name was Padre Guillermo Sardiñas, an ordained Catholic priest, gives the prisoners last rites and Raúl Castro ties a blindfold around the second prisoner's eyes. The fourth image in the top row of frames shows the guerrillas observing the execution. One man, possibly Jorge Enrique Mendoza of Radio Rebelde, the guerrillas' clandestine radio station, can be seen to the left of the frame (with goatee), holding a camera in his hands. Camilo Cienfuegos stands to his left, on the other side of a tree trunk. The second row of frames shows a smiling Juan Almeida Bosque and several close-up shots of a rebel whom comrades nicknamed "Cantínflas" for his resemblance to the Mexican comedic film actor of the 1930s and 1940s. The third row of frames shows Padre Sardiñas with a third prisoner and then the prisoner immediately after his execution. The fourth row of frames shows Fidel Castro talking to the guerrillas, facing Raúl Castro. The fifth row of frames shows a duplicate of a photograph taken earlier in which two members of the Pardo gang exhibit the shell of a bomb dropped by government aircraft, also seen in Print 17. The bottom frames show the guerrillas following the execution of the man seen in row three of the frames on this sheet. See also Prints 15, 19, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37 and 41.</p>

                        <p>Various images of unidentified guerrillas at look-out posts, aiming their rifles. The third row of frames shows Felipe Guerra Matos sitting in a hammock and eating from a bowl inside a large open-walled hut. Successive frames in the same row show an unidentified guerrilla who appears to be peeling the skin from a small native snake with a knife in his right hand and a spoon in his left. Other frames show guerrillas guarding the campsite.</p>

                        <p>Fidel Castro's guerrilla camp in the forests of the Sierra Maestra, near El Naranjo. Top frames show unidentified members of the civilian underground who have just arrived in the mountains. Third through sixth row of frames show unidentified man in a tattered light-colored shirt, possibly a worker captured for questioning from a nearby plantation or military outpost in conversation with Fidel Castro. Although his hands are behind his back in the final frames, they are not tied. Efigenio Ameijeiras (guerrilla in helmet) can be seen in final set of frames. See also Print 11.</p>

                        <p>In the first frame, Fidel Castro, Juan Almeida Bosque and other unidentified guerrillas stand over the burial sites of a recently deceased man. The placing of two pairs of men's shoes in the right-hand corner of disturbed earth would appear to show at least two graves, although only one lies within range of the camera's frame. The young guerrilla in the foreground appears distressed and Almeida Bosque and Castro's eyes follow him as he retreats from the graves. It is likely that these were the graves of the prisoners executed as a result of multiple courts-martial held in El Naranjo. The other two frames show Fidel Castro and Juan Almeida Bosque.

Second row of photographs shows a duplicate shot of St. George photographing himself in the mirror at a safe house in Manzanillo (see Print 13). Other images in the second row show guerrillas relaxing with guns in front of a peasant hut and a group of guerrillas sifting beans for small stones and other debris before cooking. The last row of frames begins with a picture of either a small boy or old man wearing baggy pants and standing on top of an abandoned refrigerator in the middle of what had been a peasant dwelling that was burned or bombed to the ground; surrounding the boy on the refrigerator, one can see the original wall posts marking the limits of the house. Final two frames show unidentified rebels marching up from a river bed. See also Prints 27, 40, 45; for St. George photographing himself in safe house, see Print 13.</p>

                        <p>Top row, far-right-corner frame, shows Oniria Gutiérrez, a 16-year-old female guerrilla, posing with a telescopic rifle belonging to Fidel Castro. According to St. George, this same rifle was "loaned" to other guerrillas during his stay in 1957 so as to give the impression that the rebels owned more than one and were well-armed. In this Print, the same rifle also appears in the hands of unknown black guerrilla soldier in the last frame of the last row, alongside a second image of Oniria Gutiérrez as she examines an unloaded hand pistol. Oniria is seen leaning out of the window and sitting beside a house that served as an army kitchen, as seen in Print 34. Beginning with frame 112 in the top row and in successive frames (marked 106, 107, 113, 115, 116) appears Crescencio Pérez, the older man with white and grey beard, who can be seen most clearly standing at the center of a group of rebels in frame 112 and drinking coffee in subsequent frame. Crescencio Pérez was the first peasant recruit to the guerrillas and the first local landowner to offer the rebels sanctuary and aid when they arrived in the Sierra Maestra in December of 1956. In 1959, Fidel Castro awarded him the rank of Commander (Comandante). In frames 115 and 116, Pérez talks to Fidel Castro as they sit along the shore of a riverbed. In frame 118, Fidel Castro speaks to a peasant scout flanked by Juan Almeida Bosque and an unidentified guerrilla (wearing a metal helmet). See also Prints 34, 47 and 48.</p>

                        <p>Top frames show Fidel Castro consulting with members of his forces and a team of three guerrillas talking as they apparently keep watch. The third row of frames shows a large peasant family of several generations in which two of the adult men, probably members of local underground rural network of supporters and saboteurs, point rifles while posing with their relatives. The fourth row of frames depicts a truck requisitioned by the guerrillas and a group of guerrillas marching across a riverbed. The fifth row of frames shows Fidel Castro and others consulting a peasant man mounted on a white horse (also pictured in frame 23A in fourth row) and peasants as they prepare to contribute their labor to the digging of a trench, among other tasks. The sixth and seventh rows of frames depict a large group of peasants digging alongside a gravel road with pick axes and other implements, apparently in order to lay a live wire for the timed detonation of explosives along the road (the wire is clearly visible in Frames 27 and 28). In these pictures, as well as the bottom-most row of frames, the guerrillas are seen standing guard nearby while the peasants do the work. See also Print 56.</p>

                        <p>These frames document the guerrillas' capture of a bus, probably belonging to a local plantation or military post. Most of the frames show the guerrillas riding in the bus (rows 4-7). Top frames suggest that the bus and a truck were acquired after a mine or other explosive the guerrillas planted alongside the road exploded, damaging the truck and prompting any passengers inside to abandon the vehicle. The bus may have come along afterward, affecting the same result: unable to proceed, driver and passengers fled. Frames 27 and 28 of the third row appear to document the guerrillas' arrival and discovery of the two abandoned vehicles in the middle of the road. These events may have to do with the planting of explosives connected to a booby trap cable alongside the road depicted in Print 54. One of the passengers, an unidentified foreign journalist, possibly working for CBS, appears shirtless in Frame 39, riding with the guerrillas in the bus. The same man also appears interviewing Fidel and carrying a small movie camera in the bottom left-hand frame of Print 58. See also Prints 54 and 58.</p>

Frames 17-19 show a guerrilla wearing a "mambí-style" hat, cleaning his rifle. Frames 21-27 depict an unidentified, overweight journalist, probably foreign, interviewing peasant recruits to the guerrilla cause. Frame 23 shows Manzanillo's chief courier, Felipe Guerra Matos, with a moustache and broken leg in cast. This picture and subsequent images were probably shot at a rebel field hospital. In frames 24-37, Haydee Santamaría and Celia Sánchez sit disposing of dirty, used cotton bandages by burning them. Folder contains two duplicate contact sheets; see also Prints 51, 53, 61 and 66.</p>

                        <p>Various images of unidentified guerrillas engaged in different tasks. Top frames show a man holding telescopic rifle as he does guard duty at the door of a peasant hut; a guerrilla wearing a cowboy hat and loading a rifle; a guerrilla jubilantly carrying a large native turkey. Second row shows unidentified older man wearing fatigues and engaged in conversation. The third row shows a black guerrilla unloading a bomb from the back of a horse and then carrying the unexploded bomb on his shoulder, probably recovered from Batista's air raids. The final row shows a guerrilla unit on the march through farmlands.</p>

                        <p>Top frames in row one show Fidel Castro from a look-out point in the Sierra Maestra. The last frame in this row shows a coffee farm (with drying beds to the left, behind farm house) in which both rebels and peasants can be seen. The rebels imposed a tax on all coffee produced in the region that they controlled; their presence there may indicate collection of that tax or general cooperation by the farm's owner and workers. The second and third rows of frames show Fidel Castro getting a tooth pulled through the use of a sewing machine; by attaching one end of the cord of the gripping device to the machine's wheel and the other to the unhealthy tooth, the tooth could be extracted more easily. Beginning with frame 12, Celia Sánchez is depicted assisting in the tooth extraction and later sitting near Fidel while both appear to be reading letters.</p>

                        <p>This depicts the sort of guerrilla unit that came into existence in 1958, during the second year of civil war, when the rebels gradually expanded their zone of operations: a perimeter unit near Santiago, marking the extent of the Castro forces advance toward the provincial capital. This unit is under Capt. Humberto Diaz Rodriguez, a guerrilla officer from Habana (frames 28-29; also 10-16, note that while Capt. Rodriguez is here shown holding phone, the phone is not really connected). Frames 8 and 9: rebel sentry, whose beard indicates some combat service, but whose shiny shoes, new hat and clean pants indicate the requisitioning of new supplies in the area. In these areas surrounding the major cities of Oriente Province where the rebels managed to set up and defend such outposts, they had extensive contacts with the - almost invariably sympathetic - civilian population. (Frames 2-7) As a result of this commerce with the better-provisioned population of these open plains - now definitely out of the mountain jungles of the Sierra Maestra range - the rebels acquire and roast a small pig: Frames 17-19, also 21-26; also 30-36. Note Frame 27, with Frames 28-29 noted above, shows Capt. Humberto Diaz Rodriguez taking stock of sizable rice stores requisitioned locally.</p>

                        <p>The first frames here (6-12) depict, much as Print 2 does, an advanced perimeter rebel post near Santiago, this one commanded by Cdte. Rene de los Santos (Frame 7, center, long raincoat) operating a radio transmission facility (RR12, that is Radio Rebelde Doce) and a relay point for couriers, supply runners, forward observation agents (i.e. spies). Frame 9 depicts such a function: a confidential personality en route to rebel headquarters (an operative or perhaps a minor local community leader committed to cooperation with the guerrillas) is passed through in a jeep blanketed with a large plastic shower curtain to keep the passenger invisible. Even the frames showing the stuck truck are illustrative: the favorite sport of rebel advance units was the acquisition and operation of motor transport, an enterprise they often attacked with more enthusiasm than expertise. Other frames show the photographer on the shore near the RR12 shortwave shack.</p>

                        <p>A series of short takes showing rebel positions on perimeter of Sierra stronghold: this one at Maffo, under Capt. Henrique Boronat* (on the bottom rows of frames, Capt. Boronat is always the young officer in broadbrimmed hat on extreme right, with armband and shoulder patch: he is also shown on frames 27-31 supervising coffee processing in a local cafetal.) Frames 25-26 show another significant perimeter activity: this is the "defection team" of Cdte. Faul Chibas (right, beard, hat, eyeglasses) and Cdte. Jose Quevedo (center). Cdte. Quevedo was a high-ranking Batista Army officer captured by the rebel forces during the big government push in June 1958; Quevedo (who was trapped together with most of his troop, the 17th Bataillon) subsequently joined the guerrilla forces and went on special assignment with Raul Chibas. Their mission was to contact military commanders commanding government troops at army outposts facing the rebel perimeter, and attempt to talk them into defecting to the Castro forces. Note man on left in these two frames (civilian with sombrero, pistol) is typical local go-between utilized in these clandestine feelers towards wavering government officers. Frames 32-36 show funeral of local townsman caught in crossfire between rebel and government patrols. Note on last frame (36) bearded Negro officer in center is "Pombo" who accompanied Che to Bolivia in 1967 and became one of half-dozen guerrilla leaders in that expedition to escape alive and somehow return to Cuba via Chile. *Not to be confused with Victor Boronat shown in Book 1.</p>

Most of the frames show Capt. Ramirez with his favorite devices: pipebombs, home-crafted road mines, etc. Top three left frames show guerrilla hammocks slung in an abandoned back-country cockpit.

                        <p>This is the bomb shop at Cdte. Luis "El Guajiro" Crespo's station (shown on Print 14). Frames in bottom row show welder cutting up bomb shells to make casings for small rebel bombs. The bomb shells are, of course, the remnants of aerial bombs dropped on the rebels by the Batista Government's Air Force: for some reason - perhaps technical, perhaps negligence or sabotage, perhaps owing to the peculiar topography of the jungle - an extraordinary number of such bombs failed to explode on landing. Frames 21-30 show Crespo seated outside bomb shop (with his crippled ward) making rebel hand grenades from sheet iron and TNT obtained from government's dud bombs. These hand grenades - thousands were fabricated at the guerrillas' four main bomb shops during the civil war - had to be lit to be detonated: the granadero lit a cigar going into combat and touched the glowing end of it to the fuse of one of these handmade grenades whenever he wanted to toss one at the enemy. Frames 10-20 show Crespo and the master bomb maker El Gallego Maestro manufacturing bombs.</p>

                        <p>Faces and groups photographed at Fidel Castro's La Plata headquarters in the early fall of 1958. Top four frames on right (34-37): Dr. Faustino Perez, a commandante then newly retired from his assignment of coordinator of urban underground activities in Habana - in the aftermath of the disastrous failure of the April 9 general strike attempt organized under the direction of Dr. Perez - and attached to La Plata headquarters staff. Frames 5-16 show a typical bit of business at Fidel's own headquarters hut at La Plata: a small troop of guerrilla soldiers arrives to be dispatched personally by Fidel. For the most part they are fairly recent recruits, mixed with a few bearded veterans (such was the customary composition of new units) and they're on their way to join a line unit - Paco Cabrera's peloton. On frames 5-9 the view of these men is as Fidel sees them from his headquarters hut; on frames 10-12 Fidel is seen joining them and briefly addressing them; on frames 13-14 Fidel ducks back into his office, and the men, after waiting some moments, leave up the hill, along the precipitous path forming the approach to Fidel's house (frames 15-16). Rest of frames show Fidel briefing an officer in front of his headquarters hut.</p>

Note frames 8-13 show characteristic bit of daily business: Fidel brought a dispatch (by unidentified local messenger) and reads it with typical concentration. Frames 14-16: Fidel is shown here in another typical command pursuit - receiving the visit of two local politicians who have begun to discern need to establish contact with the leader of the guerrilla forces spreading through the province. Man on left (sombrero) is, in fact, a congressman from one of the nearby districts; fat man on right is one of his honchos. Congressman is identified in our notes only as (first name unknown) Nelson.</p>

                        <p>Fidel Castro inside rebel communications center, under command of very efficient officer, Cdte. Waldo Fernandez (frames 9-12, et seq.). This radio tower had several call signs - RR1, i.e. "Radio Rebelde Uno," also RR7; by the fall of 1958 (date of this photo), it had become the guerrilla forces' principal communications and propaganda lifeline. Frames 19-24 show the field hospital adjoining La Plata headquarters, then under command of Dr. Rene Vallejo and Dr. Bernade Ordaz, the Hospital Mario Muniz. Note that according to strict rebel sanitary policy, local hill people and rebel troopers wait for treatment in this queue without discrimination. Rebels always extended medical services to civilians under their control: this became important source of local support. Other frames show Fidel at La Plata.</p>

                        <p>This sheet shows only sound-on-film, hour-long TV interview granted by Fidel Castro in Sierra Maestra. The cameraman, Erik Durschmied of Montreal, managed, together with this photographer, to smuggle a full Auricon sound rig into rebel headquarters at La Plata: it was set up on a hilltop overlooking Fidel's own headquarters complex. Film was lost for several months in process of being smuggled out of the Sierra, but was recovered in time to be shown on the CBC's popular Pierre Berthot interview show shortly after rebel victory in January 1959. CBC cameraman Erik Durschmied (hat, sunglasses) is shown on frames 4-23 with Fidel.</p>

                        <p>This sheet was photographed along the approach route to Fidel Castro's headquarters near La Plata. Lt. Vilo Acuna testing his homemade rebel rifle grenade launcher (frames 3-10; See also Print 18.). Frames 12-18: Rebel requisitioned road grader with its proud guerrilla crew. Among approach routes to central guerrilla areas - the approach routes through foothills - growing rebel troop units were beginning to maintain roads, transfer points, supply dumps for gasoline and lubricants, and other semi-permanent installations designed to insure a predictable flow of military traffic through back roads of rebel zone. Frames 25-26 show Capt. Mario Hidalgo with his family. On right, youth in uniform is Mario's son, Hanibal Hidalgo, then photographer's travel aide. Note dog-tag hanging from Hanibal's neck: it was captured from government soldiers and laboriously re-engraved by hand, giving Hanibal much-wanted military appearance. Frames 32-37: Outside Fidel's headquarters hut at La Plata, the headquarters' dental officer, Dr. Enrique Borges, has his foot-operated drill and consulta.</p>

These men are bringing electrical gear used to repair radio gear and fuse homemade bombs. Frames 5-8: one of the items manufactured from electrical supplies brought in by runners is this little cheeseglass-detonator known as "Che's jam jar," either because Che invented it or because it was developed at bomb shop in Che's column. It is an impact-squeeze detonator that will activate a concealed road mine or a large hand-hurled bomb.</p>

Ramirez menaces him with pistol, firing past his ear. But suspect was not otherwise harmed and released later same day. The threat of summary execution was rebel's only means of coercing information from suspects.</p>

                        <p>These photos, shot in early fall of 1958, document decisive rebel military breakthrough in its initial stage: all around the Sierra Maestra range government forces are withdrawing, evacuating small, hard-to-defend outposts and minor towns. This sheet shows the taking of a small town, Las Minas de Bueycito, by forces from Cdte. Fidel Castro's own Columna Nr. Uno: it was a momentous event, for it was the first real town occupied (if only for twenty-four hours) by this column. Cdte. Humberto Sorí Marin, rebel's Judge Advocate General and the commander who led this particular advance, is shown on horseback on Frame 24. Capt. Mario Vasquez, another senior troop leader, is shown on frame 30. Woman - the local pharmacist - detained for questioning on charges that she was a government informer (not an implausible idea, for this town had just been evacuated after long occupation by a government battaillon) shown in frames 5-9.</p>

                        <p>This sheet shows rebel entry into Las Minas de Bueycito, first town to be seized and held for twenty-four hours by troops of Cdte. Castro's own Columna Nro. Uno (see also Print 46.) Fidel Castro is shown on frames 19-20: this was a historical occasion, for he had entered Las Minas at nightfall on horseback, and is shown here in local general store back room (a store belonging to the pro-rebel Abich family repeatedly mentioned by Che Guevera) talking to town leaders. However, since everyone was terrified of appearing in any sort of published photographic account of this event - that is, a published account that would document collaboration or sympathy with the rebels after the army troops had returned in strength a few days later, an event anticipated by all - picture taking was limited that night. It was restricted to some shots of Paco Cabrera, one of Columna Uno's senior troop leaders, drinking beer (frame 6); other men from the column having a bang-up dinner; a shot of Fidel's faithful cook (frame 21); and shots of rebels withdrawing early next morning (frames 21-28).</p>

With government forces showing unmistakable signs of weakness, rebel recruiting rose rapidly. These recruits had already undergone some staging and selection at a rebel induction station; they are here on their way for combat training at one of the several such facilities acquired by guerrilla forces by early fall of 1958.

                        <p>These prints document the arrival of large number of reporters (Prints 1-2) to the Second Front "Frank País," opened in the spring of 1958 by Raúl Castro and his large number of rebel troops in the area near Banes, Oriente, where the largest number of United States-owned properties were concentrated. The reporters were visiting on the occasion of the first direct negotiations between representatives of the United States government's consular office in Santiago de Cuba and members of the 26th of July Movement. Their meeting, as seen in Prints 3-5, was arranged in response to the seizure of forty-eight hostages, including twenty-eight marines, by Raúl Castro's forces in protest of the United States' continued supplying of Batista's air force with military weaponry, including napalm and other materials. Batista's pilots had flown over one hundred missions in the area, bombing exclusively civilian rather than guerrilla targets as part of a counterinsurgency campaign he called "Total War." Print no. 4 shows the reporters, including CBS newsman Robert Taber (frame 15, hatless man on the left), taking off from the United States naval base at Guantánamo and flying over the area. Print No. 5 shows Vilma Espín (frames 18-20) apparently showing off her shooting skills with an automatic weapon, as well as Raúl Castro (in cowboy hat) with reporters and U.S. consular agents (frames 4-12).

                        <p>This print shows United States hostages held by Raúl Castro's forces in the liberated zone created by his recently opened Second Front "Frank País," preparing to be released. The hostages were taken as part of a defensive strategy developed in June 1958 when evidence emerged that the United States was continuing to ship military supplies (such as napalm) to Batista's air force through Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, despite the fact that the United States had declared an official embargo on further arms shipments in March of that year. In May, Batista's air force flew over one hundred flights that bombed and attacked the civilian population in the mountains that offered aid to the rebels. The hostage (shown shaving in frames 5-7) appears to be one of the United States company employees taken hostage, rather than a marine. The twenty-eight marines captured were being held elsewhere.

Having taken the reins of power in the city of Santiago de Cuba earlier that day, Fidel declared Santiago the temporary capital of the country and spoke for over three hours, well past midnight, to a huge crowd gathered in the city's central plaza. Among the dignitaries who lent support on that day was the Archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, Enrique Pérez Serante (frames 9-10). To the right of Fidel Castro in frames 33-36 (wearing glasses, bearded) is the longtime rebel underground leader for Manzanillo, Felipe Guerra Matos. See also Prints 20, 22, 31, 32, 39 and 41.</p>

                        <p>This print shows the destruction of civilian dwellings by Batista's air force bombing campaign in the weeks leading up to the final collapse and partial surrender of the dictator's high command. Frames 11-12 show a Catholic priest, probably a Franciscan, speaking with members of the rebel forces in an area that appears to be an abandoned bunker. In many cases, Batista's troops gave themselves up to the conquering rebels through Catholic clerics who served as intermediaries. See also Print 12.</p>

                        <p>Contains two prints. The first print shows damages caused to civilian housing by Batista's air force bombing raids during the last weeks of 1958 before the collapse of the regime. The second print shows rebels riding on a tank followed by the jeep in which the photographer was riding. It is likely that these images were taken in the first or second day following the rebel victory when St. George and two other journalists, Jules Dubois of the Chicago Tribune and Jay Mallin of Time-Life, accompanied Fidel Castro's caravan from Oriente to Havana.</p>

                        <p>This is the first print that traces Fidel's victory caravan as it made its way to Havana. At various points, Fidel made up for time lost on the way to greet cheering and grateful citizens by taking a British helicopter for portions of the route that his forces had captured from the defeated Batista military days earlier. Here Fidel rendezvouses with members of his team that have advanced by car. Frames 5-12 show some of the guerrillas having breakfast in a workers' cafeteria. See also Prints 14-17 and 47.</p>

                        <p>Taken in the very first days following the collapse of the dictatorship and the rebels' seizure of power, this print shows Fidel being crowded by guerrillas and well-wishers as he proceeds in his victory caravan to Havana. Frames 13-27 show Fidel in profile as he converses with Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo, a key figure in the military front of El Escambray mountains in the central province of Santa Clara. Gutiérrez Menoyo's early involvement in the urban struggle against Batista was marked by the death of his brother at the hands of Batista's police. Gutiérrez Menoyo later turned against Fidel when the Revolution became Marxist and conspired in a new armed movement against the government until he was captured and imprisoned, ultimately serving twenty years.</p>

Standing with Fidel in frames 8-22 are a group of former batistiano pilots responsible for the bombing campaign that killed and terrorized so many civilians from May to December 1958. On the occasion of the meeting, Fidel famously assured the men that they would not be subject to trial and execution for their crimes, although he reversed that position several weeks later and all the pilots were executed. Frames 24-25 show two exhausted guerrillas asleep in the back of an American-made car with the driver (frame 26) looking on. See also Print 21.</p>

Prints 5-7 show a small boy-turned-guerrilla who guards recently acquired munitions from the cuartel with a rifle across his lap. The guerrillas incorporated a number of children in the last months before the triumph, especially as Batista's bombing raids left many peasant families homeless and children orphaned.

                        <p>Top frames show Fidel meeting with and speaking to a reporter in the first days after the rebel victory at the airport in Camagüey where he awaited the arrival of Manuel Urrutia, the man whom Fidel Castro had designated Provisional President of Cuba as early as 1957. Appearing in frames 8-14 and 19, Urrutia can be seen in the center, wearing glasses and a suit and tie. In the background is the plane named Guaímaro, formerly used by Batista as the presidential plane. Urrutia had been sworn in as President sometime earlier in the city of Santiago where Fidel formally took the reins of power on January 1st. Also present to receive him is Melba Hernández (frames 23-26), one of the two heroines of Fidel's disastrous 1953 assault on the Moncada military barracks on the 26th of July. The event founded the guerrilla movement. See also Prints 19, 49 and 50.</p>

                        <p>These images document the arrival of Manuel Urrutia Lleó, the man whom Fidel Castro had designated Provisional President of Cuba as early as 1957, at the Camagüey airport. Urrutia apparently arrived by the plane named Guaímaro, formerly used by Batista as the presidential plane. Urrutia would be sworn in as President later that day. See also Prints 18, 49 and 50.</p>

Standing with him in frames 36 and 37 is Armando Hart (to the right, wearing dark shirt). Prints 4-7 appear to show rebels dividing up some roasted meat amongst themselves from the back of a truck. Prints 8-12 show a group of rebels, reporters and former pilots of the air force gathered at the entrance of the building where Fidel will deliver his radio address. See also Print 15.</p>

The second row of frames show townspeople gathered on the street "Luis Varona" in the central part of the city; political posters advertising the candidates for Fulgencio Batista's recent fraudulent electoral "show" are still visible on the walls of buildings in the background. These images were taken in the first days of January 1959 as St. George accompanied Fidel Castro's motorcade on its way to Havana.</p>

                        <p>Fidel Castro in a home along the route followed by his victorious motorcade from Oriente to Havana in the first week after the rebel victory in January 1959. Surrounded by rebels, as well as civilian supporters who appear to reside at the home, Fidel is seen granting a television interview to a Cuban reporter (frames 9-17) and signing an autograph for a young adolescent Cuban girl wearing glasses (frames 3-7). Exact location of the event is unknown although it is likely that the home was located along the national highway, perhaps in Camagüey. See also Print 26.</p>

                        <p>This print shows rebel officers and soldiers lounging in the driveway and conversing with foreign reporters outside the house where Fidel Castro is granting an interview to a Cuban television reporter on route to Havana in the first days after the fall of the Batista regime in January 1959. The location of the house is probably along the national highway in Camagüey. In Frames 10-19, Humberto Sorí Marín is second from the left in the group of rebels, most of whom probably belong to Fidel's personal bodyguard unit, or esolta. Frames 20-23 show an unidentified American man, possibly a reporter, speaking to the rebels and leaning against the back of the car Fidel used in the motorcade to Havana. The final two frames (24 and 25) appear to show Raúl Chibás (on the left, wearing glasses and full beard) sitting next to an unidentified member of Fidel Castro's escolta, later joined by an unidentified older man wearing two-tone leather shoes.

                        <p>This print shows members of Fidel's personal bodyguard unit guarding the gate of a house at which he is staying along the national highway of Camagüey as his motorcade made its way from Oriente to Havana in the first days of January 1959. Frames 18-36 show Fidel speaking to other rebels and reporters along the tarmac of the Ignacio Agramonte Airport in the city of Camagüey. Shown standing near Fidel to his immediate left in frames 20, 22 and 23 is Armando Hart, a member of the revolutionary underground, whose father, a judge, famously objected to the prosecution of rebels on constitutional grounds and was dismissed from the bench by the Cuban Supreme Court in the summer of 1958. Armando's brother, also an urban revolutionary activist, was killed by a bomb some weeks before this incident. Armando himself later became the first Minister of Education, a post he held until he was promoted to Minister of Culture in 1976. See also Print 38.</p>

                        <p>Images of Fidel Castro's motorcade as it made its way along the national highway in the victorious march to Havana. These images were taken as Fidel stopped his car (shown in frames 20, 29-34) to greet a priest, a nun and an opulently dressed lay woman (shown in frames 35-36). These latter frames were famously reproduced in the first of the three million "liberty" editions of the Cuban magazine Bohemia, published over a three-week period beginning the second week of January 1959.

                        <p>Taken on January 1, 1959, and stamped January 7, 1959, on the reverse side, these prints document the first victory speech given by Fidel Castro upon the fall and flight from Cuba of the dictator Fulgencio Batista. Having taken the reins of power in the city of Santiago de Cuba earlier that day, Fidel declared Santiago the temporary capital of the country and spoke for over three hours, well past midnight, to a huge crowd gathered in the city's central plaza.

                        <p>Scenes from the highly symbolic rebel takeover in January 1959 of the Cuartel Moncada, the military barracks in Santiago de Cuba which was the original target of the failed assault by Fidel Castro's "Movimiento Centenario" on July 26, 1953. The event itself and the resulting massacre of the Centenary forces by Batista's troops led to the remaining rebels' imprisonment and exile and was the foundation of the future guerrilla movement led by Fidel Castro known as the "26th of July." Frames 26-32 show a surprising degree of fraternization between rebel officers and surrendering members of Batista's military.</p>

                        <p>A number of random images dating from the first days of January showing nocturnal scenes of townspeople and reporters gathered in an unidentified location, possibly a roadside watering hole where they are seen eating and talking. The top row (frames 36-37) shows a Batista-era police officer standing behind a desk while talking to a long-haired man sitting in front of him, probably a rebel soldier. It is likely that these images were taken along the route of Fidel Castro's triumphant motorcade as it made its way to Havana.</p>

                        <p>This print features various unusual scenes of jubilant townspeople as they greet Fidel Castro in the central streets of an unidentified provincial city during the first days of January 1959, right after the fall of Batista. Frames 3-14 appear to show an entirely different location than top rows of frames: these frames (3-14) in the bottom rows include images of the preparation of a speaker's dais before a municipal government building, as well as a rebel soldier examining a leaflet of pro-dictator propaganda (frame 5); the leaflet he is holding has a 26th of July guerrilla wearing blackface and squeezing the far-eastern end of the island with one hand while the red flag of Communism flies in the background. Frames 15-31 appear to show crowds of revelers on the outskirts of Havana proper as Fidel Castro arrives by tank and wades through the people.</p>

The top two rows of frames, shot from inside a car, show the delighted and startled faces of civilians as they see and touch for the first time the rebel soldiers (who had long been a source of anxiety and fear as well as empowerment and inspiration). The remaining rows of images show townspeople gathering and pressing in on the rebel vehicles as well as the gate of the police station in the town.</p>

Frames 5-6 appear to show Roberto Agramonte (bald and corpulent man to the left), the first Minister of Foreign Relations under the first revolutionary government of President Manuel Urrutia and Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Frame 14 shows a guerrilla soldier taking a break and drinking a bottle of Coca-Cola. Frames 15 and 17-20 depict Armando Hart, a key figure in the rebel underground, standing next to his fiancée, Haydée Santamaría, the legendary heroine of Fidel Castro's 1953 assault on the Moncada barracks.

Frames 24 and 25 show both a rebel soldier and a batistiano soldier guarding the gate of the city's police station while frames 26-35 show police and soldiers surrendering to rebels by piling their weapons in the middle of the station's courtyard, to the backs of the rebel and batistiano guards. Frames 17-23 show townspeople gathering outside the mammoth military headquarters in the center of the city and final rows of images depict the interior of the same building where officers are handing over authority to the rebels.

                        <p>Probably taken in the late night, early morning hours of January 1, 1959, during or after Fidel Castro's famous first address to the people of Santiago, these images show at least one military soldier (see man in helmet with back to camera, frame 16), rebel soldiers and local people on the streets and in a tavern. The top three rows of frames show members of Fidel Castro's esolta (see the gray and long-haired rebel in the far right-hand corner of these frames with rifle in hand), as well as local citizens sitting on the front porch of a house beside a homemade shrine to the Virgin of Charity that is lit up by dozens of votive candles.</p>

                        <p>Scenes of the rebel takeover of the city of Guantánamo where huge contingents of Batista's military forces were stationed during the course of the two-year civil war. The top two rows of frames show sandbags piled along the parapet wall of the military barracks in the center of Guantánamo, with soldiers surrendering weapons to revolutionary guerrillas beneath. Frames 3-27 are of particular interest because they reveal the Batista military's use of the rooftop of a public secondary school or Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza, of which there were less than two dozen nationwide, as a defensive outpost against possible rebel attacks on the city. None ever came. The building is surrounded by hundreds of civilian onlookers who listen to a hat-wearing rebel perched on the corner of the sandbagged rooftop as he addresses the crowds. Alongside him are not just rebels but batistiano soldiers who are distinguished by their metal helmets. See also Prints 40 and 44.</p>

                        <p>Rebel takeover of the city of Guantánamo where huge contingents of Batista's military forces were stationed during the course of the two-year civil war. The top row of frames shows crowds gathered before a public secondary school or Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza, whose roof is still covered with sandbags from the time that it apparently served as a defensive outpost against possible rebel attacks on the city. Frames 18-28 show crowds gathered around the highly unusual, homemade personnel carrier that Batista's forces designed but never used against the guerrillas during the last months of the war. Also significant is the image in frame 32 of a recently surrendered batistiano military officer walking away from the barracks with a suitcase under his arm, a towel around his neck and a metal fighting helmet in hand.

                        <p>This print depicts a government military barracks in the process of being taken over by 26th of July guerrillas who are engaged in confiscating all the available munitions, as well as questioning men who may be Batista's political prisoners through the bars of the prison cells. Because of their dress and general physical state, it is likely that these men were not taken prisoner by the rebels but were already there at the time of the government's military surrender. Although the precise location is not clear, the wall against which two rebel soldiers lean as they keep guard reads "Primera Compañía." The same location is featured in Print 17.

Top frames 33-34 show the front view of his car in what appears to be the early morning hours, as well as Fidel emerging from a middle-class home and standing behind the gate of the house with members of his personal escolta. Subsequent pictures show him speaking with small groups of civilians and rebels and frames 14-17 show the motorcade in movement and then stopping alongside the road. Frame 6 shows a rebel with rifle and beret seated underneath a large advertisement for "Hatuey" beer, owned by Bacardí Co., and frames 7-12 show nighttime scenes, probably preceding those in the top rows of frames, as Fidel's motorcade moves through a small town.</p>

                        <p>These pictures document the first, historic meeting of Fidel Castro and Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a judge whose support of the constitutionality of the rebels' assault on Batista's forces got him ousted from the bench and forced into exile in New York City. Fidel Castro had personally nominated Urrutia for the presidency of Cuba as early as 1957. In frames 21-35, Urrutia speaks with Fidel Castro; to the left of both stands Armando Hart, the son of another judge who suffered a fate similar to Urrutia's for having protested the unconstitutionality of Batista's government in support of the rebels years before. Urrutia speaks to reporters alongside the airplane Guíamaro, normally used as a presidential aircraft by Batista. See also Prints 18, 19, 27 and 50.</p>

                        <p>These pictures document the second historic meeting of Fidel Castro and Manuel Urrutia Lleó, a judge whose support of the constitutionality of the rebels' assault on Batista's forces got him ousted from the bench and forced into exile in New York City. Fidel Castro had personally nominated Urrutia for the presidency of Cuba as early as 1957. In frames 21-35, one sees Urrutia speaking with Fidel Castro; to the left of both stands Armando Hart, the son of another judge who suffered a fate similar to Urrutia's for having protested the unconstitutionality of Batista's government in support of the rebels years before. In the top row of the print, frames 23-24 show Haydée Santamaría, Armando Hart's fiancé and legendary heroine of the 1953 assault on the Cuartel Moncada. Frame 25 shows the bearded Comandante Faustino Pérez, later Minister of the Ministry of Ill-Gotten Goods (Ministerio de Bienes Malversados), which oversaw the redistribution of millions of dollars of property confiscated from supporters and officials of the Batista regime.

                        <p>Frames 17 through 35 appear to show the rebel takeover of a government facility although the location is not clear. Featured in frames 17 through 26 are two Catholic priests in robes, speaking to rebels and a female reporter (wearing an armband that says 'prensa'). Frames 28-35 show Celia Sánchez in fatigues as she talks to the same female reporter. Bottom frames show the interior view of the room from whose balcony Fidel Castro addressed the nation on January 1, 1959, in Santiago de Cuba. See also Prints 9, 20, 22, 31-32 and 41.</p>

                        <p>Frames 4 through 13 of this print show Roberto Agramonte, the Revolution's first Minister of Foreign Relations, meetings with other Cuban men, possibly advisors and new government officials, as they gather in a home, converse and discuss documents. Frames 14-23 appear to have been taken as St. George accompanied Agramonte to the airport and feature a number of "portrait shots" of unidentified passengers, a pilot (frames 14-15), reporters and at least one rebel (frame 16-17). Frames 19-20 show Agramonte as he boards the plane.</p>

Frames 3-4, 8-9, 11-14 convey various scenes from inside a prison that is still under the watch of two Batista officials (seen keeping watch at a table in frames 8-9). Frames 5-7 show the street outside the prison where a jeep is parked and hundreds of people are gathering. See also Prints 55, 56, 57 and 58.</p>

                        <p>These prints all relate to one of the first press conferences given by the revolutionary alliance of guerrillas, civilian leaders and members of the Catholic hierarchy at the Havana Hilton shortly after Fidel's victorious entrance into Havana. Print 61 shows an unidentified man wearing civilian clothes as he is being interviewed; the print includes a slightly out-of-focus picture of Andrew St. George, probably taken by himself to test the camera. Print 62 shows Fidel sitting with a panel of officials as they are greeted by admiring citizens at the Havana Hilton, probably moments before the press conference. Prints 63 and 64 show the press conference itself. Sitting to Fidel's immediate right is the Archbishop of Havana (see especially frames 16-19). They are joined by a number of other unidentified men in business suits. In both Prints 63 and 64, reporters are seen approaching the panel with a microphone and asking their questions at close range, apparently so that they could be filmed in the same shot as Fidel Castro for television.</p>

                        <p>This print shows the context of popular fervor in which Fidel is speaking as a massive crowd floods the street in front of him. In frame 3, St. George has marked the figure of Fidel with a handwritten arrow made with a blue pen. These images appear to show the city of Santa Clara and were probably taken on one of the last stops Fidel would make as he and his motorcade made their way to Havana for the declaration of the rebel victory.</p>

                        <p>These prints feature incredible panoramic shots of Fidel's speech at a rally to denounce United States officials and press for criticizing the trials and denouncing the executions of former officials, police and intelligence agents of the fallen dictator and former United States ally, Fulgencio Batista. Fidel speaks from a platform on the grounds in front of the Presidential Palace before a sea of one million Cubans with Camilo Cienfuegos in cowboy hat at his side. Frames 16 &amp; 17 of Print 69 show a sign to the right of Fidel and Camilo, plus another group that reads "Fidel, Martí y Maceo" with faces of both 19th century heroes flanking Fidel's face in center. Some of the writing says "Hoy!...justicia si!...piedad!" The same sign can be seen in frames 14 &amp; 15 of Print 71, taken earlier in the day when the demonstrations began. It is likely that Fidel announced "Operation Truth" at this rally on January 13, 1959. "Operation Truth" was a plan to invite all interested foreign press to come to Cuba and witness the people's support for revolutionary justice against the Batistianos first hand. Print 72 features closeup images of some of the signs protestors held, such as a banner reading "American People Believe in Us" (frame 14). It also shows members of the organization of Cuban university students, or FEU, a major target of state terror under Batista, pretending to tie a noose around one student's neck and inviting this treatment for former police, military and officials of Batista.

                        <p>These prints document Fidel Castro's record five-hour press conference for foreign reporters participating in "Operation Truth" in the ballroom of a Havana hotel. "Operation Truth" represented Fidel Castro and the revolutionary government's response to the furious attacks in the foreign media and by United States officials on the summary trials and executions of former officers, police agents and intelligence agents responsible for state repression under Fulgencio Batista. Launched as a counter-campaign meant to bring the press to Cuba to witness the trials and their popularity among Cubans, "Operation Truth" paid the travel costs out of Cuban government coffers of all foreign reporters who would come. Fidel Castro at center; others present include all of the members of the original revolutionary government, including President Manuel Urrutia and Minister of the Treasury Rufo López Fresquet.

                        <p>Overview shots of the public trials of Batistiano officials held in Havana's National Stadium. This trial in particular was held on January 14, 1959, before 18,000 spectators and members of the international press corps. The man tried was Captain Jesús Sosa Blanco, commander of the military garrison in Holguín, Oriente Province, and one of the most despised batistiano officials on the island. Calling the plan "Operation Truth," Fidel Castro had personally invited members of the international press to witness the trials and come to Cuba at the revolutionary government's expense. Operation Truth was launched earlier that week with the mass rally in support of the executions and trials of Batista's agents, largely considered war criminals and torturers by the public, depicted in Prints 69-75. The trials were the subject of an intense United States-led campaign to discredit the Cuban revolutionary government, but were immensely popular among Cubans. Fidel Castro and other members of the guerrilla movement presided over the trials; witnesses present included family members of Cubans who had been captured, tortured and had disappeared at the hands of the very men being tried.

                        <p>Captain Jesús Sosa Blanco, commander of Batista's military garrison in Holguín, stands handcuffed before his accusers in public trial and attempts to defend himself before the microphone. Sosa Blanco famously asked for clemency while ridiculing the trial, saying that he felt like a Christian in Roman times being thrown into a den of lions. This trial was held January 14th, 1959, at Havana's National Stadium. See also Prints 69-75, 81-82, 85-91.</p>

                        <p>Flown in from Oriente Province at the government's behest, family members of Jesús Sosa Blanco's victims are seen as they testify before the accused in public trial at Havana's national sports stadium on January 14, 1959. The stadium was selected as the location for the event because it had the greatest number of seats. Several of these witnesses are shown pointing to the men being held by guerrilla rebels and identifying them as their relatives' murderers. Frames 17-20 depict the entrance to the national sports arena as cars gather and people make their way inside. Frame 21 shows two women wearing black and holding a photograph and long newspaper article detailing the horrors of their relative's murder at the hands of Batista's police forces. The same women appear in images with much better lighting on Print 86, frames 17-20. See also Prints 69-75, 81-84, 86-91.</p>

Top frames show a young man wearing a checkered shirt pointing as he testifies to the horrors committed by Jesús Sosa Blanco against a relative during the Batista years. The second row of images features two frames (9-10) in which the boy is being restrained from assaulting the defendant by several members of Castro's guerrillas. Frames 13-15 show a reporter talking to Fidel Castro's son, Fidelito, as he observes the public trials of batistianos. Frames 11-12 show Raúl Chibás with two unidentified guerrillas as they preside over the trial. The trial formed part of "Operation Truth" and took place at Havana's national sports stadium, selected because it had the greatest number of seats. See also Prints 69-75, 81-87, 89-91.</p>

                        <p>Fidel Castro's trip to Venezuela. Castro had been invited by Rear-Admiral Wolfgang Larrazabal, former president of the governing junta that had taken power in 1958 after the overthrow of the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. The Venezuelans wanted Fidel to visit their country on the first anniversary of that event, January 23, 1959. Castro complied, although in doing so he missed his brother Raúl Castro's long-anticipated wedding to fellow rebel Vilma Espín on January 26. Print 92, motorcade from airport to lunch meeting with Venezuelan officials in Caracas, January 23, 1959; photographs appear to be taken from inside Fidel's car. Prints 93, 96, 101, 108, lunch meeting of Fidel Castro with Venezuelan officials and Rear-Admiral Wolfgang Larrazabal, Caracas, January 23, 1959. Prints 94, 95, 102, 104, 106, Fidel meets with anti-Trujillista exiles from the Dominican Republic in Venezuela. Photographs clearly show the Dominican flag as well as Venezuelan flags (especially Prints 94, 95, 104). Print 102 shows Fidel leaving the lunch meeting and his motorcade driving to a meeting with Dominicans and being assailed by bystanders along the way. Print 104 shows a truck carrying Fidel arriving at a guarded facility (appears to be a privately owned plant of some kind because of signage that warns against entering the "empresa" grounds) for private talks with the Dominicans, passing through the gates and moving away from the crowds. Prints 97, 98, 103, 107, 110, 111, 113, 114 depict the massive crowds that greeted Fidel Castro from the moment he arrived at the Caracas airport through the course of his visit and speech in an open-air plaza (see especially Prints 113 and 114). In addition, Prints 99, 100 and 112 are significant for their depiction of the intimacy that Chief of the Cuban Air Force, Pedro Díaz Lanz, enjoyed at that time with Fidel Castro. Díaz Lanz was a pilot who became a revolutionary hero when he and Huber Matos brought badly needed weapons and supplies to the guerrillas in April 1958 with the help of the President of Costa Rica. In Print 99, Díaz Lanz and his wife prepare to accompany Fidel to Venezuela as fellow passengers on a commercial aircraft. Charged with nepotism and other corruption, Díaz Lanz deserted his post in early July 1959 and flew to Miami where he accused the revolutionary government of harboring Communists and claimed to have left for that reason alone. Díaz Lanz became a hero to the batistiano exiles who made much of his "defection," widely seen in Cuba as a betrayal. Print 105 shows St. George and other reporters covering Fidel's Venezuela trip.</p>

                        <p>The former (now abandoned) estate of dictator Fulgencio Batista. In addition to the fabulous wealth and grandeur of the furnishings displayed in all the prints, Prints 115 and 116 are interesting for another reason: St. George visited the estate in the company of his wife (see Print 115) and his oldest son, who is seen laughing and standing in the niche created by the walls of a fireplace (see frames 20-24 of Print 116). St. George himself is visible in the great mirror hanging over the fireplace. Print 117 features exterior shots of the buildings and grounds (frames 2-16), as well as seating areas on the margins of a central table in frames 12, 29-31. Batista apparently lined a central patio of the house with marble busts of great historical liberators, seen in frame 8 of print 117 and frames 4-7 of Print 120. Print 118 shows the magnificence of Batista's wine cellar, as well as the magnitude of his wife's purse collection in frames 5-18. Frames 10-22 of Print 119 reveal the interior of Batista's personal office; on the wall behind the desk hangs a portrait of Batista himself as he appeared when he first ensured and then betrayed the 1933 Revolution against the first of Cuba's United States-supported dictators, Gerardo Machado. Print 120 also has a number of images of Batista's office (frames 23-25), as well as vistas of the marbled hallways and immaculate former bedchambers of the dictator. St. George provided the Cuban magazine Bohemia with many of these photographs for its early "Liberty Editions," published between mid-January and early February 1959.</p>

                        <p>This collection of prints documents Fidel Castro's trip to Venezuela that began on January 23, 1959, with his arrival at Maiqueta airport in Caracas (see Book 3). Although revolutionary forces had just taken power in Cuba, Fidel Castro made his visit a priority and scheduled it to coincide with the first anniversary of the fall of Venezuela's ten-year dictatorship under General Marcos Pérez Jiménez on the 23 of January 1958 after a successful two-day general strike. One of the principal reasons for Castro's visit to Venezuela was to encourage support for multi-country cooperation in the organization, financing and training of invasion forces who could topple the remaining Caribbean dictatorships of Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti, the Somoza brothers in Nicaragua and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic (where both Fulgencio Batista of Cuba and Pérez Jiménez of Venezuela had fled before seeking permanent exile in Franco's Spain). Such attempted invasions did take place over the next year and a half, although all of them failed. In this set of prints, Prints 1-7 show Fidel Castro giving formal speeches before a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress in the Chamber of Deputies (see especially Prints 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and holding public meetings with local officials at the Palacio de Miraflores (especially Prints 9, 10, 18). Frames 13 and 14 of Print 10 show Fidel Castro flanked by Colonel Pedro José Quevedo and Captain of the Venezuelan Navy Miguel Rodríguez on his left and Cuban Ambassador Pividal on his right. Print 15 depicts Fidel and Venezuelan hosts having dinner at a long banquet table in an unusually sparse room at an unidentified location: the room features walls made of wooden planks; against the wall behind the speakers' table hang both the Cuban and Venezuelan flags. In frames 17 and 22 of Print 15, Fidel Castro is seen in the middle of the table with Celia Sánchez to his left. The press is also a significant presence, crowding around the front of the table. Prints 16 and 17 show Fidel Castro holding a private, two-hour meeting with Venezuela's new President Romulo Betancourt, elected only a few months earlier in a race against the candidate who had headed the military opposition that toppled Pérez Jiménez, Wolfgang Larrazabal (see Contact Book III). The meeting with Betancourt took place in his personal residence, an estate known as Marítmar in Caracas, on Sunday, the last night of Castro's visit. In his accompanying notes for this Contact Book, St. George pays special attention to Fidel Castro's speech at the Aula Magna of the University of Caracas, a visit documented in Prints 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14. In this group, Print 13 shows administrators of the university presenting Castro certificate of "Honor al Mérito" (frames 13-18, 23-24) and guerrilla members of his entourage enjoying milk shakes at the university cafeteria as the uniformed cafeteria staff crowds around their table (frames 3-4). According to St. George's notes, Fidel opted to remove his military cap and wear a beret in deference to the university's recent victory in gaining guarantees of institutional and political autonomy from the Venezuelan state over the last year. The beret was, in fact, a gift from the Orfeón Universitario, a student singing group that hailed Castro's arrival. Present at Castro's talk was Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet. St. George also attests to the fact that Castro used the opportunity to announce his support for the training of a Dominican invasion force and introduced the Dominican-born captain of his rebel army, Enrique Jiménez, as its leader. Further images and direct citation of St. George's notes on this matter may be found in the description for Prints 34 and 37. See also Book 3, Prints 34 and 37.</p>

                        <p>Second and third rows of images are unrelated to the rest of the print and show members of the guerrilla army guarding and posing on the grounds of the Hotel Nacional in Havana where the photographer St. George was most likely staying. Other images depict a press conference with Fidel Castro and other officials of the newly formed revolutionary government held on March 6, 1959, at Castro's personal villa and sometime-headquarters during that period in Cojímar. Frames marked 1-3 in the second-to-last row depict the press conference and the last two rows show Fidel Castro greeting admiring guests and signing a woman's cast (frames 16 to 17) in the moments following the conference. Frames 21 and 22 show St. George taking a cat-nap in a lounge chair in a room adjacent to the room in which the press and officials are assembled. See also Prints 25, 26, 27 and 28.</p>

                        <p>These prints document the arrival of the newly appointed United States Ambassador to Cuba, Philip W. Bonsal, at the Presidential Palace on March 5, 1959. Bonsal replaced Earl E.T. Smith whose close personal relationship and support for Fulgencio Batista throughout the dictatorship sullied his reputation among Cubans and made him the target of uniformly negative media attacks after the end of the Batista regime and the re-emergence of an uncensored free press in Cuba. After Smith resigned, Bonsal, who was fluent in Spanish, arrived in Havana on February 19, 1959, and presented his credentials to President Manuel Urrutia Lleó at the Presidential Palace on the occasion documented in this print (see especially 22-23). Frames 15-19 and 20-25 of Print 24 show Urrutia and Bonsal sitting and conversing together with Roberto Agramonte, a former professor of sociology at the University of Havana who had been the favored presidential candidate of the Orthodox Party in the 1952 election that ended with the staging of Batista's March 10th coup. Agramonte subsequently became Cuba's first Foreign Minister of the revolutionary government until he and several other ministers were removed from their positions by Prime Minister Fidel Castro on June 11, 1959, for unannounced reasons. The top row of frames in Print 24 shows Fidel Castro giving a press conference in an unidentified location with Teresa Casuso, his English-language translator and special assistant for public affairs for the first six months of the Revolution, at his side (see frame 4).</p>

In frame 26, Fidel is seen checking his watch while talking to the Ambassador. Remaining frame 18 in the fifth row from the top and frames 12-17 show Agramonte and Bonsal conversing alone. In frames 4-11, Agramonte and Bonsal are seen conversing in the same room where the press conference was held with Humberto Sorí Marín, former President of the Inter-American Bar Association, who served as one of Fidel Castro's top commanders during their early months in the Sierra Maestra and presided over the revolutionary tribunals convened to try common criminals and traitors in the Sierra (see Contact Book I). At the time of Bonsal and Agramonte's meeting with Sorí Marín, the latter was rapidly becoming the central architect for the Revolution's planned Agrarian Reform, passed in May of 1959. He would later be arrested and executed summarily in March of 1961 for conspiring with the CIA and exile groups against the Revolution. See also Prints 19, 25, 27 and 28.</p>

                        <p>This print documents the presence of an arms dealer named Col. Hubert F. Julian in Havana. The subjects of this print seem unaware of the fact that they are being photographed. In his description for this print, St. George writes, "With war winds approaching, tourists are becoming scarce again in Cuba, and their places are taken by businesslike heralds of trouble: in the ornate hall of Havana's Nacional Hotel, devoid of tourists, Col. Hubert F. Julian, a "Reg. U.S. Arms Dealer" sits alone, accompanied only by a pair of bodyguards who came with him from Florida. Best known as the 'Black Eagle,' Col. Julian is not only a 'Reg. U.S. Arms dealer' he is the Latino revolution's surest harbinger and most faithful supplier. These days, traveling through Haiti, Santo Domingo, Cuba, Nicaragua, he sells everything from jet Vampires to machetes. Business is brisk. (From top down, first, fourth and sixth frame rows: shots with bodyguards, bottom row left.) Second row from top is Col. Julian cashing check at cashier's window of Hotel Nacional and joking with passing acquaintance (unidentified, obviously: she was from Virginia). Other frames of Colonel in Nacional lobby, largely irrelevant." See also Prints 30, 31, 32, 34 and 37.</p>

                        <p>This print shows exiled Spanish General Alberto Bayo, who had fought with the Republican forces in Spain before their defeat at the hands of Franco's Fascists, waiting for a meeting with Cuba's first President of the Revolution, Manuel Urrutia, in the Presidential Palace of Havana. Bayo had helped Fidel Castro's guerrilla force with its training during their exile in Mexico between 1953 and 1956. In his notes for this print, St. George writes, "The dean of military exiles in Cuba-and the one with the biggest project-is Spanish General Alberto Bayo, who is working with anti-Franco exile groups to intensify the active resistance in Spain and overthrow Franco. General Bayo was the military professional who trained Castro's original invasion troop in Mexico, he has had a hand in several other Caribbean 'actions' and he is an elder statesman of revolution in the Caribbean. He is wearing the uniform of a Spanish Loyalist brigadier general, but to the many kids he's helped train he is always "El Viejo"-the old man. Bayo's work is already contributing to the growing anti-fascist resistance in Spain, and he has plans to set up a Castro-exile guerrilla force somewhere in the mountains near the French border. It is certain that whatever he tries, he won't lack for volunteers. The frames of this strip show the General waiting in the anteroom of Cuban President Manuel Urrutia; he had an hour-long talk with the President. Bayo (beard) is at right; other unidentified."

                        <p>Images of Fidel Castro's speech at the Aula Magna of the University of Caracas in Venezuela. According to St. George, a highpoint in Fidel Castro's speech was the condemnation of the decades-long dictatorship of the U.S.-trained and U.S.-supported Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, as well as the announcement of his support for the creation of an invasion force of Dominican exiles, to be led by Cuban volunteers and financed abroad. In his description for the print, St. George writes, "Three weeks after his triumph in Cuba, Castro visited Caracas, Venezuela, where he lit the fire under the first (and still his favorite) of the brewing revolutions: the planned guerrilla invasion against dictatorial Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo's Dominican Republic. On this strip is shown the historic moment as Castro launched the campaign: having inserted an unexpected and fiery outburst against Trujillo into an address in the Aula Magna of Caracas University, he ends it by picking of his own campaign hat (he has exchanged it for a beret while in the aula, in deference to college tradition) placing it on the lectern and tossing a five-bolivar note into it (Frames marked 1 and 2). He accepts the first contribution to his newly established fund for a Dominican guerrilla army from rear admiral Wolfgang Lazrrazabal, Venezuela's own (if beardless) military hero. (Frames marked 3 and 4). Then Castro triumphantly introduces his candidate for Commander-in-Chief of the Dominican rebel army, Enrique Jiménez. Frames 4 and 5, Jiménez to Castro's left. At this writing (early April 1959), Jiménez, now a Comandante, is running a top-security, barbed-wire training camp for future Dominican guerrilla warriors on the outskirts of Santa Clara, in central Las Villas province. Except for being Castro's handpicked choice, he's a relative newcomer to the Dominican exile command, where envious compatriots have dubbed him 'Fidel's Dominican Gauleiter.'" In this print, frames that St. George designates as having "marked" show his own handwritten enumeration over the image in colored wax pencil. See also Prints 1-18, 37, and Contact Book III.</p>

                        <p>Taken in the first days after the fall of Batista and the assumption of power by revolutionary forces, these images appear to show the peaceful transfer of power of a major military base, probably Camp Columbia, to revolutionary forces headed by Camilo Cienfuegos, especially in frames 6-17 in third and fourth rows from the top. In the second row of frames, members of the rebel army advance forward on the left side of the frame while soldiers from Batista's surrendering army stand at attention to the right. Camilo Cienfuegos is seen at the center of frames 12-14 in the third row and arriving by the plane Sierra Maestra in frames 3-5 in the top row.</p>

                        <p>According to St. George's description notes on this sheet, the top and bottom frames depict a group of guerrillas trained and financed by Fidel Castro, with Ernest "Che" Guevara overseeing operations. The guerrillas' purpose was eventually to topple the remaining dictatorships in the circum-Caribbean area, including the Somozas in Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Regarding frames 8-10 and 3-7, St. George writes: "Invasion group made up of Caribbean refugees and Cubans being trained in secret camp near Havana. Some of these men were part of the recent invasion of Panama [which occurred while Fidel Castro was visiting the United States in April of 1959; Fidel later denied responsibility]. Others participated in the abortive Nicaraguan invasion [of May 1959]. They are being trained by a Cuban Army Sergeant (front row middle in uniform)." Further documentation of the abortive revolutionary effort in late May 1959 in Nicaragua can be found in Contact Book X, Prints 1-29. All other frames in this print (19-30) depict a conversation between Louis Dejoie, a former Haitian senator (see most clearly on the far-right of frame 22, wearing a bowtie), talking to Jerry Hannifin, a Time-Life correspondent for Latin America. According to St. George, Dejoie was in Havana for secret meetings with Ernesto "Che" Guevara who ran operations for a covert guerrilla financing and training base out of a heavily guarded beach villa in Tarará, about 20 miles outside of Havana along the Vía Blanca. There, Guevara worked with a small team of six staff officers. "No signs or directories indicate this address and the phone switchboard number is not listed anywhere but day and night exiled politicians, soldiers of fortune, U.S ex-paratroopers looking for a war, officers on the run from former dictator bosses, inventors with new demolition gadgets, come and go here from Nicaragua, Haiti, Costa Rica, Santo Domingo, Mexico and often from such neighboring states as Florida and Texas. Castro calls Guevara his 'military coordinator'-Guevara says, 'I'm the man in charge of impossible projects.'" See also Prints 29, 30, 31, 32, 34 and 35.</p>

                        <p>Taken in the first days of January 1959 after the fall of Batista and the triumph of revolutionary forces, these images document the reunion of Raúl Castro and his fiancée and underground revolutionary coordinator for the province of Oriente, Vilma Espín, at an airport in an unidentified city, probably the former air force base of Camp Columbia in Havana. Prints 9-12 show Vilma in the company of an unidentified older woman who embraces Raúl upon seeing him in Print 7. Print 39 shows an earlier phase in this event, when Raúl first descends the ladder from the military aircraft on which he has arrived, together with other rebels. See also Print 39.</p>

                        <p>These prints relate to the trial by Revolutionary Tribunal of an unidentified U.S. citizen, possibly one of two CIA agents who regularly reported to Batista's intelligence network known as SIM [Servicio de Inteligencia Militar], under cover provided by the U.S. embassy. The accused is eventually deported to the United States rather than executed as were most Cubans tried for war crimes and atrocities by Revolutionary Tribunals in the early months of the Revolution. Despite rendering guilty verdicts, deportation remained the preferred option for revolutionary judges dealing with U.S. citizens accused of aiding in citizen surveillance, disappearances or other abuses on behalf of Batista rather than lengthy jail sentences or execution during this period. Prints 53 and 54 document the rendering of the verdict and the man's eventual release from La Cabaña fortress where the trial took place, his arrival at a hotel in Havana, and departure by what appears to be a private plane, apparently for the United States.</p>

                        <p>Images showing Fidel Castro at the front table and part of the audience that attended his appearance at the National Press Club luncheon in Washington, D.C. There were over 600 people present as he spoke. Fidel Castro made the trip, together with a large entourage of well over a hundred people, on April 14, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Fidel remained in the United States for more than two weeks, eventually touring cities on the eastern seaboard such as Boston, Princeton, New Jersey and New York City.

                        <p>This print documents Fidel Castro's televised appearance on the NBC news show "Meet the Press." Pictured in all frames on this print, to the left, is veteran journalist May Craig, who during the course of the program, aggressively asked Fidel Castro whether his brother, Raúl Castro, was a Communist. Fidel then replied that if his brother was a Communist, he would know about it. Other men seated with Castro are host Mr. Brooks and Anthony Hervas, serving as Fidel Castro's interpreter. Fidel Castro made the trip to Washington, D.C., in mid-April, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

                        <p>This print appears to show Fidel Castro being interviewed by members of the international press, probably before television cameras. The two reporters seated to his immediate right have Spanish surnames (Agustín Tamaigo? and Juan Quintal?), although their name plates are hardly visible. Next to Castro on the desk is a name plate reading "Radio Rebelde," the formerly underground radio station in Cuba through which Castro's guerrillas transmitted uncensored reports from a clandestine location in the Sierra Maestra. The location of this event is not known, although it likely took place in early 1959.</p>

                        <p>Top frames of this sheet show Fidel Castro addressing an audience of over 600 at a luncheon held in his honor at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in mid-April, 1959. In the third, fifth and sixth rows of images, Fidel Castro makes a televised appearance on the NBC news show "Meet the Press." Other men seated with Castro are host Mr. Brooks and Anthony Hervas, serving as Fidel Castro's interpreter. To the left, are three journalists who questioned Castro during the program. The woman on the left with the hat is veteran journalist May Craig. Frames 3-7 in the fourth row of images show Fidel Castro enjoying a meal in his bedroom, ostensibly at the Cuban Embassy in Washington, with a copy of the Cuban newspaper Prensa Libre on his lap. The top headline reads "No capitalismo. No comunismo. Cubanismo" and pictures Fidel Castro carrying a baby wearing a bonnet, an image taken while he was in Washington, D.C., and departing the Cuban Embassy on foot while surrounded by a large crowd of curious Americans (see Contact Book V, Print 1, Frame #34). Fidel Castro made the trip to Washington, D.C., in mid-April, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Fidel remained in the United States for more than two weeks, eventually touring cities on the eastern seaboard such as Boston, Princeton, New Jersey and New York City.

                        <p>This print shows Fidel Castro making a visit to the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington D.C. In this print, the massive crowd of on-lookers, companions, bodyguards, police and reporters that followed Fidel to the Memorial can be seen as they make their way up the steps, with the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument behind them (see frames 5-13). Fidel Castro made the trip, together with a large entourage of well over a hundred people, on April 14, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Fidel remained in the United States for more than two weeks, eventually touring cities on the eastern seaboard such as Boston, Princeton, New Jersey and New York City. For other images of Fidel Castro's trip to Washington and New York, see Prints 55-78 and Contact Book V; for other images of his visit to the Lincoln Memorial, see Prints 55, 58 and 68.</p>

                        <p>This print contains a large number of frames that are double-exposed (frames 20-22, 23-25). They show two different events: Fidel Castro addressing an audience of over 600 at the National Press Club luncheon held in Washington, D.C., in his honor and his speech before the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which was responsible for inviting him to the United States in mid-April 1959. The latter address was given at the Statler Hilton; seated next to Fidel and visible in frames 34-37 were Rufo López Fresquet (wearing glasses), Cuba's Minister of the Treasury, and Teresa Casuso, Fidel Castro's personal assistant in charge of public relations and translator throughout the trip. López Fresquet can be seen more clearly in frame 15.

                        <p>Fidel Castro eating a large meal, including rice and beans, while talking with staff in his bedroom at what appears to be the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. Fidel Castro made the trip, together with a large entourage of well over a hundred people, on April 14, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Fidel remained in the United States for more than two weeks, eventually touring cities on the eastern seaboard such as Boston, Princeton, New Jersey and New York City.

The top, third and sixth rows of frames depict U.S. citizens carrying picket signs and protesting on the sidewalk in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel where Fidel Castro was speaking at a luncheon held by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. In a subsequent speech given in Central Park, New York City, Fidel claimed that the picketers were college students being paid $17 an hour for their time by pro-Batista groups seeking to discredit the Revolution as "communist."

                           <p>Taken during Fidel Castro's trip to the United States that began with a visit to Washington, D.C., in mid-April, this print shows U.S. citizens carrying picket signs and protesting on the sidewalk in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel where Fidel Castro was speaking at a luncheon held by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. In a subsequent speech given in Central Park, New York City, Fidel claimed that the picketers were American college students who were paid $17 an hour for their time by pro-Batista groups seeking to discredit the Revolution as "communist." Picket signs include the phrases "The commies are coming! They are with Fidel!"; "Fidel's beard hides a red face!"; "Castro says that anything that is wrong with Cuba is caused by the U.S."; "Fidelism. Revolutionism. Communism"; "Fidel-Newest dictator in western hemisphere"; "Castro says imperialistic U.S. a bad neighbor"; and "with friends like Fidel, the U.S. needs no enemies!" Frames 26 and 27 depict three police officers guarding the entrance to the ballroom in which Fidel is speaking. See also Prints 4 and 12.</p>

                        <p>Top four rows of frames show part of the face of an unidentified balding man, probably an American, peering through the window of a door that appears to have no knob, but only a lock on the outside. It is possible that the man is a prisoner, although the grill on the door appears decorative and made of wood. Remaining frames show the aftermath of night-time street celebrations in Havana, possibly during Carnival of 1959. Frames 38-39 were taken from the corner of San Rafael Boulevard, looking northward on Prado. To the left of these frames is the terrace of the Hotel Inglaterra; the wooden frames used to separate seating for tourists and other on-lookers who would watch as carnival dancers and floats passed by.</p>

                           <p>Taken during Fidel Castro's trip to the United States that began with a visit to Washington, D.C., in mid-April, the first, fifth, and sixth rows of this print (as well as frame 22 of the bottom row) show U.S. citizens carrying picket signs and protesting on the sidewalk in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel where Fidel Castro was speaking at a luncheon held by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. In a subsequent speech given in Central Park, New York City, Fidel claimed that the picketers were American college students who were paid $17 an hour for their time by pro-Batista groups seeking to discredit the Revolution as "communist." Phrases used on the picket signs include: "Castro is the red Oppressor of Cuba!"; "Reds digging in U.S. back yard with help of Castro"; "Fidel Castro Red Puppet" and "We don't like beards. Barbers of America." Frame 36 shows three police men guarding the entrance to the ballroom where Fidel was speaking. The second row of frames and frames 8, 9, 10 of the third row show Fidel Castro surrounded by reporters, security and other embassy functionaries at the foot of the central staircase at the Cuban Embassy in Washington. Frames 11-17 and frames 18-21, 22 show Fidel Castro sitting and talking with President Eisenhower's recently appointed Secretary of State Christian A. Herter, who later hosted a lunch at his home for Fidel. See also Prints 4, 8, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.</p>

Only a few signs are completely legible, such as ones reading "Communist Fidel Castro is ready to negotiate Cuba's sugar with Russia"; "Now Cuba is the Hungary of America"; and "We Israeli and Jews Anti-Communist protest for Castro's Red Operations." In all frames, city police are seen interspersed with the protestors. The reason for their presence may be the staging of a counter-protest in what appears to be the same area, on the other side of the street. See also Print 16.</p>

                           <p>Top three rows of frames show Fidel Castro addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors' annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Fidel originally made the trip, together with a large entourage of well over a hundred people, on April 14, 1959, in response to the invitation of Jules Dubois, editor of the Chicago Tribune and then president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Subsequent frames depict Fidel Castro at the reception held at the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C., for Cubans sent into exile by Batista's use of political terror against opponents. Much of the invited exile community had supported Castro's guerrillas financially from abroad. Frames 17-22 show a particularly warm and intimate encounter between Fidel and an unidentified blonde woman wearing a white feather hat. See also Prints 12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.</p>

                           <p>Top two rows of images show Fidel Castro visiting the U.S. Capitol building and frame 13 of the third row shows Castro entering a car marked "Department of State 1." Remaining images show a pro-Fidel demonstration in which participants appear to be Dominicans driven into exile by the political terror of the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic. By the time of Fidel's visit, it was known that he publicly supported the training of guerrillas to topple the Trujillo regime, which had been hosting Fulgencio Batista and other high officials of the Batista dictatorship's intelligence divisions since the time of their escape from Cuba on January 1, 1959. Signs held by the picketers read "Nuestro lema Dios, Patria y Libertad"; "27 de Febrero Saluda a Fidel"; "1844 Independence 1959 Liberation"; "Democracy Yes Trujillo No"; "Cuban justice Batista style" (with accompanying image of anti-civilian violence); and "There's an iron curtain in Europe. A bamboo in China and a Sugar Cane Curtain in the Dominican Republic." See also Print 14.</p>

                           <p>Frame 13 of the top row shows Andrew St. George sitting on the ground with a press band on his left forearm accompanied by an unidentified Cuban. They appear to be awaiting the arrival of Fidel at the airport following his highly successful, four-week visit to the United States and Argentina. Images in frames 9-12 show helmeted members of a national police force as they wait to receive Fidel Castro; frames 4-6 show Fidel Castro descending from the plane at a distance with men bearing the flag of the "Policía Nacional Revolucionaria" amidst the large crowd gathered on the tarmac. The bottom frames provide close-up shots of an unidentified light-eyed guerrilla sporting a particularly impressive beard as well as a close-up of Fidel Castro and other officials waving triumphantly from the podium in front of the monument to José Martí in what was then called the Plaza Cívica in Havana. This image documents Fidel's address to the nation given almost immediately upon his return to Cuba from the United States and Argentina. See also Prints 24, 26, 27, 28 and 29.</p>

                           <p>Contains two identical contact sheets. Fidel Castro and accompanying officials on the train north from Washington, D.C. to Princeton, New Jersey, where Fidel will give a number of public speeches to increasingly larger crowds of Americans. From New Jersey, Fidel continued to New York City where Columbia University's invitation that Fidel Castro speak drew such interest that the location had to be moved to Central Park and finally to Boston where Fidel visited and gave a speech at Harvard University. Here, in frames 25-33, Fidel Castro is seen eating in the dining car with Rufo López Fresquet, the first Minister of the Treasury under the revolutionary government, at his side. Frames 5-7 show Fidel's arrival at the station and remaining frames 6-8 appear to show seats in the salon where Fidel will deliver an address in New York City (for other images related to that address, see Print 39).

Bottom three rows of frames depict Fidel's departure from New Jersey by train and street scenes of welcoming picketers outside the Statler Hilton, where Fidel apparently stayed once in New York City City.

                           <p>Scenes of Fidel Castro's departure from Washington and arrival in New York City by train during the second-to-last leg of his tour of the United States from April 14-26, 1959. He returned to Cuba after visiting Argentina in early May of 1959. Frames 13-15 show the faces of excited Cuban exiles, many of whom supported the Revolution financially from abroad, and to whom Fidel promised he would return victorious when he first canvassed New York City's Cuban community in 1955 for start-up funds for his guerrilla war. Frame 13 shows one of them holding a sign that reads "Fidel Directorio Revolucionario te saluda." Frames 31 and 32 show Fidel as he boards a dark car amidst heavy security in front of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank in Manhattan. See also Prints 30, 31, 33 and 35.</p>

                        <p>These contact sheets document the trial by Revolutionary Tribunal in Cuba of two U.S. fighter pilots who had served in World War II and who organized a counterrevolutionary guerrilla force, apparently under the cover of the CIA, for the purpose of toppling the Castro-led government in September of 1959. The focus of their operations was Lajas, a small village in the municipality of Consolación del Sur near the mountain range known as la Cordillera de los Organos, province of Pinar del Río, in the fall of 1959. Prints 1 and 2 show the men in clear close-up. Frames 18-22 in the first row and all frames in the third, fourth and fifth rows of Print 1 depict Peter Lambton, standing to the left of his government-appointed lawyer and a member of the revolutionary militia who is apparently questioning him before a microphone in the presence of the tribunal (see Prints 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 6, 7). Frames in the second row (unnumbered except for no. 29) depict Austin Young. Austin Young was originally arrested and confined to La Cabaña fortress in Havana on March 27, 1959, for helping members of the Batista regime accused of war crimes, such as torture and corruption, escape to the United States rather than stand trial and face probable execution in Cuba. A short time later, Young was deported to the United States as an act of good will on the part of the Cuban government. Accompanied by Peter Lambton, Young later resurfaced under the false name of "Russell Gardner" on September 13, 1959, in Varadero, Cuba, where they entered the country for the purpose of recruiting and coordinating a guerrilla unit among former batistianos and peasants worried about the possibility of losing their land to a government they feared was Communist. Young, Lambton and a Cuban national named Pruna Bertot, who had also faced imprisonment in La Cabaña but escaped from prison seven days before the former's arrival in Cuba, comprised the leadership of the counterrevolutionary conspirators in Cuba. Pruna Bertot appears in Print 7, frames 27, 28, 29, to the left of Young, Lambton and an unidentified man wearing glasses with a slight moustache. Print 7 also shows a peasant rendering testimony before the tribunal, a black man wearing a long-sleeved shirt standing before a microphone; it is not clear whether he was a witness presenting evidence or one of the accused. The name of their organization was "The Cuban Democratic Legión." It counted on the support of such former Batista military officers in the region of Pinar del Río as Juan Cruz Padrón and his brothers. Local peasants in the region were responsible for reporting these subversive activities to regional authorities, who promptly arrested Young, Lambton and a total of eight guerrilla recruits. At the trial, Young and Lambton were found guilty of conspiring under the cover of the CIA to topple the Cuban revolutionary government and sentenced to thirty years in prison, although they were later released into United States custody following negotiations over the failed CIA-directed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Other Cuban conspirators received sentences of between 3 and 25 years.</p>

In frames 28 and 29 of the third row from the top, the union of barbers and manicurists demands a military takeover of the administration of the establishments where they work. Frame 13 of the fourth row and frame 12 show marchers holding a banner that demands "adiestramiento military de la clase obrera" in general; the banner is signed "Delegación de los Panaderos de Marianao." Frames 14 and 15 of the same row show a workers' militia. Frames 30-31 of the third row and frames 33-37 of the bottom row show women dressed in identical dresses matched to the color stripes of the Cuban flag; behind them a banner reads "Comité Ejecutivo FNOEC." The women appear to be singing. In front of them, clearly visible in frame 31, is a mulatta woman dressed entirely like the Cuban flag with a French liberator's cap on her head; from her wrists hang broken chains that are symbolic of Cuba's liberation from slavery.

                        <p>Various images taken at a workers' parade held in Havana's Civic Plaza (later called the Plaza de la Revolución) celebrating labor unions, peasants, militias and the Revolutionary Armed Forces' unconditional support for the government. Among the marchers, a number of labor union members hold banners asking for the Cuban military to take over and manage their centers of employment. In this print, frame 13 of the second row shows a banner reading "Queremos adiestramiento para defender revolución. FNOEC." Frames 14 and 15 show workers holding another banner that reads "Pedimos adiestramiento militar para obreros. Remington Rand." Frame 6 of the last row shows port workers of the Puerto de Mariel carrying a banner that features the painted image of an octopus and frame 8 of the top row documents the participation of stevedores.

                        <p>Top images show Fidel Castro delivering a nighttime address. Behind him, to his left, stands Crescencio Pérez, a peasant made famous for having first helped Fidel and his surviving group of guerrillas after their fateful landing of the Granma on the southern shore of Oriente in December, 1956. Pérez's long line of formal and informal kin relations proved invaluable to the stabilization and long-term successful legitimization of Fidel's guerrillas among the highland populations of the Sierra Maestra. After the war, Fidel awarded Pérez with a commission in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. Succeeding images depict President Osvaldo Dorticós delivering a televised speech to the nation from his office at the Presidential Palace; Minister of Foreign Relations Raúl Roa sits to his left and a bust of José Martí is behind him.

                        <p>Top three rows show the toll booths at the entrance to the national highway heading east out of Havana, today known as Vía Blanca. No one appears to be manning the toll booths and someone has placed a sign on one of them that reads: "FIDEL NUESTRA HAMBRE ES DE 4 MESES." The second to last row of images relates to those in Prints 20 and 21: they show men standing in line outside of what might be a store or food distribution center; frame 13 of this row shows a man with a hook in his left hand that descends from a pipe above. He appears to be weighing something. Bottom row of pictures shows a fashion show taking place in the patio of a large hotel, possibly the Havana Hilton. The models are using the countertop of the bar as a catwalk. See also Prints 19, 20 and 21.</p>

                        <p>Images of Fidel Castro's visit to a state-owned farming cooperative in the Sierra Maestra of Oriente province organized by INRA, the Instituto de Reforma Agraria. Founded in May of 1959, INRA confiscated lands belonging to former members of the dictator Fulgencio Batista's corrupt government or brutal intelligence forces through much of 1960. During this time, INRA came under Fidel Castro's leadership, the most powerful institution in the country, exercising greater authority than even the executive or the cabinet ministers. In Print 23, a "Tienda del Pueblo" is seen in the background. Tiendas del Pueblo were government-owned and subsidized dry goods stores that supplied peasants on cooperatives with cheap basic goods and foods; in many cases, they replaced company stores where peasants had previously redeemed coupons they received for their labor rather than cash and purchased goods from their employers at greatly inflated prices. Prints 23, 24, and 25 show Fidel Castro's party on their expedition as they relax in a tight group on the ground. Frames 7-11 of Print 22 show René Vallejo, director of Agrarian Reform for INRA in Oriente Province. Frames 13-15 of Print 25 and frames 33-36 of Print 23 show an unidentified former guerrilla veteran of Fidel Castro's column in the Sierra Maestra, whom St. George photographed repeatedly during the war, sitting to Fidel's left-hand side.</p>

                           <p>In mid-October, Havana became the site of the U.S.-based American Society of Travel Agents' [ASTA] annual convention. Proposed by ASTA months earlier and accepted enthusiastically by the Cuban government, the convention took place at an extremely tense time in Cuba following the resignation of Commander Huber Matos, military governor of Camagüey, from his post, and Fidel Castro's subsequent decision to arrest him, most of his unit and many others on charges of treason. The convention began, however, on a very optimistic note as Raúl Castro, Minister of the Armed Forces, President Osvaldo Dorticós, the First Lady, Air Force Chief Juan Almeida Bosque, Miss Brasilia and others prepared to receive delegates at the Havana Hilton. This print documents the arrival of Raúl Castro and Dorticós' party to convention headquarters. In Prints 11 and 12, President Dorticós is seen wearing a badge that reads (in English): "Ask me, I live here" and the First Lady is seen wearing a similar badge, reading "INFORMATION." In Print 29, it is clear that Raúl Castro bears the same badge as Dorticós on his chest. See also Prints 27, 28, 34, 41, 45, 51, 65, 73 and 74.</p>

                           <p>Top row of prints depicts Raúl Castro greeting delegates to the ASTA convention and offering them tiny cups of Cuban espresso at convention headquarters in the Havana Hilton. The second row of prints shows Fidel Castro addressing participants in the ASTA convention on the morning of October 19. Behind him are the United States, Cuban and ASTA flags; behind him is a banner reading "American Society of Travel Agents." Rows 4 and 5 show Fidel Castro later that evening as he addresses a national televised audience on "Ante la Prensa" and denounces Commander Huber Matos for having resigned his post in protest of what Matos alleged was increasing evidence of Communist influence. In this speech, Castro condemns Matos for resigning as a traitor and asserts that his resignation would have served as a prelude to an armed conspiracy. Frames 13-15 of the fourth row show Raúl Castro with Che Guevara at his side sitting in the studio audience. Frames 16 and 17 show Fidel Castro and Antonio Nuñez Jiménez. The last row of photos shows images taken of the mass demonstration before the Presidential Palace organized by state-affiliated labor unions in support of Castro's arrest of Matos and decision to reopen the Revolutionary Tribunals on October 26, 1959. For related images of the ASTA convention, see Prints 26, 28, 34, 41, 45, 51, 65, 73 and 74. For images of Fidel Castro denouncing Matos on television, see Prints 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42 and 60.

Matos was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. The rally was also called in order to show popular support for the recommissioning of Revolutionary Tribunals to try internal enemies of Cuba for counterrevolution and to protest recent incursions into Cuban airspace by Florida-based planes that had been carrying out bombing, leafletting and other violent raids on Cuba in order to topple the government.

                        <p>Bottom two rows of frames show United States Embassy staff inside and outside the Embassy in Havana; frames 17-19 show United States Ambassador Philip W. Bonsal in his chauffeur-driven car with another official. Frames 15-19 show a woman and small boy looking up at a sign protesting United States complicity with acts of aggression carried out by planes based in Florida and directed by former batistianos and their allies in Miami. The sign reads (in grammatically poor English): "Till when will USA permit the bomber to Cuba?" In the background of the photograph stands the United States Embassy. Very bottom close-up images of Fidel Castro were taken as he gave a televised address to the nation and denounced Commander Huber Matos of treason and counterrevolutionary conspiracy for the first time following the latter's voluntary resignation of his post on October 19, 1959.

                        <p>Images of Fidel Castro addressing a mass rally of Cubans whom he called out on October 26, 1959, to express support for his decision to arrest Commander Huber Matos for resigning his military post and to charge him with treason and attempting to conspire against the revolutionary government. Matos was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. The rally was also called in order to show popular support for the recommissioning of Revolutionary Tribunals to try internal enemies of Cuba for counterrevolution and to protest recent incursions into Cuban airspace by Florida-based planes that had been carrying out bombing, leafletting and other violent raids on Cuba in order to topple the government in those days. All speakers addressed the crowd from the balcony of the Presidential Palace. Frames in the second row from the top of this print show Raúl Castro also addressing the crowds.

                        <p>These images were taken on different occasions and depict separate events. The top row of images shows Fidel Castro delivering an address to a gathered crowd, largely composed of labor union members affiliated with the government, at the Presidential Palace on October 26, 1959. The third row of images shows Fidel Castro gesticulating while giving a televised speech at which he alleged the treason of Commander Huber Matos on the show "Ante la Prensa." The last row of images shows protestors stopping cars on the Malecón during the ASTA Convention to alert them to the fact that on the 20th of October, a flight originating from Florida had dropped leaflets over Havana and had, or so it was believed at the time, attempted to "bomb" the city, although it is unclear whether damage caused resulted from the aircraft itself or from shrapnel caused by anti-aircraft fire from the ground and the air that greeted it. Former Revolutionary Air Force chief Pedro Díaz Lanz who had defected to Miami in June and joined his former batistiano enemies in charging Fidel Castro with turning the Revolution "communist" was later found to have piloted the plane. The sign on the car in frame 10 of the last row reads "Partieron de Estados Unidos los Aviones" (The planes left from the United States"). For related images of the ASTA convention, see Prints 26, 28, 34, 41, 45, 51, 65, 73 and 74. For images of Fidel Castro denouncing Matos on television, see Prints 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 42, 60 and 65. For images of the October 25th mass rally, see Prints 34, 41 43, 44, 46, 52, 47, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 66 and 70. For other images of the bombing protests, see Prints 63, 68, 69 and 71.</p>

This print shows the enormity of the crowds and, from a distance, the large banners many were carrying. To the right of many of the frames, especially 6, 7, 32, 27 and 28, one can see the remaining ruin of the old wall of the city of Havana with a sign on it that shows Fidel Castro's face painted in profile next to those of José Martí and Antonio Maceo, nineteenth-century independence heroes and martyrs. Frames 2-3 document the positioning of rifle-bearing sharpshooters on the roof of the Presidential Palace, keeping watch over the crowd and speakers.

                        <p>Bottom three rows show U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Philip W. Bonsal, holding a press conference and answering questions for the Cuban and foreign press in his office at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. At the time, Bonsal was countering Cuban government charges that the United States was aware of and complicit in the campaign of air raids from bases in Florida that batistianos and other exiles had begun launching against Cuba on October 20th of that year. Top two rows depict a national folkloric dance show held in the Plaza of the Cathedral of Old Havana in the front courtyard of an eighteenth-century mansion that had been converted into a restaurant known as La Casona.

                           <p>Scenes of speakers and invited officials gathered on the balcony of the Presidential Palace for a mass rally called by Fidel Castro on October 26, 1959, and organized by government-affiliated labor unions to express support for Fidel Castro's decision to arrest Commander Huber Matos for resigning his military post and to charge him with treason and attempting to conspire against the revolutionary government.

The rally was also called in order to show popular support for the recommissioning of Revolutionary Tribunals to try internal enemies of Cuba for counterrevolution and to protest recent air raids by counterrevolutionary exile groups, largely comprised of batistianos, based in Florida. Frames 13-15 show Fidel Castro addressing the crowds; frames 18-23 show Fidel (wearing glasses) as he makes his way to the podium. Frames 27-29 and 30 show Carlos Prío de Socarrás, the last democratically-elected President of Cuba, who was overthrown by Fulgencio Batista's coup on March 10, 1952. Prío de Socarrás had been the leader of the Auténtico Party but returned to Cuba at the time after a three-month tour of Europe and expressed only support for Fidel Castro and his recent decisions. During Castro's speech at the rally that day, he made sure to point out Prío de Socarrás' presence on several occasions; it is possible that St. George took these photos just as Fidel was mentioning him to the crowd. Frames 4 and 5 depict a uniformed man wearing a badge on his shirtsleeve that reads "Milicia Obrera." See also Prints 35, 36, 37, 38, 43, 44, 47, 46, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 70.</p>

                           <p>Images taken from the balcony of the Presidential Palace at a mass rally called by Fidel Castro on October 26, 1959, and organized by government-affiliated labor unions to express support for Fidel Castro's decision to arrest Commander Huber Matos for resigning his military post and to charge him with treason and attempting to conspire against the revolutionary government. Matos was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. The rally was also called in order to show popular support for the recommissioning of Revolutionary Tribunals to try internal enemies of Cuba for counterrevolution and to protest recent air raids by counterrevolutionary exile groups, largely comprised of batistianos, based in Florida.

                        <p>Various images of street protests in response to the flight of Pedro Díaz Lanz, the former chief of Cuba's Revolutionary Air Force, who had defected to Miami in June of 1959, and had carried out a leafletting campaign in the early morning hours of October 20, 1959. The plane was found to have originated from Florida, to which it returned after receiving anti-aircraft fire from the ground in Cuba. Because of minor damage inflicted either by the plane's alleged dropping of a bomb or by shrapnel released when it engaged Cuban jets and defensive fire from the ground, the Cuban government declared the air raid "Havana's Pearl Harbor" and mobilized thousands of protestors against what it indirectly declared an act of indirect United States aggression toward Cuba carried out by batistiano loyalists with ties to the CIA based in Miami. In frame 17 of the second row, protestors hold signs reading "Pedimos devolución de traidores y asesinos," a reference to the United States' willingness to harbor former members of the Batista regime whom protestors wanted tried for war crimes in Cuba. Another protestor in the same frame holds a sign reading "No más bombardeo a cuidades" and a third sign reads "Paredón para los traidores." Frame 13 of the third row shows a man holding a copy of the 26th of July Movement's official newspaper, Revolución, whose headline reads "Fidel aquí estamos." Frame 15 of the same row shows men sitting on the flatbed of a truck; sticking out of the window of the truck is a painted wooden machete that reads "Obreros de Mazorra presente," or "The Workers of Mazorra are Present." Mazorra is Havana's asylum for the mentally insane that became infamous for its inhumane and brutal treatment of patients when the free press investigated conditions after the fall of Batista in January 1959. The rehabilitation and transformation of Mazorra into a premier asylum was considered one of the first great feats of the Revolution in Cuba. See also Prints 35, 45, 63, 68, 69 and 71.</p>

                        <p>Images documenting curious Cuban on-lookers and police as they inspect damage done to a window, probably by a counterrevolutionary saboteur, who appears to have thrown a brick or other projectile through the glass. These images were most likely taken in mid-to-late October 1959 when Havana experienced the first consistent wave of counterrevolutionary violence following the resignation from his military command and subsequent arrest of Commander Huber Matos.

                        <p>Images of protestors blocking traffic on Calle Línea in el Vedado (frames 28-30, 31-33, 35-36) and the Malecón of Havana (frames 19-24, 16-18, 25-27) in response to the Cuban government's announcement that Pedro Díaz Lanz, the head of Cuba's revolutionary Air Force who had defected to Miami in June of 1959, had carried out a leafletting air raid over Havana and that subsequent encounters with Cuban jets resulted in damage to buildings below, allegedly by bombs dropped from his plane. Díaz Lanz eventually landed again at a base in Florida. The Cuban government called this incursion on their airspace for terroristic purposes, "Havana's Pearl Harbor." Frames 4-9 show a private car with a sign on the windshield that reads "Partieron de Estados Unidos los aviones." The air raid took place on October 20, the same day that Commander Huber Matos was arrested for treason, so these pictures were probably later that same day or the following day.

                        <p>Images taken from the balcony of the Presidential Palace as Fidel Castro addresses a mass rally on October 26, 1959, that was organized by government-affiliated labor unions to express support for Fidel Castro's decision to arrest Commander Huber Matos for resigning his military post and to charge him with treason and attempting to conspire against the revolutionary government. Matos was later sentenced to twenty years in prison. The rally was also called in order to show popular support for the recommissioning of Revolutionary Tribunals to try internal enemies of Cuba for counterrevolution and to protest recent air raids by counterrevolutionary exile groups, largely comprised of batistianos, based in Florida.

This rally was held before the Presidential Palace in the evening and night of October 26, 1959. Bottom rows of images show a woman and small boy looking up at a sign protesting United States complicity with acts of aggression carried out by planes based in Florida and directed by former batistianos and their allies in Miami. The sign reads (in grammatically poor English): "Till when will USA permit the bomber to Cuba?" In the background of the photograph stands the United States Embassy.

It took another several hours for the government to confirm that this news was false. Neither Camilo Cienfuegos' body, that of his co-pilot nor any plane wreckage was ever found.

                        <p>Contains two full sheets of prints. Images of children during morning assembly at the newly constructed school at Camp Columbia, the famous military base originally founded by the U.S. military during the first U.S. occupation of Cuba (1898-1902). Camp Columbia had been the site of the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Fulgencio Batista, against army superiors. This action, taken in favor of the revolutionary movement against the dictator Machado, made Batista an instant national hero until his rupture with Cuba's short-lived revolutionary government in 1933. Thereafter and until 1959, Camp Columbia had been the principal military operations and intelligence depot for the dictator Fulgencio Batista's national army. For this reason, Fidel Castro chose the base as the site from which to make his first speech of triumph to the nation upon his troops' arrival in Havana on the night of January 8, 1959. Camp Columbia was renamed Ciudad Libertad after the founding of the school and it became the first of many army barracks and bases that the government re-crafted as schools in the next several years. Ironically, as the images show, the system of education and cultural values instilled by school programs (such as daily assembly) was highly militarized. See also Prints 6, 9, 32, 33, 34, and 36.</p>

                        <p>The opening session of the first literary conference organized by the revolutionary government. Present are Vilma Espín, Raúl Castro's wife and president of the soon-to-be founded Federación de Mujeres Cubanas. Seated in the audience is Nicolás Guillén, Cuba's future poet laureate and a longtime member of the Communist Party (known as the Partido Socialista Popular from the 1930s through the early 1960s). Speakers include Miguel Angel Asturias, the Guatemalan writer who would win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1967, as well as Pablo Neruda, the great Chilean poet, also a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1971. The conference was organized, in part, by Carlos Franqui and other contributing editors of Lunes, a literary and cultural supplement to the official state newspaper, Revolución. Lunes was later eliminated in 1961 for taking positions on the role and nature of cultural freedoms contrary to those espoused by government leaders, especially Fidel Castro.

                        <p>Contains three sheets. Images of children on the playground at the newly constructed school, "Ciudad Libertad," on the former military base of Camp Columbia, Havana. Camp Columbia had been the site of the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Fulgencio Batista, against army superiors. This action, taken in favor of the revolutionary movement against the dictator Machado, made Batista an instant national hero until his rupture with Cuba's short-lived revolutionary government in 1933. Thereafter and until 1959, Camp Columbia had been the principal military operations and intelligence depot for the dictator Fulgencio Batista's national army. Consequently, the transformation of Camp Columbia into a place for the educational uplift of peasants acquired particular symbolic value after the Revolution. Ironically, as the images show, the system of education and cultural values instilled by school programs (such as daily assembly) were highly militarized.

                        <p>Scenes from the first conference on Latin American literature organized by sectors of Cuba's revolutionary government. Present are Vilma Espín, Raúl Castro's wife and president of the soon-to-be founded Federación de Mujeres Cubanas. Speakers include Miguel Angel Asturias, the Guatemalan writer who would win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1967, as well as Pablo Neruda, the great Chilean poet, also a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1971. The conference was organized, in part, by Carlos Franqui and other contributing editors of Lunes, a literary and cultural supplement to the official state newspaper, Revolución. Lunes was later eliminated in 1961 for taking positions on the role and nature of cultural freedoms contrary to those espoused by government leaders, especially Fidel Castro.

                        <p>Scenes from sessions of the first conference on Latin American literature organized by sectors of the revolutionary government. Present are Vilma Espín, Raúl Castro's wife and president of the soon-to-be founded Federación de Mujeres Cubanas, and Nicolás Guillén, Cuba's future poet laureate and a longtime member of the Communist Party (known as the Partido Socialista Popular from the 1930s through the early 1960s). Speakers include Miguel Angel Asturias, the Guatemalan writer who would win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1967, as well as Pablo Neruda, the great Chilean poet, also a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature for 1971. The conference was organized, in part, by Carlos Franqui and other contributing editors of Lunes, a literary and cultural supplement to the official state newspaper, Revolución. Lunes was later eliminated in 1961 for taking positions on the role and nature of cultural freedoms contrary to those espoused by government leaders, especially Fidel Castro. This sheet features closeup shots of various impassioned writers as they address the audience. The top three rows show an unidentified older woman speaking with another woman, possibly a translator at her side. See also Prints 15, 24, 28, 43-52 and 55.</p>

The plane is empty of all passengers except for the Minoffs and photographer. It is likely that the fishing trip took place near the Ciénaga de Zapata, a mangrove-lined swamp famous for its fishing and crocodiles in south-central Cuba. Frames 3-6 of the second sheet show Marvin Minoff holding a rifle off the edge of a boat and shooting at something, most likely a crocodile.

Camp Columbia had been the principal military operations and intelligence depot for the dictator Fulgencio Batista's national army. For this reason, Fidel Castro chose the base as the site from which to make his first speech of triumph to the nation upon his troops' arrival in Havana on the night of January 8, 1959. Camp Columbia was renamed Ciudad Libertad after the founding of the school and it became the first of many army barracks and bases that the government re-crafted as schools in the next several years.

                        <p>Contains three sheets. These prints depict a large multistory building complex, part of which appears to be under construction. Included in the images are several frames showing the display of artillery batteries used by the United States military. They were probably used when the United States intervened in Cuba's last war for independence against Spain (1895-1898), often characterized by United States historians as the "Spanish-American War." The artillery batteries are located in a park, possibly adjacent to the building complex. Also evident is St. George's documentation of one of the first signs to appear in Cuba that used quotations from the works of the nineteenth-century nationalist José Martí as part of a state campaign to politicize the landscape with billboards. Quotations like this one soon became standard fare, although they were still a novelty in 1960. This one reads, "Toda la vida es deber. -José Martí (All of life is a duty.-José Martí)." In the left-hand corner of the sign is the word "Municipio," that is, confirmation that it was made by a government agency. This again would become the order of the day in 1960 as all nongovernment publicity or self-expression through public signs would become impermissible.</p>

                        <p>The bottom three rows feature images of a daytime Carnival parade near the Malecón in Old Havana; the top row (frames 8-11) shows a helicopter carrying Soviet Vice Premier Anastas Mikoyan as it prepares to land at a pad on the end of the Malecón, facing El Morro fortress in Old Havana. Crowds gather on the ground to watch the parade move toward the helicopter and photographer St. George is seen crossing the street toward Mikoyan's helicopter with an unidentified woman at his side (frames 3-6 of the fourth row). The monument in the background of these images of St. George is a memorial to the eight medical students executed by Spain on November 27, 1871. These photographs of St. George were probably taken by Jay Mallin, a fellow free-lance photographer who accompanied St. George on various assignments in Cuba from 1959-1960.

                        <p>The initial moments of Soviet Premier Anastas Mikoyan's arrival in Havana in early February 1960. Frames 6-7 show Fidel Castro with Antonio Nuñez Jiménez, the first director of INRA (Instituto Nacional de Reformia Agraria) at his side; frames 8-9 show Ernesto "Che" Guevara and unidentified others standing beside the Soviets' official jet. Frames 10-20 show Ernesto "Che" Guevara looking expectantly at the aircraft while standing inside the airport terminal (it has apparently begun to rain). Che is surrounded by a large group of men in civilian dress, including a tall blond man with glasses (see also Prints 71, 79 [frames 27-35], 80, 83, 92, 93, 101, 102, and 106 [frames 19, 20]), as well as other military officers. Frames 21 and 22 show the Cubans huddled under the awnings of the airport terminal to escape the rain, waving enthusiastically as apparently Mikoyan descends from the plane (see also Print 65).

                        <p>The second and bottom row of frames provides images taken in the early part of the day, February 5, 1960, when Anastas Mikoyan gave a speech and deposited a Soviet-styled floral offering at the statue of José Martí in Havana's Central Park. This event was succeeded by Mikoyan's inauguration of the Soviet Expo at the Museo de Bellas Artes. There he was joined by Fidel Castro (frames 23-24 in the first row and frames 25-26 in the third row), as well as President Osvaldo Dorticós, and the First Lady. Frames 20-21 show his motorcade upon arrival at the site and frame 22 shows a large contingent of military officers of the Cuban army, including Juan Almeida Bosque, walking toward the ceremony or to greet Mikoyan.

Remaining images show rural workers dressed in shabby clothes as they consume a meal at long, cafeteria-style wooden tables.</p>

                        <p>The cooperative "Camilo Cienfuegos," taken at Christmas 1959, shortly after the government announced its decision to cancel payment of traditional Christmas bonuses to sugar workers. Instead, the government offered to sponsor collective Christmas dinners for workers in plantation cafeterias by providing four million dollars in credits for financing. St. George's film submission note, enclosed in this folder, confirms the circumstances of these images. Taken from the backseat of a government jeep, the top row of frames shows an INRA official sitting low in the seat while speaking to an agitated peasant. The driver relaxes his arm along the back of the seat. According to St. George's note, these frames show a "typical" encounter in which a local peasant approaches the jeep and complains directly to the official about conditions on the cooperative with the expectation that his problems might be solved in the "personalistic" fashion reminiscent of the days when peasants similarly complained to the patron (capitalist owner of the plantation).</p>

                        <p>Parade and mass rally held on International Labor Day, May 1st, 1960, in what was then still called La Plaza Cívica, later renamed La Plaza de la Revolución. Parades of popular militias, first organized six months earlier by the government, were a feature of the day along with an hours-long speech by Fidel Castro that began in the late afternoon, continued through dusk and ended after sunset. Based on images of comparably large demonstrations produced by St. George and other photographers of the period, the crowd pictured in this series numbered in the hundreds of thousands of people. Prints are not ordered chronologically and the themes or events treated are dispersed. See also Prints 59 and 65.</p>

                           <p>Top frames of this print show President Osvaldo Dorticós, Prime Minister Fidel Castro and an unidentified Cuban official also dressed in army fatigues as they observe the May Day parade of military and popular militias before the national monument to José Martí at whose base they stand. Like these officials, a woman from the crowd is shown wearing the signature "guajiro" or traditional Cuban peasant hat that became a trademark of the early years of the Revolution and was widely distributed for mass rallies. In the second set of frames, the popular peasant militia is pictured in uniforms that include this hat while another militia, possibly a workers' brigade, is shown parading in black or dark-colored boinas, or berets. Final frames show Fidel Castro at a later point in the day, around dusk, when he delivered an address to the assembly. In the two last frames of the print, a white dove is shown perched on the podium, to the left of Fidel. The use of white doves to inaugurate Fidel's speeches became common after the spectacularly positive effect that the release of several trained white doves had on the Cuban people at Fidel's first victorious address to the Cuban people at Camp Columbia on January 8, 1959.

                           <p>Images of the military and civic parade that launched the May Day celebration and rally in the Plaza Cívica of Havana, held on May 1, 1960. Top frames show two more images of the same woman from the crowd who wears a guajiro, or traditional Cuban peasant hat, as well as Juan Almeida Bosque, then commander of the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force, and two unidentified bearded officials sitting on his right and left. In the second set of frames, Cuba's famed poet and longtime Communist Party member Nicolás Guillén is pictured holding a Cuban flag while he and others watch the parade from the platform at the foot of the national monument to José Martí. Images of the crowd in the same set of frames show a banner held by members of the national gastronomic workers' union. Other images depict the marches of a government-organized all-male militia, as well as soldiers of Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces. Bottom frames show the recently organized women's popular militias.</p>

                        <p>Photographs documenting the successful operation of Commander William Morgan's state-owned frog farm in Pinar del Río province, Cuba, probably taken in the spring (May or June) of 1960. Morgan, a U.S. citizen, served in the 26th of July Movement's Second Front in Santa Clara province during the war against Batista, eventually commanding a column of forces and acquiring the highest post in the guerrilla army. After the triumph of revolutionary forces in January 1959, Morgan became best known for rooting out a counterrevolutionary conspiracy of batistianos that the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, funded from abroad in August 1959. Having been declared a national hero by Fidel Castro himself, Morgan opted to withdraw from an active position with the Revolutionary Armed Forces in order to open an experimental frog-raising farm on lands recently transferred to the state from the former batistiano elite by INRA, the Instituto de Reforma Agraria. With the goal of eventually producing fresh frog legs for export, Morgan directed the design of the farm, oversaw production activities, as well as its Cuban workforce, until March of 1961. At that time, he was accused of using the farm's vehicles to ship weapons and food to a counterrevolutionary peasant movement in Santa Clara's Esambray mountains that emerged to contest Fidel Castro's rule and turn toward state communism. Shortly afterward, Morgan was convicted by the revolutionary government of treason and executed by firing squad.</p>

                        <p>Inaugural session of the 10th Congress of the Confederación de Trabajadores Cubanos [CTC], Cuba's largest umbrella syndicate of labor unions, held November 18, 1959, in Havana. The congress was considered the first "liberated" meeting of the CTC because Batista's political allies, such as Eusebio Mujal, who had formerly controlled its elections and decisions through corruption and intimidation, were no longer present. Although the congress was supposed to begin in the early afternoon, it did not start until 10:30 PM when Fidel Castro finally arrived to give the opening address. In the background of the stage, there are two signs posted, which read "Trabjadores: De tu peso depende la liberación económica de la CTC" and another one simply saying "4%." These signs reference two government-initiated campaigns for worker donations to the industrialization of the country and the purchasing of arms for its defense against U.S.-based incursions that had garnered the support of CTC leaders aligned with Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement. The highest ranking of these leaders, David Salvador (with beard), is seen sitting at the front table on stage, one man down from the right of Che Guevara (with beret). At the far end of the front table is President Osvaldo Dorticós (in glasses). Others in attendance include Augusto Martínez Sánchez, the Minister of Labor. See also Print 37.</p>

                        <p>Session of the 1st Congress of the Confederación de Trabajadores Cubanos [CTC], Cuba's largest umbrella syndicate of labor unions, held between November 18 and 25, 1959, in Havana. Approximately 3,000 workers' delegates attended the congress whose primary task was the election of a new governing board, free of the mujalistas, or allies of Eusebio Mujal, Batista's main representative who had previously controlled the unions. Fidel's inaugural address to the delegates is clearly documented in Print 30. These images appear to document Fidel Castro's subsequent address to the workers' delegates that occurred after a great deal of strife erupted over the election of a slate of candidates to the governing board that included former members of the mujalista-Batista alliance who were active Communists. Conflict culminated on the 23rd of November, one of the final days of the congress. Fidel returned to the congress in order to urge that the "unity" slate of candidates, including the Communists, as well as David Salvador, the candidate his government backed for the position of Secretary General, be elected. On stage, directly behind Fidel, sit a number of delegates clearly allied to the 26th of July Movement, as is clear from their use of the revolutionary militiamen's uniforms. Fidel Castro's speech to the delegates was also being televised, as is clear from the top three rows of frames. See also Print 30.</p>

                        <p>Top frames document a student rally on the Escalinata (entrance steps) of the University of Havana. Along the speakers' platform a banner appears with the words "Mes del Recinto" (Month of the Campus). Probably taken in November of 1959 when the university was undergoing the first phase of revolutionary reforms that would initially purge all professors with a history of batistiano allegiance from the campus and eventually end the autonomy of the university from state intervention by the fall of the following year. In frames 7 and 8, it is possible to make out the central figure of Fidel Castro as he addresses the crowd. Bottom frames show images of a car race held at the Ciudad Deportiva, probably taken in February of 1960 when St. George included similar images in a series of photographs taken for<title type="simple" render="italic">

                        <p>Top frames document a student rally on the Escalinata (entrance steps) of the University of Havana. Probably taken in November of 1959 when the university was undergoing the first phase of revolutionary reforms that would initially purge all professors with a history of batistiano allegiance from the campus and eventually end the autonomy of the university from state intervention by the fall of the following year. Fidel Castro was the featured speaker. Bottom frames show visiting French intellectuals Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre as they greet Cubans poolside at the Hotel Nacional, March 1960. See also Prints 31, 36, 38 for the student rally; for images of the Sartre and de Beauvoir visit, see also Prints 43, 44 and 47.</p>

                        <p>Images taken of several businesses in Havana's Barrio Chino, or Chinese quarter, probably in early 1960. Top frames show street peddlers selling books and oranges on la Calle Zanja, or Zanja street. The second and third sets of frames show a typographers' workshop and a Chinese herb and medicine shop. The fourth set of frames shows the offices of unidentified business in which three Cubans, one Chinese, one creole white and one mulatto, as well as a young creole white office boy, attend to a visiting foreigner, possibly Jay Mallin, a reporter who often accompanied the photographer.</p>

Celia Sánchez appears in a printed blouse and white button earrings in several frames, alongside Fidel Castro and other unidentified bearded bodyguard (with his back to the camera) who appears in Print 60. Print also includes a set of nighttime pictures taken along the mall of El Prado. See also Prints 60 and 64.</p>

                        <p>Top frames show Fidel Castro, his son, Fidel Castro Díaz Balart, (in white T-shirt) and an unidentified boy with Celia Sánchez at her home in el Vedado. Images depict three fatigue-dressed bodyguards sitting on a couch, as well as a white-haired man in a business suit whose back is to the camera. There are two images taken from the balcony that show a boy and then a woman who are attempting to photograph the boys as they play with a radio on the balcony of the house. Middle and bottom frames show part of El Prado in downtown Havana, as well as a sign painted on a wall that has been hand-mounted in a park. The sign reads "¡Viva el primer aniversario de la Revolución Cubana! Partido Socialista Popular (Long live the first anniversary of the Cuban Revolution! Popular Socialist Party)." Bottom frames show a Cuban-Chinese taxi driver standing by his car in front of the headquarters of the Alianza Nueva Democracia China. See also Prints 58 and 64.</p>

                        <p>Top frames show part of a banner hanging from the balcony of a building that demands an end to U.S. aggression against Cuba, in particular, the ending of all bombings and air raids. At the time, it was increasingly common for small, unidentified aircraft to run sabotage and bombing raids from bases in Florida into Cuban territory. Beginning in the late fall of 1959, targeted sites included sugar mills and other facilities within the province of Havana. The second set of frames shows betters lined up at the race track in Havana's Casino Deportivo. The last three rows of frames depict foreign tourists gambling at a casino, probably located in the Hotel Nacional. See also Prints 51, 52, 53, 55, 56 and 61.</p>

                        <p>Images of a televised panel of women leaders. Photographs center on Vilma Espín, leader of the underground resistance in Oriente after the 1957 assassination of Frank País during the anti-Batista war, wife of Raúl Castro and future founder of the Federación de Mujeres Cubanas, a mass organization introduced in 1961. Hidden outside the frame of the camera is Loló de la Torriente, a longtime feminist and respective journalist active since the 1920s whose name plate appears on the table next to E. Lina Milanés, a gray-haired woman sitting to the immediate right of Vilma Espín. The woman to the left of Vilma Espín remains unidentified. See also Prints 66 and 81.</p>

                        <p>Congress of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores del Azucar [FNTA], representing 234 sugar workers' unions, held in Havana in mid-December 1959. In attendance at the front table on stage are Conrado Becquer, the head of the FNTA (smoking a cigar), Prime Minister Fidel Castro and President Osvaldo Dorticós. David Salvador, President of the CTC, the FNTA's umbrella union, is pictured giving a speech. Although affiliated to the 26th of July Movement from the beginning of the Revolution, Salvador eventually resigned from the directorship of the union in April of 1960 and was subsequently convicted of counterrevolutionary activities for which he received a twenty-year prison sentence.

                        <p>Fidel Castro addresses delegates and the media at the Congress of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores del Azucar [FNTA], representing 234 sugar workers' unions, held in Havana in mid-December 1959. Other frames show a militiaman (wearing a beret) in the act of frisking and searching an unidentified man while another man pointing a pistol looks on. These events seem to have taken place in a bathroom, possibly in a private residence where Fidel Castro was at the time (such as that of Celia Sánchez, pictured in Prints 58, 60, and 64).

The last two sets of frames show a panel of leading women activists of the period, apparently speaking for a television broadcast. Frames 28 and 29 show from left to right, Loló de la Torriente, Vilma Espín, E. Lina Milanés and an unidentified older woman with white hair and glasses. For images of the unidentified foreigner and his Cuban counterparts see also Prints 39, 79, 82, and 86. For other images of the female panelists, see Prints 66 and 67.</p>

                        <p>Public gathering before a stage where Fidel is one of the speakers. This event appears to have been held on the far-end of the Malecón, or the sea wall skirting the entrance to the Bay of Havana. It was one of many public rallies held to celebrate the Cuban government's campaign to nationalize increasing numbers of U.S.-owned businesses following conflict over Cuba's decision to accept the Soviet Union's offer to sell unrefined oil to Cuba at much reduced prices in May of 1960. The resulting confrontation with the U.S. government led to the nationalization of U.S. oil refineries in Cuba and sparked the process of general nationalization and confiscation which this rally celebrates.

                        <p>Public protest on the Malecón (Sea Wall) of Havana at which a bonfire is made of a tall wooden effigy representing the Cuban Republic. Small images depict corrupt politicians, the cultural decadence of the period and a black coffin with the face of a skeleton refers to cycles of state terror and violence against Cuban citizens. The effigy is being shown as it is torched and later as it burns before a sizeable crowd of thousands. This rally was one of many public demonstrations held in the summer and fall of 1960 in order to celebrate the Cuban government's decision to nationalize U.S.-owned businesses and properties in Cuba.

                        <p>Images of an unidentified man examining a newspaper on a podium-style desk with a large salon in the background. This salon, staffed by a large number of writers sitting at desks with typewriters, appears to show a large newspaper office, for its size, possibly Diario de la Marina, which was housed in a large building on Prado, directly facing the Capitolio. This was the first national newspaper to be occupied by militias loyal to the government and nationalized for supporting counterrevolutionary activities in May of 1960.

                        <p>View from catwalk of television studio of the show "Ante la Prensa," Cuba's version of "Meet the Press," on which government officials, especially Fidel Castro, made regular appearances. On this occasion, the main official being interviewed is Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, a member of the historic Communist Party in Cuba, called until 1961, the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP) and important journalist in Cienfuegos, Cuba. Rodríguez was appointed to join Prime Minister Fidel Castro's governing cabinet and as the radicalization of the Revolution proceeded in 1960, was increasingly given a much higher-profile role, despite his long-time affiliation with the PSP. Such an affiliation, prior to 1960, was considered a liability for the Castro-led government. See also Prints 7 and 9.</p>

                        <p>Bottom frames of the sheet show Raúl Castro, the Chief of Cuba's Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias from October 1959 to the present, giving a speech on national television. Top half of the images show members of the Unidad Femenina Revolucionaria training at the parade grounds of El Morro Fortress, as well as another group of women dressed in civilian clothes being taught how to march by officers of the Fuerzas Armadas. These first militias were trained and organized in November and December, 1959. The pictures are probably taken early in the winter of 1960 when the photographer visited Cuba for a lengthy stay. Also present is a reporter from California where shots of the same uniformed women subsequently appeared in newspapers owned by C.K. McClatchy, the Sacramento Bee, the Modesto Bee and the Fresno Bee.

                        <p>Images of the national congress of the Confederación de Trabajadores Cubanos [CTC], Cuba's largest labor union, held in November of 1959. Frames in the top four rows and bottom row of the sheet show Fidel Castro sitting at the front table on stage with Efigenio Ameijeiras to his right, Osmani Cienfuegos standing above Fidel and speaking in his ear, and David Salvador, Secretary General of the CTC until April of 1960 when his criticism of policies centralizing state control over unions led to his expulsion, initially on charges of corruption that later changed to accusations of counterrevolution. The man speaking before the microphone is an unidentified labor delegate. Frame 25 of the bottom row shows Violeta Casals, a famous radio-novela actress who lent her voice to the clandestine radio station known as Radio Rebelde during the war against Batista in the late 1950s.

                        <p>Photographs of tourists cavorting at the swimming pool of the Hotel Presidente, located on the Avenida de los Presidentes (also known as "G" Street) in el Vedado, Havana, across the street from what is today Cuba's Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores (MINREX), a banker's former home. Prints 15 and 16 clearly show the monument to Tomás Estrada Palma on the street in front of the pool area of the hotel. Estrada Palma was Cuba's first President, installed in an uncontested election in 1902, held during the first U.S. military occupation of Cuba (1898-1902). This is significant because all monuments to republican-era political figures were desecrated by government order in early 1961. Today, only the pedestal still stands, topped by the statue of Tomás Estrada Palma's bronze shoes, which workers were not able to remove from the base of the pedestal. See also Prints 17 and 35.</p>

                        <p>This folder encloses both a contact sheet and an empty envelope for holding negatives with a typed descriptive text. As confirmed by this text, images in the contact sheet show the aborted attempted landing of a U.S.-based Piper Apache aircraft, flown by Matthew Edward Duke, on a secret mission to Cuba in order to facilitate the escape of four former officials of the Batista regime who were probably facing trial and possible execution in Cuba for war crimes. According to St. George's notes typed on envelope enclosed, the crash took place on May 12, 1960.</p>

                        <p>Frames 10-12 of the second row and images 3-9 of the fourth and fifth rows show an all-female militia called the Unidad Femenina Revolucionaria parading down San Rafael Boulevard in Centro Habana, towards Central Park where a number of citizens are gathered (Frame 12), probably for the commemoration of the anniversary of the death of José Martí on May 19, 1960. All other images show Fidel participating in Ernest Hemingway's famed May 1960 fishing tournament, staged in the Marina Barlovento, now known as the Marina Hemingway in Cuba. Frames 15-19, 20-24 show Fidel Castro on board the fishing vessel, Cristal, returning with his catch. Frames 30-34 show Fidel smiling as his fish are weighed. Later, Fidel would be proclaimed the winner of all the main fishing prizes and trophies given out by Hemingway. See also Prints 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 41, 63 and 64.</p>

Parade seems to have culminated in Central Park, before the statue to José Martí, a traditional site for political protests and parades coinciding with national patriotic celebrations. This parade seems to have been in honor of either the birth of the Republic (Cuban Independence Day), May 20th, or more likely, the anniversary of the death of José Martí, May 19.

                        <p>Images of the Cuban revolutionary government's nationalization of the U.S.-owned oil refinery known as Esso in Cuba (Exxon in the United States), as well as Shell Oil in June 1960. These refineries were located near the Bay of Havana. Their nationalization came as a result of Soviet offers to sell Cuba Russian crude oil at much reduced prices and the U.S. government's refusal to allow its companies to refine the oil. This was the first of all U.S.-owned businesses to be nationalized in the summer of 1960. This process was completed by August and capped off by the imposition of a U.S. embargo against Cuba in October that then prompted the Cubans' subsequent decision to nationalize all properties owned by U.S. citizens, not just businesses. In all, Cuba nationalized hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. businesses and properties. In frames 3-5 of this print, a cloth banner signed by the "Sección Sindical de [unclear]" denounces Yankee imperialism and claims the fatherland ["patria"] for the Cubans.

Row two shows a tiny number of tourists gathered poolside at unidentified hotel. Third row of images shows Havana's Palacio Deportivo, now called Ciudad Deportiva, with newly painted sign reading "Cuba Territorio Libre de América" on its roof. Row four shows a stenciled sign along a wall that celebrates the Cuban government's polices of nationalizing oil refineries and railroad facilities. It reads: "Sin Cuota pero sin AMO. Todos al Palacio Domingo 2 PM. Cuba Sí Yanquis No. Ferroviaria de Cuba." Final rows depict a military honor guard rendering homage to an unidentified delegation of foreign officials on the steps of Cuba's Presidential Palace, as shown also in Print 39.

                        <p>Scenes of Sukarno's arrival at the airport in Havana and images of his official reception by President Dorticós, Prime Minister Fidel Castro and INRA director Antonio Nuñez Jiménez. Frames 13-21 show the official caravan of dignitaries as they drive through the streets of Havana on their way from the airport. Crowds toss carnations at the passing car and motorcade. Final frames 2-4 of this sheet show Captain William Morgan, a U.S. volunteer officer in Fidel Castro's guerrilla army, who became the director of an experimental state cooperative dedicated to the production of bull frogs for export after 1959. These frames show him examining a printed document that appears to be a newspaper clipping. Frame 4 has Morgan standing next to an unidentified Cuban man in glasses. Morgan was later executed for treason and accused of cooperating with the CIA in 1961.</p>

                        <p>This set of prints documents a visit to Nicaragua that St. George appears to have made in late May or early June of 1959, after a long stay in Cuba earlier that year. On May 30, 1959, Luis Somoza Debayle, who ruled Nicaragua from 1956 to 1963 following the assassination of his father, the dictator Anastasio Somoza García, put down an attempted uprising against the government led by groups who found their inspiration in the Cuban Revolution. Luis's brother, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, replaced his father as the commander of the United States-trained National Guard, a legacy of the United States' long military occupation of Nicaragua that began with the landing of Marines in 1912 and continued (with a brief reprieve in 1925) through 1933. St. George interviewed both of the Somoza brothers (see especially Prints 1, 2, 16 for closeup images of Luis, and Prints 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19 for images of Anastasio, Jr.). Prints 10, 13, 14, 17 show police and military officials stopping citizens on the streets, some of whom are probably students. Although tiny in number, the student body of Nicaragua's only university in Managua were famously critical of the Somoza regime and were likely to have been the primary subject of these random checks and searches. Print 22 appears to show the processing of a large number of civilians in a police station, including one Catholic priest; it also shows several soldiers inspecting caches of ammunition. Print 24 shows several National Guardsmen questioning a well-dressed woman at the door of a middle-class home. Print 26 shows St. George in the company of an unidentified American, who appears in the role of a journalist in Print 4 but is here shown carrying a rifle and dressed in full military fatigues; several shots also in Print 26 show them drinking from a bottle of rum. Also in these images, National Guardsmen are shown in the act of arresting a small unit of guerrillas who appear with their hands up in a position of surrender. Print 20 provides more complete documentation of the surrender of these men and their subsequent capture by National Guardsmen, including images of the guerrillas posting a white flag of surrender before their safehouse, and various stages of their capture by the National Guard. Print 21 includes close-up images of some of those guerrillas arrested. Prints 3, 4, 5, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29 document the National Guard column involved in this operation, named "Columna San Jacinto," in Print 25.</p>

                        <p>Two unrelated sets of images appear in this print. The top three rows show Fidel Castro in close-up, as well as several unidentified peasants, probably taken in late 1958 at La Plata, guerrilla army headquarters. The bottom rows show David Salvador, Secretary General of the CTC, addressing the general Congress of worker delegates that met in November of 1959 in Havana; the last row of images shows Fidel Castro addressing workers at the subsequent congress of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores del Azucar [FNTA], held in Havana in December of 1959. Further documentation of both workers' congresses can be found in Contact Book VIII. See also Prints 30, 33, 38, 39 and Contact Book VIII.</p>

                        <p>Two sets of apparently unrelated images. The top four rows of images show a massive Catholic religious procession in which the image of Jesus Christ is carried on a flowered litter through the streets of an unidentified provincial city, possibly Santa Clara. The bottom two rows of images show Faure Chomón Mediavilla, a former leader of the Directorio Revolucionario, an organization of university students that together with the Organización Auténtica, carried out a failed assault on the Presidential Palace on March 13, 1957, for the sole purpose of assassinating the dictator Fulgencio Batista. After the failure of the plan and the arrest or killing without trial of most of its participants, Chomón joined others in founding and directing the operations of a second guerrilla front in the Escambray mountains of Santa Clara province for the remainder of the war. Chomón remains a central figure in Cuba's Castro-led government. Here, Chomón is making a televised appearance in which he responds to the questions of two unidentified journalists (seated to his right), also serving as hosts.</p>

                        <p>Two unrelated sets of images appear in this print. Top three rows show Fidel Castro addressing the public in a televised speech, made in 1960. Before him sits a small plaque announcing the name of a new broadcast chain called "FIEL" (or "Faithful"). Although folder is marked "June 1960," it is unlikely that the bottom three rows of images were taken then because they include David Salvador, the Secretary General of the Confederación de Trabajadores Cubanos [CTC], Cuba's largest labor union, who was publicly disgraced as a counterrevolutionary and accused of corruption after he criticized the revolutionary government's efforts to control the labor union's decision and governing body in April of 1960. Here he is shown alongside Fidel Castro and others, an impossibility following that process. Bottom three rows feature images of participants and worker delegates at what appears to be the inauguration of the congress of the CTC, held in Havana in November of 1959. Frames 22-26 feature Violeta Casals, a radio personality who lent her voice to Radio Rebelde, Cuba's clandestine radio program before the triumph of revolutionary forces against Batista in January of 1959. Frames 12-13 in the bottom row of images show Fidel Castro consulting with Osmani Cienfuegos; David Salvador sits at his side taking notes. Frames 14 and 15 feature an unidentified man sitting with the revolutionary leadership at the head table, clapping. Frame 16 shows Salvador with an unidentified man wearing a militia uniform, beret rolled under a shoulder epaulet, at his side. See also Contact Book VIII; Prints 32, 37 and 39.</p>

These images depict David Salvador (top row) with unidentified militiaman at his side, apparently attending the congress of the CTC in Havana, November 1959. Frame 21 shows Violeta Casals, a radio personality who lent her voice to Radio Rebelde, Cuba's clandestine radio program before the triumph of revolutionary forces against Batista in January of 1959. The third row of images shows worker delegates cheering in response to a speaker whose identity is unclear, images of the same unidentified man who is shown clapping in Print 38 and images of Fidel Castro consulting with David Salvador. Bottom frames depict the performance of a visiting Soviet Bloc dance troupe to Havana, taken several months later in the spring of 1960. See also Contact Book VIII; Prints 38, 50.</p>

                        <p>This print, together with Print 41, features scenes from Fidel Castro's triumphant entrance into Havana after a seven-day caravan by car, helicopter and plane that stopped in every major city and town from Oriente to the capital. Frames 11-12, 13-15 show St. George aboard the military aircraft that carried Fidel for the final leg of the journey and his arrival at a military base in Havana (frames 16-19; 19-24). Frame 25 shows Fidel as he approaches the Presidential Palace and his arm around his shoulders, consults with a fellow unidentified guerrilla. Frames 27-29 show him making his way on foot through the streets of Havana and frames 30-31 show his arrival at the Havana Hilton, which he would designate his personal headquarters for the first two months or more of the Revolution.

                        <p>These prints (June or July 1958) document the final days of captivity for a group of United States citizens who were captured and held hostage by Raúl Castro's forces in June of 1958. Released a few at a time over the course of the summer, the hostages were part of an overall military strategy Raúl dubbed "Operación Anti-Aérea," or Operation Anti-Aircraft. These hostages were United States employees of a local mining company based in Nícaro, part of the area of Oriente province that Raúl Castro's forces controlled. In taking the hostages, Raúl hoped to achieve at least two goals: first he hoped to use them as human shields against the bombing raids that Batista's air force, supported by United States weaponry, continued to make on civilians in the zone; and second, he wanted to prompt direct negotiations with representatives of the United States government for the safe return of the hostages. Such negotiations would have represented official recognition of the rebel army as the sovereign authority in the zone by a foreign government. St. George documents the treatment of the hostages, their apparent joy upon being told of their imminent release and the landing of a United States-piloted helicopter to recover the hostages.</p>

                           <p>Top rows of frames depict a group of rebels in a requisitioned truck as they inspect the damage they have apparently done to building belonging to a sugar mill. Row two shows the rebels driving past a railroad car loaded with sugar cane that has been abandoned on the tracks, as well as a picture of Efigenio Ameijeiras sitting at table. The next row, frame 1, and the final, fourth row of frames show Ameijeiras and several other rebels, sitting at a table inside a wooden building; two of the men, sitting at the head of the table and facing the camera are probably part of the group of United States hostages taken earlier that summer. Row three shows Efigenio Ameijeiras and other rebels as seen through the front window of a jeep parked alongside a road. Frames 19 and 20 show a local black peasant balancing a bunch of bananas on his head and holding a plate of ground corn. The last frame in the third row shows the exterior of the wooden building where the hostages are being kept. At the front door stands an armed guard who is flanked by two hand-painted signs, apparently meant to throw off any suspicion of its use as a rebel hideout or a relic of the building's former use by Batista forces: (on the left) "Viva Batista y su ejército," (on the right) "La razón La justicia La tiene Batista."</p>

                           <p>These images document the release of United States hostages taken and held by Raúl Castro's forces in June and July of 1958. Frame 13 appears to show two of the hostages as their rebel guard informs them of the helicopter's arrival and subsequent frame depicts their farewells with the rebels and departure.</p>

                        <p>Images showing Fidel Castro as he leaves an impromptu meeting with Herbert Matthews and his wife Nancie (row one) in the days following the fall of the Batista government and the triumph of revolutionary forces. Subsequent images show events taking place at a military base littered with empty wooden boxes of ammunition (frames 23 and 24) and housing a number of military planes, a tank and trucks. Fidel Castro appears in bottom three rows with unidentified guerrillas speaking to uniformed members of Batista's airforce as they all squat or kneel on the ground. Frame 34 shows three unidentified guerrilla officers with a man wearing a white guayabera and linen pants. See also Prints 32 and 34.</p>

                        <p>The top three rows and bottom two rows show images of an unidentified man smoking a cigar and sitting at his desk in an office. Frames 33-37 show the same man examining a newspaper on a podium-style desk with a large salon in the background. This appears to form part of a large newspaper office, for its size, possibly Diario de la Marina, which was housed in a large building on Prado, directly facing the Capitolio. This was the first national newspaper to be occupied by militias loyal to the government and nationalized for supporting counterrevolutionary activities in May of 1960. See also Contact Book 9.</p>

Men and voluptuous woman standing with him are unidentified. Subsequent frames show an unidentified man wearing a suit and smoking a cigar.

                        <p>Images compiled on contact sheet are unrelated to one another. Bottom images numbered 4-5 show the stage of the CTC Congress held in Havana in November of 1959, further documented in Contact Book VII. Middle images show a stage surrounded by a large crowd in what was then called the Palacio Deportivo, now called la Ciudad Deportiva. The table that appears in the middle of the stage features a drape with lettering that reads "Conferencia Latinoamericana." Frame 35 shows Vilma Espín sitting on a panel with unidentified participants as they listen to a speaker reading from a paper and standing before a microphone to the left. See also Print 53.</p>

                        <p>This sheet has four unrelated images. Frame 6 shows a guerrilla soldier holding a camera and taking a picture of St. George; next to him is another rebel and in the background is a small military outpost built during the Batista-era for policing the countryside. Because the soldier with the camera wears a handmade armband of the 26th of July Movement, it is likely that this picture was taken in the early months of 1959. The adjacent frame shows an elderly militiaman standing amidst a field strewn with various oil or munition barrels. Frame 16 shows the cashier of a casino standing at his post as a tourist appears to be cashing in his chips. The final frame, numbered 15, shows airport skycaps unloading luggage from the cargo hold of an airplane.</p>

                        <p>Printed images taken from several different contact sheets. The bottom row of images, showing Raúl Castro and Felipe Guerra Matos, are duplicates of shots that appear in Print 14 of Contact Book I. Top row of images shows three unidentified women sitting on a couch in what appears to be a waiting room, also pictured in Print 53; one is black and very elegantly dressed. The middle row of images shows Raúl Castro standing in the doorway of a peasant hut, with his back to the camera.</p>

                     <p>Summary (English)</p>
                     <p>Filmed at Oriente Province and Sierra Maestra (Provincia de Oriente y La Sierra Maestra).</p>
                     <p>Film in black and white, without sound, taken in various locations of the Sierra Maestra. Venues include towns temporarily occupied by rebel forces under the command of Fidel Castro; rebel campsites high in the mountains; and areas around the town of El Cobre, where Cuba's national shrine to the Virgin of Charity is located. Rebel soldiers, on horseback and on foot, appear marching, showing off their weapons, in individual poses and in groups. Featured are the following scenes in the order in which they appear:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>A man being treated at a first aid post under Che Guevara's command and manned by Dr. Sergio del Valle, who became Minister of Interior in the 1960s under the revolutionary government.</item>
                        <item>Che Guevara in the process of removing the fuse from a dud bomb collected from the areas populated by mountain peasants and targeted by Batista's air force; the TNT that these dud bombs contained was extracted and transferred to a rebel bomb-making workshop for use in crafting small bombs used as hand grenades.</item>
                        <item>Comandante Camilo Cienfuegos (with cigar clenched in his mouth) leading his troops, one of whom carries a guitar.</item>
                        <item>Ramiro Valdés astride a horse.</item>
                        <item>The rebels' principal bomb-making workshop.</item>
                        <item>Rebel headquarters at La Plata where Fidel Castro issues orders to the army.</item>
                        <item>Rebel soldiers on a march.</item>
                        <item>Fidel Castro examining a map placed on a table in front of peasant-style hut; to his immediate left is Cresencio Pérez, the first small land-holding peasant of the region to side with the rebels and provide sanctuary when they first arrived in the mountains and were scattered by advancing government forces in December and January 1956-1957.</item>
                        <item>Rebel soldiers on a march.</item>
                        <item>Large shipment of crates and other boxed goods arriving at a sea port in Oriente; St. George believed that these were weapons being shipped by the United States to re-supply Batista's forces secretly at a time when a moratorium on future arms sales had been officially declared.</item>
                        <item>Cresencio Pérez and other rebel officers examine a map.</item>
                        <item>Che Guevara assembling small handmade grenades out of the TNT he retrieved from dud bombs dropped by enemy aircraft; note that he is carrying one of St. George's cameras on his hip. St George claimed he communicated with the rebels through Che since the former did not know Spanish but both Che and he spoke French fluently. St. George also credited Che with taking many of the early pictures of rebels that appear in the photograph section of this series.</item>
                        <item>Fidel Castro in the company of a rebel officer; many soldiers resting and reclining in area around him.</item>
                        <item>Rebel soldiers on a march.</item>
                        <item>Group of rebels standing with Camilo Cienfuegos.</item>
                        <item>Fidel Castro laughing with a rebel officer; many soldiers resting and reclining in area around him.</item>
                        <item>Che Guevara putting together a handmade grenade.</item>
                        <item>Duplicate footage of Sergio del Valle's medical post.</item>
                        <item>Cresencio Pérez examining a map with two rebel officers, who are then joined by Fidel (emerging from the bohío behind them).</item>
                        <item>Rebel soldiers on a march.</item>
                        <item>Radio Rebelde, the clandestine radio station that permitted the rebels to contradict false government news reports and evade the censors that plagued the mainstream media. The radio station, manned by chief radio officer Manuel Fernández, was located at rebel headquarters in La Plata. A prayer card to the Virgin of Charity is seen behind the microphone.</item>
                        <item>Brief shot of three rebel officers; the man to the far right is René Rodríguez.</item>
                        <item>The rebels' first temporary occupation of a town: Las Minas de Charco Redondo.</item>
                        <item>The national shrine of the Virgin of Charity is seen in the center; the man in the film is Capt. Rigoberto Ramírez. St George reports that his forces seized the town of Minas del Cobre the following day.</item>
                        <item>Fidel Castro planning military moves as rebel officers listen; according to St. George, this scene was staged for the benefit of the filmmakers.</item>
                        <item>René Rodríguez welcoming a platoon of rebels arriving at camp.</item>
                        <item>The rebel take-over of the town of Charco Redondo.</item>

                        <item>Extensive footage documenting the capture and release of several United States citizens who were employees of the Nícaro Nickel Company in the mining zone. They were captured by the column of Raúl Castro in the summer 1958. Called "Operación Anti-Áerea," the strategy was launched with the capture of forty-eight United States and Canadian hostages (including twenty-eight United States Marines) in retaliation for the continued re-supplying of Batista's forces by the United States under cover of the United States naval base at Guantánamo. The hostages served as a human shield that protected Raúl's own forces from bombing raids and also resulted in the first direct contact between the rebels and United States consular and intelligence officials who negotiated their release in August. The scenes feature Raúl Castro, his future wife and then secretary, Vilma Espín, members of Raúl's column, Andrew St. George, and CBS newsman Robert Taber. The hostages are interviewed in the film as they are being shown pieces of shrapnel from bombs dropped by Batista's air force and supplied by the United States, despite the latter's official moratorium on providing weapons to Batista that was put in place in March 1958. These images were taken in early July, when St. George and Taber crash-landed a plane in order to scoop the story and get the first pictures of the hostages out of Cuba. All of the hostages featured in the film are employees of the United States government-owned Nícaro Nickel Company of Oriente. The last scene shows the jeep requisitioned by the rebels from the company and used to transport the hostages following the rebels' negotiation of their release with United States officials.</item>
                        <item>Las Minas de Charco Redondo. In the center of the screen to the left is Humberto Sorí Marín, the rebels' first Judge Advocate General and former president of the Inter-American Bar Association. Sorí Marín joined Fidel's column at the very start of the guerrilla war but then turned against the post-1959 revolutionary government in which he served as first Minister of Agriculture during passage of the Agrarian Reform. When the Revolution sought an alignment with the Soviet Union and turned toward Communism, Sorí Marín began to conspire with others to overthrow the government. He was arrested in March 1961, together with a number of other former guerrilla officers including the American, William Morgan. Accused of collaborating with the CIA, Sorí Marín was executed for treason against the Revolution. In reality, he was conspiring to unite all anti-Castro forces on the island.</item>

                        <item>Largas secuencias que documentan la captura y liberación de varios cuidadanos norteamericanos, empleados de la Nicaro Níckel Company, en la zona minera, por la columna de Raúl Castro in el verano de 1958. Llamada "Operación Antiaérea", este plan consistió en la captura de 48 rehenes ciudadanos nortemericanos y canadienses (incluyendo 28 marines) en represalia por el continuo reabastecimiento de las fuerzas de Batista por los Estados Unidos bajo la protección de la Base Naval de Guantánamo. Los rehenes sirvieron como escudo humano que protegió a las propias fuerzas de Raúl de los bombardeos, además de que resultó en el primer contacto entre los rebeldes y los funcionarios consulares y de inteligencia norteamericanos, los cuales negociaron la liberación de los prisioneros en Agosto del mismo año. Las escenas muestran a Raúl Castro, a quien fuera esposa luego su esposa Vilma Espín, a miembros de la columna de Raúl, Andrew St George, y el periodista de la CBS Robert Taber. Los rehenes son entrevistados en el filme, a medida que se les muestra fragmentos de metralla provenientes de bombas lanzadas por la Fuerza Aerea batistiana, suministradas por Estados Unidos, a pesar de la suspensión de suministro de armas a Batista puesta en vigor desde Marzo de 1958. Estas imágenes fueron tomadas a principios de Julio, cuando St George y Taber aterrizaron forzosamente para cubrir esta historia y sacar las primeras imágenes de los rehenes fuera de Cuba. Todos los rehenes que se ven en la película son empleados de la compañía del gobierno norteamericano, Nicaro Nickel Company de Oriente. La ultmia escena muestra el jeep confiscado por los rebeldes a la compañía y que usan para transportar a sus rehenes luego de la negociación de su liberación con los funcionarios norteamericanos.</item>
                        <item>La escena final de la película muestras Las Minas de Charco Redonde. En el centro de la pantalla, hacia la izquierda está Humberto Sorí Marín, el primer Fiscal General rebelde, expresidente de la Inter-American Bar Association. Sorí Marín se unió a la columna de Fidel al comienzo de la guerra de guerrillas pero luego se puso en contra del gobierno revolucionario, después de 1959, en el que fungía como Ministro de Agricultura durante la aprobación de la Reforma Agraria. Sorí Marín comenzó a conspirar con otros para derrocar al gobierno cuando la Revolución buscó alinearse con la Unión Soviética y dio un giro hacia el Comunismo. Fue arrestado en Marzo de 1961, junto con a otros exoficiales guerrilleros, incluyendo William Morgan. Acusado de colaborar con la CIA, fue ejecutado por traición contra la Revolución. En realidad, Sorí Marín estaba conspirando para unificar todas las fuerzas anticastristas en la isla.</item>

                     <p>Filmed in liberated zones controlled by the rebel army in the plains and mountains of Oriente province (Zonas liberadas controladas por el Ejercito Rebelde en los llanos y las montañas de la Provincia de Oriente).</p>
                     <p>Black and white film, without sound, shot in various locations in the camps of the rebel army in the Sierra Maestra that were commanded by Fidel Castro. There is also footage of the liberation of the city of Guantánamo, a major government military base in Oriente bordering the United States naval base on Guantánamo Bay, on January 1, 1959, shortly after the announced departure of the dictator Fulgencio Batista for refuge in the Dominican Republic. The film features the following scenes described in order of their appearance:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>The rebels' first successful occupation of a local town, Las Minas de Charco Redondo. Guerrillas known as the "Pardo Brothers" ride horses requisitioned temporarily by the rebels during the course of their daylong occupation of the town.</item>
                        <item>A group of rebel officers standing in the shade of palm trees shortly after the arrival of the platoon to the camp. On the far left is a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who had joined the guerrillas and become their chief bomb-maker. Fourth from the left is René Rodríguez. Behind him is a woman wearing sun glasses, possibly Celia Sánchez. At the far right of the screen, as the camera pans right, stands an unidentified woman wearing a light-colored, sleeveless shirt from which hangs a badge attached by a pin. She is carrying a purse over one shoulder.</item>
                        <item>Las Minas de Charco Redondo. In the center of the footage, to the left, is Humberto Sorí Marín, the rebels' first Judge Advocate General and former president of the Inter-American Bar Association. Sorí Marín joined Fidel's column at the very start of the guerrilla war but then turned against the post-1959 revolutionary government in which he served as first Minister of Agriculture during passage of the Agrarian Reform. When the Revolution sought an alignment with the Soviet Union and turned toward Communism, Sorí Marín began to conspire with others to overthrow the government. He was arrested in March 1961, together with a number of other former guerrilla officers including the American, William Morgan. Accused of collaborating with the CIA, Sorí Marín was executed for treason against the Revolution. In reality, he was conspiring to unite all the anti-Castro forces on the island.</item>
                        <item>The township of Matías. With his back to the camera is a rebel officer whom St. George identified as Manuel Boronato (or Boronat), speaking to his platoon. The men prepare to stage a foot patrol of the town in order to ascertain whether there are any government troops (such as town police) in hiding. According to St. George, this occupation took place two months after the rebels' first take-over of a town, Las Minas de Charco Redondo.</item>

St. George, one of only two journalists (both foreign) to accompany the convoy and ride in the jeep directly behind Fidel's car, remarked in response to seeing the film he shot of the convoy, "This convoy which, as I say, drove from Santiago to Havana and on occasion, consisted of 70 to 80 to 90 vehicles, parts of it lapped each other, and we would then at the principal cities where Fidel called a halt, would all stop and then again drive along. Holguín, Matanzas, Santa Clara, Camagüey. It was a strategically very shrewd plan. It meant that Fidel had no hostile garrisons in this region when he arrived in Havana."</item>

Los guerrilleros conocidos como los "Hermanos Pardo" se ven montando en caballos confiscados temporalmente por los rebeldes durante el curso de la ocupación del pueblo que duró un día.</item>
                        <item>Un grupo de oficiales rebeldes están a la sombra de una palma poco después de la llegada de un pelotón al campamento.

En el centro de la pantalla, hacia la izquierda está Humberto Sorí Marín, el primer Fiscal General rebelde, expresidente de la Inter-American Bar Association. Sorí Marín se unió a la columna de Fidel al comienzo de la guerra de guerrillas pero luego se puso en contra del gobierno revolucionario después de 1959, en el que fungía como Ministro de Agricultura durante la aprobación de la Reforma Agraria. Sorí Marín comenzó a conspirar con otros para derrocar al gobierno cuando la Revolución buscó alinearse con la Unión Soviética y dio un giro hacia el Comunismo. Fue arrestado en Marzo de 1961, junto con a otros exoficiales guerrilleros, incluyendo William Morgan. Acusado de colaborar con la CIA, fue ejecutado por traición contra la Revolución. En realidad, Sorí Marín estaba conspirando para unificar todas las fuerzas anticastristas en la isla.</item>

Holguin, Matanzas, Santa Clara, Camaguey. Fue un plan estrategico bien concebido. Significó que Fidel no tuviera cuarteles hostiles en esta región cuando llegara a la Habana"</item>

                        <item>Extensive footage documenting the capture and release of several United States citizens who were employees of the Nícaro Nickel Company in the mining zone. They were captured by the column of Raúl Castro in the summer 1958. Called "Operación Anti-Áerea," the strategy was launched with the capture of forty-eight United States and Canadian hostages (including twenty-eight United States Marines) in retaliation for the continued re-supplying of Batista's forces by the United States under cover of the United States naval base at Guantánamo. The hostages served as a human shield that protected Raúl's own forces from bombing raids and also resulted in the first direct contact between the rebels and United States consular and intelligence officials who negotiated their release in August. The scenes feature Raúl Castro, his future wife and then secretary, Vilma Espín, members of Raúl's column, Andrew St. George, and CBS newsman Robert Taber. The hostages are interviewed in the film as they are being shown pieces of shrapnel from bombs dropped by Batista's air force and supplied by the United States, despite the latter's official moratorium on providing weapons to Batista that was put in place in March 1958. These images were taken in early July, when St. George and Taber crash-landed a plane in order to scoop the story and get the first pictures of the hostages out of Cuba. All of the hostages featured in the film are employees of the United States government-owned Nícaro Nickel Company of Oriente. The last scene shows the jeep requisitioned by the rebels from the company and used to transport the hostages following the rebels' negotiation of their release with United States officials.</item>

Denominada como "Operación Antiaérea", la estrategia comenzó con la captura de 48 rehenes norteamericanos y canadienses (incluyendo 28 marines norteamericanos) en represalia por el continuado reabastecimiento de las fuerzas batistiana por parte de Estados Unidos bajo la covertura de la base naval norteamericana de Guantánamo. Estos rehenes sirvieron como escudo humano que protegió a las propias fuerzas de Raúl de los bombardeos y también resultó en el primer contacto directo entre los rebeldes y los funcionarios consulares y de inteligencia norteamericanos con los rebeldes, los cuales negociaron su liberación en Agosto de ese año. Las escenas muestran a Raúl Castro, su futura esposa y entonces secretaria, Vilma Espín, miembros de la columna de Raúl, Andrew St George, y el periodista de la CBS Robert Taber. Los rehenes son entrevistados en el filme, a medida que se les muestra fragmentos de metralla provenientes de bombas lanzadas por la Fuerza Aerea batistiana, suministradas por Estados Unidos, a pesar de la suspensión de suministro de armas a Batista puesta en vigor desde Marzo de 1958. Estas imágenes fueron tomadas a principios de Julio, cuando St George y Taber aterrizaron forzosamente para cubrir esta historia y sacar las primeras imágenes de los rehenes fuera de Cuba. Todos los rehenes que se ven en la película son empleados de la compañía del gobierno norteamericano, Nicaro Nickel Company de Oriente. La ultmia escena muestra el jeep confiscado por los rebeldes a la compañía y que usan para transportar a sus rehenes luego de la negociación de su liberación con los funcionarios norteamericanos.</item>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is comprised of photographs and films that primarily document the response of students and working-class Cubans to the Revolution. There are forty-six films from 1969, many of them with sound, of daily life in a Cuban school, women's labor camp, sugar cane worker brigade, and the Urbano Noris sugar mill. There are also interviews with orientadores rurales about their political education duties. Excerpts from the films can be seen in the copy of the 1970 documentary, Compañeras y Compañeros, produced by David C. Stone, Barbara Stone, and Adolfas Mekas, which is included in the series.</p>
               <p>Original film titles were provided by the creator. The Spanish descriptions of the films were written by Jorge Macle Cruz, vice director of research at the Archivo Nacional de la Republica de Cuba. The English descriptions were written by Yale University Assistant Professor of History and Cuba specialist Lillian Guerra. "Alternative titles" are provided by Professor Guerra when needed to more accurately describe film contents. When provided, running time refers to the DVD running time.</p>
               <p>The archival film in this series is in DV format, digitized from a 16 mm original. The film was created by David C. Stone, Barbara Stone, Ukranian co-producer Adolfas Mekas, and the workers of Cuba's state movie industry, el Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográfica (ICAIC). These included Camilo Vives (producer), Leonardo Sorrel (sound), Rafael Rey (driver), Rafael Martos (driver), as well as an unidentified Swedish woman and an unidentified North American, probably from the United States. Both Rafael Rey and Rafael Martos worked for Cuban state security, although this was unknown to the Stones at the time of the filming.</p>

                     <p>Summary (English)</p>
                     <p>Feature film in color, with some scenes in black and white, and subtitled in English, that was directed by David C. Stone, Barbara Stone and Adolfas Mekas, a Lithuanian filmmaker residing in the United States. Mostly comprised of footage contained in Series II of the Cuban Revolution Collection in Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library. The film features highly edited scenes in which narrative voices are supplied entirely by the Cuban subjects of the film. Most prominent are scenes of members of the Columna Juvenil del Centenario (documented in Films 15-20), the sugar mill "Urbano Noris" (Films 28-34), peasants interviewed in the presence of orientadores rurales, as well as the orientadores themselves (Films 36-43b) and the Vento School (Films 1-14). Images not filmed in Cuba that convey a sense of the power and hostility of the United States toward Latin American revolutionary movements and the Cuban Revolution in particular also appear in the movie. These images depict the Vietnam War, political caricatures made before 1959, and the School of the Americas in Fort Bragg, Georgia. At the school, the United States government trained tens of thousands of Latin American military forces in counterinsurgency techniques, including those from El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, and Chile, as well as such officials as Augusto Pinochet.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color taken in various locations at the Vento School. This film was taken in a series of cuts in which the following locations and activities are recorded:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>In-class pedagogical exercise popularized in revolutionary schools as a means by which to educate students in the analysis and critique of capitalist societies. This exercise, called "cine-debate," involved the viewing of a United States-made movie followed by a discussion of its contents as an accurate representation of life in a capitalist society. The movie discussed in this clip deals with a married couple. No title of the movie is provided.</item>
                           <item>Literature class in which a young "monitora" leads a discussion of Ernest Hemingway's, The Old Man and the Sea. In the late 1960s, as Cuba's secondary school system expanded rapidly, the government devised a program to fill the massive deficit in the number of teachers available after the vast majority of public school teachers left the country between 1961 and 1965. This program relied on dedicated but untrained "monitors" who were the most advanced students of the ninth and tenth grades to serve as teachers to younger students. In this clip, a monitor leads the students in discussing Hemingway's novel in the most simplistic of terms, such as the nature of life for fishermen in Cuba, the strength of sea currents, the existence of plankton, the four cardinal points, the struggle between man and nature, and finally, the depth at which one may find a variety of sea creatures. In the background hangs the flag of Bolivia.</item>
                           <item>Visual arts class. Students can be seen painting in watercolor and oil on paper.</item>
                           <item>English language class. The class discussion is guided by the use of audiovisual and televisual equipment.</item>
                           <item>Mathematics class focused on the study and solution of various geometry problems. Note that the national slogan for the year 1969 can be seen in the background: "Año del Esfuerzo Decisivo" or "Year of the Decisive Effort."</item>
                           <item>In the background in the film clips is a mural reading "La Nueva Tarea es Mañalich" or "The New Task is Mañalich." This refers to the mobilization of volunteer work brigades to be organized by the school for the purpose of participating in the "Ten Million Ton Sugar Harvest" of 1969-1970. Brigades from the Vento School would be assigned to the sugar mill and plantation that the Revolution had renamed "Gregorio Arlee Mañalich," located in Melena del Sur, in the province of Havana.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial level in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                        <p>Film in color that documents a history class held at the Vento School. In the course of the film, analytical references are made to the thirteen colonies of English North America and to the colonies of Spanish America as a whole in order to explain why the former underwent capitalist development and the latter did not. At the same time, students refer to the forms and methods on which capitalism relies to penetrate Latin American countries and perpetuate its control over their political economies. In the back of the classroom is a reproduction of the now-iconic image of Ernesto Che Guevara, taken by the Cuban photographer Korda.</p>
                        <p>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</p>
                        <p>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</p>

                        <p>Film in color taken during the course of various extra-curricular activities, related to government promotion of volunteer labor, on the campus grounds and rural areas in the immediate vicinity. Volunteer labor formed the basis of what government officials hoped would become an entirely communist economy driven by moral rather than material incentives, as well as collective rather than individual interests. Taken in a number of interrupted segments, the film shows students gathered at morning assembly in the school courtyard, as well as on the march and in the fields of the Cordón de la Habana. The film includes the following scenes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Students in the courtyard of the school as a small group of girls and one boy carry out a musical skit related to the Ten Million Ton Harvest.</item>
                           <item>Students sit in the shade of trees as they wait for transport to the coffee fields. (The transport never arrives.) As they wait, they play a numbers game among themselves and laugh wildly.</item>
                           <item>A young woman leader of the school announces that the students should each pick up a hoe and proceed to walk to the agricultural fields since the buses did not arrive. They then march to the agricultural fields, talking and singing. At one point, the students can be heard singing the Spanish version of the Beatles song, "Life Goes On," as well as the song sung in the morning assembly musical skit about the Ten Million Ton Harvest.</item>
                           <item>Students in the fields working under the high afternoon sun, cutting the tall grasses around coffee bushes that are being choked by weeds. In the background, a girl can be heard singing a romantic love ballad over the microphone as the others work.</item>
                           <item>Students drinking water at the end of their labor.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Cordon de la Habana, site of the student brigade's labors, was a project that uprooted fruit orchards around the city of Havana and replaced them with coffee bushes tended by volunteers. It represented one of Fidel Castro's many ambitious plans meant to deal with food shortages in Cuba that had resulted from complications related to the implementation of socialism and resistance to it. In this case, coffee from the Cordon was meant to address coffee shortages caused by the elimination of privately owned coffee farms in the highland regions, the increasing subjugation of those that remained to state planners in Havana, and the criminalization of market exchanges outside those governed by the state.</item>

En un momento de espera antes de comenzar a laborar aparecen cantando la versión en español de la canción "Obbladí-Obbladá" de The Beatles. Los estudiantes en el campo laboran a pleno sol guataqueando y chapeando alrededor de plantas de café, mientras en off se escucha a una chica cantando una balada romántica.</item>

                        <p>Film in color taken during a meeting in the theatre of the Vento School, as well as in the cane fields of the sugar mill and plantation named "Gregorio Arlee Mañalich." Scenes documented in the film are:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The meeting of all able-bodied male students in the theatre of the school for nomination and assignment to volunteer labor brigades that would be cutting cane on Sunday for the Ten Million Ton Harvest at the sugar mill, "Gregorio Arlee Mañalich." A young woman named "Meche" who also occupies a high-ranking position in the Juventud Comunista and serves as a monitora at the school explains that the brigades will be cutting cane on two Sundays every month and that nominations for members should be made by the students themselves. The goal is to nominate students with some previous experience cutting cane and they should have enough nominees to make up at least one brigade. Some of the students show great interest in beginning the nomination process. Suddenly, a Communist Party leader (dirigente), whose last name is Chávez, emphasizes the need for experienced cane cutters and raises the ideal number of brigades formed from one to two. He also notes the fact that there are 104 male students in attendance.</item>
                           <item>Student labor brigade working in cane field for the first time. The driver of the bus that took the students to the fields and who says that he is normally part of Cuba's armed forces, or Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR), tries to teach the students how to cut the cane correctly, so that it can produce the maximum amount of sugar and so that none of the sugar content is lost due to poor cutting techniques or lack of skills. Some of the students state that they like to work in cane more than coffee and others attest that they have cut cane over a three month period in Jovellanos, a province of Matanzas. On two occasions, David Stone questions the driver and cane-cutting instructor about the quality of the students' work given their obvious lack of skill and alacrity. The driver states that their enthusiasm makes up for their lack of skills since he believes that they are contributing very effectively to the new society Cuba is trying to build. The driver also cites José Martí in making his point.</item>

During their snack time, they consume a small sandwich and drink a malted beverage known as "malta" in Cuba. They also estimate that they have cut far more than the goal, that is, between six and seven thousand arrobas of cane.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color in which a seventeen-year-old boy named Lázaro is interviewed and reveals information about himself and the origins of the Vento School:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Lázaro is from the province of Pinar del Río. The interview was conducted in the presence of the boy's family, who traveled from Pinar del Río to Havana to visit on one of the weekends in which he enjoys a "pase," that is, time off from regularized duties such as volunteer labor required at the school, which followed a military-style organization. In the course of the interview, Lázaro explains that he has only one year left before he begins college and that he is the son of a housewife and the Chief of Personnel for the Provincial Delegation of the Consejo Nacional de Cultura in Pinar del Río. Lázaro also details how he was admitted to Vento, where he began his secondary school studies, recounting that he participated as a monitor of geography in a national competition for students that later held an award ceremony in the Charles Chaplin Theatre of Havana. At that ceremony, held September 9, 1966, Lázaro explains, Fidel conceived the idea of founding a school for all of the winning students, a school that would embrace all grades from primary school to high school. He clarifies that the large number of pupils eventually required that there be two schools, one at Vento for the older students and one at Punta Brava for primary school students.</item>
                           <item>Lázaro confirms his willingness to remain working as a monitor if the government asks him to do so. He also sees his experience in the Ten Million Ton Harvest as a pleasant one, saying that he enjoys cutting cane because it is a very "dynamic" activity and he can see the fruit of his labors immediately. He also notes that this year's harvest will be historic. Additionally, he expresses that the Ministerio de Educación (MINED) has assigned the sugar mill, "Gregorio Arlee Mañalich," to all the students of Havana, not just those of Vento.</item>
                           <item>Lázaro and his brother are said to be militants of the Juventud Comunista (Communist Youth) and former members of the militia known as "José Antonio Echeverría" brigade. He explains that the tasks of Juventud do not differ from those assigned to other young people, but that the young Communists are expected to do better at whatever they are assigned since they are the vanguard. He also insists that there are no problems or conflicts between members and non-members.</item>
                           <item>Lázaro ends the interview by citing the historic glories of the Revolution and commenting on the latest measures taken to defeat the "rezagos," or people who have not changed or abandoned the mentality of the pre-1959 past and continue to desire or defend the right to private property.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                        <p>Película en colores sobre una entrevista a Lázaro, joven de 17 años oriundo de Pinar del Río. Se interroga al joven y a sus familiares -que han acudido a visitarlo durante un fin de semana intermedio al régimen de pase -, sobre distintos aspectos, manifestando faltarle sólo un año para ir a la universidad y ser hijo de un Jefe de Personal de la Delegación Provincial de cultura en Pinar del Río y de una ama de casa. Lázaro rememora cómo fue que matriculó en la escuela donde cursa el preuniversitario, refiriéndose a haber participado en el año 1966, como monitor de la asignatura de Geografía en un concurso nacional y que el 9 de septiembre de aquel año, en el teatro "Charles Chaplin" de La Habana, Fidel plantea la idea de fundar una escuela con todos aquellos alumnos que participaron en aquellos concursos y eventos, gestándose una escuela que abarcaba todos los niveles desde la primaria hasta el preuniversitario, aunque debido a la cantidad de estudiantes fue necesario trasladar la enseñanza primaria a una escuela en Punta Brava y el resto de los estudiantes permanecieron en Vento.</p>
                        <p>Lázaro manifiesta su disposición a seguir de monitor si se lo pidiesen y ve su participación en la zafra como una experiencia agradable, que le gusta cortar caña porque es una actividad muy dinámica y ve el fruto de su trabajo y que la de ese año es una zafra histórica; expresa además, que al Ministerio de Educación (MINED) se le asignó el central "Gregorio Arlee Mañalich" para los estudiantes de La Habana. Lázaro y su hermano son militantes de la Juventud Comunista, la cual tienen como antecesora a la militancia en la Brigada "José Antonio Echeverría" y explica que en cuanto a las tareas, estas son las mismas para todos los jóvenes, pero a los jóvenes comunistas se les exige más por ser la vanguardia, pero no hay problemas entre unos y otros.</p>
                        <p>Finaliza haciendo valoraciones de carácter histórico al triunfo de la Revolución y acerca de las últimas medidas contra los 'rezagos' que quedaban del viejo régimen en cuanto a la propiedad privada.</p>
                        <p>En la actualidad (año 2006) esta institución acaba de ser cedida por el Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) al Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) y funge como hospital para la llamada Operación Milagro.</p>
                        <p>La Escuela de Vento fue el origen de la actual Escuela Vocacional "Vladimir Ilich Lenin"</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color with segments shot along the coast of Miramar neighborhood, west of Havana proper in a region belonging to Playa Municipality, and the lands adjacent to an agronomic field laboratory, apparently near the school. Scenes shown in the film are:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>A teacher and her pupils collecting samples of marine life including sea stars, lobsters, sea worms, a sea anemone, plants, etc. Later the same samples appear in the classroom where they are checked against bibliographic sources. The coastal zone depicted in the film was later occupied by Cuba's Instituto de Oceanología.</item>
                           <item>Two different scenes related to the study of plants in the field. The first scene depicts students gathered in an area adjacent to the laboratory where potted plants can be seen. Here the teacher gives a lesson on the decomposition of plant material and the concentration of nitrogen from such material and its uses. In the second scene, students observe the growth of parasites and fungal diseases on sugar cane in the field.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                           <item>Indistintamente dos escenarios: en uno los alumnos alrededor de un área de estudios anexa al laboratorio donde aparecen macetas de plantas y el profesor explica sobre la materia orgánica y su descomposición, la concentración del nitrógeno, etc. y en otra, los estudiantes observan en la práctica la acción de los parásitos y enfermedades fungosas en la caña de azúcar.</item>
                           <item>En la actualidad (año 2006) esta institución –Escuela de Vento- acaba de ser cedida por el Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) al Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) y funge como hospital para la llamada Operación Milagro.</item>

                        <p>Film in color showing various scenes in which students participate in cultural activities, theatrical performances, or general leisure and recreation through cultural expression. The film depicts the following activities:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Students dancing to the music of a band comprised of other students who sing Spanish-language versions of Beatles songs, including "Life Goes On."</item>
                           <item>Theatrical presentations and dramatic skits that reflect the following themes: a) Comedic scene in which passengers on a bus rumble down a road full of potholes to the beat of a rumba and the same bus as it returns from an excursion to do volunteer labor (generally called 'trabajo productivo" or "productive work" at that time). b) Assembly for the election of youth to the Communist Youth as well as the election of vanguard brigades. c) To the rhythm of a guaguancó, a voice-over can be heard making comments about the pre-1959 past and the post-1959 revolutionary present. d) Dramatic presentation having to do with the publication of something on pathological germs as contrasted with music heard playing in the background and an actor drawing an image of Don Quijote de la Mancha and an antiwar caricature. e) Dramatic reading of an imagined letter written by a United States soldier who describes the war in Vietnam. f) The successful orbit of the United States spaceship Apollo 11. g) Dramatic presentation on Bolivia, its people and post-guerrilla prospects. h) A play in which a group of counterrevolutionaries wait for a ship that is supposed to take them to the United States. They exchange ideas on the rebels before 1959, the pro-Batista faction, and on the attitudes of the rich versus the poor. i) Parody of a televised interview on the theme of the Vietnam War and the death of United States President John F. Kennedy.</item>

                        <p>Film in color taken during the course of a debate led by the student named Lázaro who is a militant of the Juventud Comunista. The discussion takes place on the porch of one of the buildings that faces the courtyard of the school. Its principal theme is the situation in Vietnam. During the discussion, there is no disagreement, but rather the elaboration of the following talking points:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The possibility that the Saigon government would collapse immediately were it not for the presence of United States military forces there to support it.</item>
                           <item>The division of the country into two Vietnams, the South and the North, as a result of the United States presence.</item>

                           <item>The Vietnamese students who are living in Cuba on Cuban government grants.</item>

                           <item>The willingness of Cuba to provide military aid to Vietnam and North Vietnam's refusal to accept assistance of any sort other than technical.</item>
                           <item>The suffering of United States families whose sons have refused to go to Vietnam or whose sons have died fighting there.</item>
                           <item>The students' shared willingness to help all the countries of Latin America and the declaration of mutual support for the official Cuban slogan, "La Revolución somos nosotros" or "The Revolution is all of us."</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit.

                        <p>Film in color that depicts a group of students engaged in a debate on Bolivia that is led by a fellow student, probably a leader of the Juventud Comunista. The discussion focuses on the following themes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Death of El Che, Ernest Guevara; the conditions of the guerrilla in Bolivia; and the manifesto released by fellow guerrilla leader Inti Peredo, one of the sole survivors of the Bolivian army's fateful ambush of Guevara's forces. Months later Peredo would also be killed when 150 police assaulted his home in La Paz on September 9, 1969. His manifesto, written in July 1969 and titled "Volveremos a las Montañas" ("We Shall Return to the Mountains") was one of the required texts studied by the students at the Vento School.</item>
                           <item>Resistance of the local indigenous peasant population to the guerrilla presence in Bolivia, as well as the former's general disinformation about its goals and the lack of communication among different armed guerrilla groups.</item>
                           <item>The guerrilla foco in Peru and analysis of its failure.</item>
                           <item>Divisions among factions of the Communist Party in Bolivia.</item>
                           <item>The Party of Monge.</item>
                           <item>The lack of urban support for the guerrilla.</item>
                           <item>The emergence of guerrilla wars in all parts of the world as a means for eliminating imperialism.</item>
                           <item>A student reading the Cuban magazine, Tricontinental, promoting revolutionary change along similar lines as those of Cuba.</item>
                           <item>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</item>
                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilích Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                        <p>Film in color taken during rehearsal and staging of a variety of Cuban national folklore dances in the theatre of the school. Many of the dances are related to the worship of creolized African deities associated with the Santería religion. Others are folk dances representing the legacy of slavery and slave culture in Cuba. There are no teachers or instructors depicted in the film sequences. Initial cuts feature images of the musicians whose live percussion on Afro-Cuban drums accompanies the dancers. In addition to these scenes of dancing, the film also includes a number of images of different buildings and interior gardens of the Vento School.</p>

                           <item>Their prior service to the Revolution that garnered them the necessary political qualifications (as "integrados," incorporated into the Revolution) that facilitated admission. Such service is described as participation in the 1961 Literacy Campaign, volunteer work picking coffee, and trips to the Sierra Maestra.

                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines.

The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilich Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students who are selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color taken in a classroom in which students belonging to the same section or group attend a disciplinary session presided over by two female leaders (dirigentes) of the Communist Youth (Juventud Comunista) and one male Communist Party member who is a teacher and/or administrator of the school. The students are called upon to exercise a method for discussing one another's personal faults and practical failures known as "criticism and self-criticism" (la crítica y la autocrítica). They are also required to analyze publicly the charges against them which will lead to the assignment of a number of demerits by the dirigentes presiding over the court as judges. Throughout the session, the students charged follow military-style rituals, including the saluting of superior officers who are, in this case, peers who have been elected as leaders of the Juventud Comunista. It is understood that all students must carry with them at all times what is known as "una hoja de corte," that is, a form on which certain students charged with serving as disciplinary agents write down and report any failings of a disciplinary nature.</p>
                        <p>After the initial session of the court ends with the assignment of eight demerits to a student named Nelson, another sequence begins in which a student dirigente of the same group analyzes the behavior of all its members with regard to taking leaves, attendance in classes, and the practice of sports, among other things. The purpose of the discussion is to decide whether or not the group should declare itself exemplary in carrying out the various tasks required of a "Grupo a la Ofensiva" (Group Ready for the Offensive). This term refers to the national program of ideological renewal and revolutionary regeneration initiated in 1967 and spearheaded by Raúl Castro, chief of Cuba's military, known as Las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, or FAR. Called "La Ofensiva Revolucionaria" (Revolutionary Offensive), the program called for the elimination of any remaining privately held businesses regardless of size, the creation of labor camps for the incarceration of citizens selected for re-education by divisions of the government, and the strengthening of methods for evaluating and enforcing ideological discipline in state schools and workplaces.</p>
                        <p>In 2006, the Vento School was transferred from the administration of the Ministerio de la Industria Básica (MINBAS) to the Ministerio de Salud Pública (MINSAP) so that it could be redesigned to serve as a hospital for poor patients from Latin America seeking treatment in Cuba as part of Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's joint project, Operación Milagro.</p>
                        <p>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilich Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</p>

Los alumnos son estimulados a ejercer la crítica y la autocrítica y al ser requeridos para analizar sus respectivos deméritos, lo hacen saludando a la usanza militar. Se conoce que cada estudiante siempre lleva consigo una hoja de 'corte', en la cual se le anotan los reportes o faltas a la disciplina.</p>

                           <item>The Vento School was established in 1967 after Fidel Castro attended an awards ceremony held in Havana's Charlie Chaplin Theatre honoring the winners of nationwide competitions held at the local and provincial levels in writing, mathematics, and other disciplines. Admission to the school was highly selective and based on a combination of academic and political merit. The Vento School became the model for the prestigious Vladimir Ilich Lenin School, founded several years later for the very best students selected nationally at the secondary level.</item>

                     <p>Filmed at Ceballos, Ciego de Ávila Municipality, Ciego de Ávila Province (part of Camagüey province until 1975)</p>
                     <p>This work camp in Camagüey formed part of a larger project to recruit young able-bodied women for voluntary, unremunerated agricultural labor ("trabajo productivo") and to incorporate women whose participation in the informal economy had, until recently, kept them outside the ranks of the Revolution. According to Margarita Fonseca, the chief of the labor camp who is interviewed in original Reel 18, the idea of organizing and recruiting workers into the "Column of the Centenary" was the brainchild of Raúl Castro, who personally promoted the project in 1968 as a commemoration of the country's historical martyrs. Also according to Fonseca, by August 1969 when these films were made, 42,000 youths had been mobilized and were being housed at various labor camps throughout the province. Although it is not clear how long voluntary laborers were required to stay at the camps, those women whom the state had selected for political re-education through regimented, manual labor at the camps were committed for at least three years. Laborers in the camps were organized in military fashion into platoons and battalions headed by leaders of the Juventud Comunista.

                        <p>Film in color taken at the women's labor camp of the Columna Juvenil del Centenario (Youth Column of the Centenary of Cuban Independence,) comprised of a number of interrupted sequences. The scenes document the following activities:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Interview with a young woman militant of the Juventud Comunista who evaluates her own ability to lead.</item>
                           <item>Members of an all-female platoon practicing the Column's inspirational chant: "Nosotras las columnistas le decimos a Morón, que en el próximo chequeo obtendremos el cañón" ("We the columnists say to Morón that at the next inspection, we will maintain the cannon.") The chant refers to the town of Morón, which was the site of a similar work camp, and "maintaining the cannon," a symbol of the state's recognition of the superior productivity of this youth column over that of others at the time of the last inspection.</item>
                           <item>A young woman washing dishes during the lunch break.</item>
                           <item>Improvised recreational activity in which a black woman plays a rumba while a mulata soloist sings and is accompanied by other workers who serve as a chorus. The soloist sings two songs. The first song is a spontaneously conceived rumba that celebrates the gloriousness of "Fidel Castro Ruz," Communist dirigentes, and members of the Column for contributing to the Revolution. The second song is a standard romantic bolero common to Cuban cabaret acts of the 1950s.</item>
                           <item>A group of workers riding in the back of truck as they are driven to the fields for their daily labor. The women sing revolutionary songs of the period.</item>
                           <item>Group of columnists as they prepare to hoe and are inspected for their work.</item>
                           <item>Group of columnists who work in a carpentry shop. They are shown cutting spikes for use in the planting of orange saplings and other citrus crops. One of the women declares that they also do other types of related labor such as sanding, chopping firewood and crafting wood furniture. Another states that she has been working there for ten months.</item>
                           <item>Columnists hoeing in a field planted with orange trees.</item>
                           <item>Columnists playing volleyball in the camp grounds.</item>
                           <item>Columnists driving the small Italian-made tractors popularly known in Cuba as picolinos (by the company Goldoni) with which they work.</item>
                           <item>Recreation in which several young women parody the talk and singing of peasants in a competitive spirit, one pretending to be from the adjacent camp of Morón, the other a member of the Ceballos labor camp and defender of the "cannon."</item>
                           <item>As part of the government effort to liberate women through incorporation into the work force, the state had devised and promoted training programs for women to learn how to drive tractors. The program coincided with the importation of small tractors of Italian manufacture that became known as picolinos and popular logic tended to associate the size of the tractors with the gender of their presumed drivers, women.</item>

                        <p>Film in color that documents a political instruction class held at the all-female labor camp of the Columna Juvenil del Centenario. A teacher uses the diary of Ernesto "Che" Guevara during his failed guerrilla campaign in Bolivia to impart political lessons about heroism, hardship and history on the students. Recovered by unknown means by the Cuban government from the Bolivian military, El Diario del Che en Bolivia was published in Cuba and distributed freely around the world. The book became a key instructional guide for use in workers' study circles, meetings of mass organizations, and schools for politically advanced students like the Escuela Vocacional de Vento. In this film, the teacher's method is to ask the students interpretive questions in direct reference to passages in the book.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color taken of a nighttime assembly of the entire Column at which the chief leaders of the Juventud Comunista of the work camp preside. The purpose of the meeting is to elect the Column's most "exemplary workers" for promotion to the ranks of the Juventud Comunista. Nominations of candidates are followed by criticism and self-criticism, a method similarly employed in the disciplinary court documented in original Reel 13 at the Vento School. Such practices became standard at meetings of both the Juventud Comunista and the Communist Party in this period and are still maintained today. The assembly of sixty-one women is directed by the political instructor of the battalion (nicknamed "Política" by the women workers), an unidentified black woman whose family was affluent before 1959 and who is the subject of an interview documented in Film Reel #18. The walls of the assembly hall hold images of Che Guevara y Camilo Cienfuegos, as well as the color standard of the Cannon of the Centenary. At the beginning of the assembly, the leaders make clear that the successfully elected exemplary columnists will be "la cantera" (quarry) of the Juventud Comunista, also known as the Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (UJC). Also made clear is the fact that there is an urgent need for "cuadros" (political leaders) and higher-ranking "militantes" [militants] who will be in charge of the many tasks and plans developed for implementation in the province. During the course of the assembly, young women express their opinions about each candidate in terms of their work habits, popularity, political attitudes and general relationship to the rest of the group. Voting for the candidates is carried out through a public raising of hands and all votes, as officially declared by the Political Instructor, are recorded as unanimous. In the assembly, several young women can be seen smoking cigarettes.</p>
                        <p>As part of the government effort to liberate women through incorporation into the work force, the state had devised and promoted training programs for women to learn how to drive tractors. The program coincided with the importation of small tractors of Italian manufacture that became known as picolinos and popular logic tended to associate the size of the tractors with the gender of their presumed drivers, women. In the assembly, one of the young women who is nominated but not elected is harshly criticized for failing to stick with the tractor school [escuela de los picolinos], something which the Political Instructor insists is a priority recognized by the Comandante Fidel Castro and therefore of great importance to the development of the nation.</p>

                        <p>Película en colores tomada en una asamblea en el campamento femenino de la Columna Juvenil del Centenario en horario nocturno. La actividad está dirigida por la instructora política del batallón y participan 61 muchachas, de entre las cuales se seleccionan las columnistas ejemplares. En las paredes pueden observarse imágenes del Che Guevara y Camilo Cienfuegos y el gallardete del cañón del centenario.</p>
                        <p>Queda explícito que las columnistas ejemplares serán la cantera de la Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (UJC) y que la importancia de la actividad también radica en la necesidad de tener cuadros y militantes que dirijan las múltiples tareas de los planes que se desarrollan en la provincia.</p>
                        <p>En el desarrollo de la asamblea se hacen las proposiciones y las jóvenes emiten sus opiniones sobre dichas propuestas en relación a su actitud ante el colectivo, el trabajo y en el plano político. La aprobación se efectúa levantando el brazo y todas son votaciones unánimes.</p>
                        <p>En la asamblea pueden verse a algunas muchachas fumando cigarrillos.</p>

                        <list>
                           <item>Interrogation of Platoon No. 2 of the Column by the chief of the labor camp, Margarita Fonseca, during which she asks various members about the nature of the "requirements" they must fulfill in order to "maintain the cannon," that is, the rank of distinction for highest productivity in the province. In response, the young women explain that they fulfill their daily quotas, drink chlorinated water, dress correctly, adhere to disciplinary rules at work and in the dormitory, study daily, and attend political instruction classes twice a week [see Film Reel #16]. The women also refer to the fact that they are working in the national citric plan of the province and have prepared themselves for the election of exemplary workers in the battalion to the ranks of the Juventud Comunista.</item>
                           <item>Interview with Margarita Fonseca, who explains the history of the Columna Juvenil del Centenario since May 1968 when Raúl Castro announced it as a means for ensuring the success of the Ten Million Ton Harvest and solving the labor shortage problem in the province of Camagüey. Fonseca also refers to the concern that the youth be formed "integralmente," that is, not only in terms of productive labor, but also in terms of their political education, their cultural improvement and their general academic preparation. The object of the recruitment drive was originally set at 50,000 young people from all over Cuba, although 42,000 youth were already mobilized at the time for productive labor in the work camps. Fonseca also adds that the young women do not participate in harvesting sugar cane, but rather in producing citrus fruit and coffee and raising rabbits.</item>

                        <p>Film in color with no sound, taken at the all-female labor camp of the Columna Juvenil del Centenario during the course of an assembly held for the election of exemplary workers and their promotion to the Juventud Comunista. This film documents the second part of an assembly held the night before and recorded in original Reel 17. Apparently, discussion ran over the time allotted and a decision was made to continue the next morning. Although the assembly is held in the same facility, a much smaller number of women are in attendance, ostensibly because the rest could not put off the agricultural tasks they were required to complete that morning. Discussion is directed by the political instructor of the camp, an unidentified black woman whose family was affluent before 1959 and who is the subject of an interview documented in original Reel 18. Images of Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, as well as the color standard of the Cannon of the Centenary, are on the walls of the assembly hall. Although the discussion of the nominated candidate cannot be heard, voting on her candidacy results in a unanimous vote.</p>

                        <p>Film in color taken in the sugar cane district of Las Tunas province in which the Turcios Lima Brigade of voluntary workers was based. The film features the following scenes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The brigade during a lunch break taken in the same cane field where they are working. The workers are organized into military-style platoons and squadrons. The lunch, which a truck transported to the fields, consisted of beans, rice, roasted calabash, an unidentified food that appears to be some kind of meat, and fresh mangoes. Instrumental music can be heard in the distance. According to the announcer, the music is played by the orchestra of the Instituto Cubano de Radio y Televisión (ICRT) and is the work of Juan Almeida Bosque, a founding member of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement and the only black member of the Council of State.</item>
                           <item>The brigade enjoying a rest period from work under the shade of a peasant hut. Most of the cane cutters can be seen sharpening the blades of their shortened machetes (called mochas) while a recorded track sung by the Mexican singer Armando Manzanero can be heard in the distance. The laborers themselves begin to improvise verses to the rhythms of a Cuban guaracha. A member of the brigade reads and comments on an article titled "El compromiso de la Turcios Lima en la zafra…," ("The commitment of the Turcios Lima brigade to the Sugar Harvest"), which appeared in the magazine Combatiente. In the background, one can hear the cheer and rallying cry, "Los 10 millones van" ("The Ten Million Ton Harvest Goes!"). Later, the same workers are seen marching in line to work again in the cane fields, while some of them sing popular songs of the period.</item>
                           <item>The cane cutters in the act of cutting sugar cane as some of them tell jokes and sing songs.</item>
                           <item>The stockpiling center named "José Martí" where cane is shipped out for processing at the sugar mill after being chopped into smaller pieces and cleaned of all bagasse. Music promoting the Ten Million Ton Harvest can be heard in the distance.</item>
                           <item>Machine for gathering cut cane stalks as it loads up the back of a wheelbarrow being pulled by oxen.</item>

                        <p>Film in color taken in the sugar cane district of Las Tunas province where the voluntary work brigade named "Turcios Lima" contributed to the Ten Million Ton Harvest. Featured in the film are the following scenes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Outpouring of joy and celebration related to the announcement that the brigade had achieved the harvest of one million arrobas of cane. The arroba, equivalent to 11.5 kilograms, was the traditional measure of weight used in the rural areas of Cuba for harvesting all cultivated products, not just cane. The brigade was declared a "millionaire" for having achieved this distinction in productivity.</item>
                           <item>The brigade, now known as a Brigada de Avanzada, or front-line brigade (as in war), can be heard shouting the slogans,"Dándolo todo por los 10 millones" and "Brigada Roja del Millón" ("Giving it all for the Ten Million" and "The Red Brigade of the Million"). The cane cutters shout other slogans and "vivas" to the Revolution as they imbibe some type of liquid, probably rum, from a can. Later, they can be seen boarding the back of a wheelbarrow.</item>
                           <item>Joy and celebration expressed in a small group of houses stationed near the camp. "Vivas," or shouts of "Long live," can be heard with reference to the Commander in Chief (Fidel Castro), the Cuban Communist Party, all revolutionary movements throughout the world and the members of the brigade itself. A number of small gifts are presented to the workers: the Communist Pioneers award them a biography of Luís Augusto Turcios Lima, the brigade's namesake, and a floral bouquet, while a young female representative of the Federación de Mujeres Cubanas, or Federation of Cuban Women (better known as the FMC) gives a triangular-shaped flag to the most accomplished, oldest and highly productive worker, a man named Félix Pacheco. The flag is embroidered with the words "Delegación Mariana Grajales Caisimú." In the background, the song "Delilah" in Spanish by the English pop star Tom Jones can be heard. At the end of the ceremony, the workers board a wheelbarrow.</item>
                           <item>A musical group performs a song promoting the Ten Million Ton Harvest.</item>

                           <item>Júbilo y celebración de la brigada, relacionado con haber alcanzado su condición de millonaria (haber cortado un millón de arrobas de caña). Indistintamente se aprecian los términos de Brigada de Avanzada "Dándolo todo por los 10 millones" y "Brigada Roja del Millón". Los macheteros gritan consignas de vivas a la Revolución y comparten en una lata algún tipo de bebida. Posteriormente aparecen montando en una carreta.</item>
                           <item>Júbilo en un caserío, al parecer cercano al campamento, con vivas al Comandante en Jefe, al Partido Comunista de Cuba (PCC), a los movimientos revolucionarios del mundo y a la propia brigada; se le hacen varios obsequios a la brigada: los pioneros le entregan a un machetero destacado una biografía de Luís Augusto Turcios Lima y a otro un ramo de flores, mientras una joven de la Federación de Mujeres Cubanas (FMC) le entrega un gallardete al machetero más destacado, nombrado Félix Pacheco. En off se escucha una versión al español de la canción Delilah, del cantante inglés Tom Jones. Al finalizar la actividad montan en una carreta.</item>

                        <p>Film in color taken in the sugar cane district of Las Tunas province where the voluntary work brigade named "Turcios Lima" contributed to the Ten Million Ton Harvest. In this film, an assembly to select the best cane cutters takes place under the direction of a lieutenant of the Cuban army, or Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR). Featured are the following scenes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The lieutenant speaking to the cane cutters about the struggle in Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, who died that very day and whose death would be formally commemorated in Cuba with five days of mourning. As a result, there were no parties allowed despite the same brigade's recent triumph in reaching one million arrobas of cane cut.</item>
                           <item>The selection of the exemplary workers of the most recent two-week period. It begins with an introductory speech on the characteristics that participants should keep in mind when they consider different nominees, especially with regard to the skills and attitudes that fall in line with the model of the military that all voluntary agricultural workers are supposed to emulate. Two cane cutters comprising the same team, or duo, who cut 1200 arrobas on average per day are nominated. In addition to their productivity, other factors are also considered, such as their attitude toward work, their self-discipline while at work, on the street or in the camp, as well as their general disposition toward helping others after completing their own tasks. As the vote in favor of these candidates was unanimous, the credentials are presented to them. Second and third place were awarded to other nominated teams.</item>
                           <item>The workers' commitment to the brigade and the brigade's promise to cut seven million arrobas of cane are confirmed publicly. When asked by the attending official how long they think it will take them to cut another million, the workers respond that it will take somewhere between thirty and thirty-five days. The head of the brigade speaks of the possibility of surpassing that goal.</item>
                           <item>The magazine <emph render="italic">Combatiente</emph> is distributed. The edition includes an article about the brigade under the title, "Nuestra punta de vanguardia en la zafra gigante" ("Our Position as a Vanguard in the Giant Harvest").</item>
                           <item>The two officials from the FAR that spoke to the workers retire to their jeeps and drive away.</item>

                        <p>Película en colores tomada en la zona cañera en que labora la Brigada "Turcios Lima" donde se desarrolló una asamblea para escoger los mejores macheteros y que estuvo dirigida por un oficial de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR) con grado de teniente, donde puede apreciarse escenas de:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>El oficial dirigiéndose a los macheteros y hablando sobre la lucha de Vietnam y el Presidente Ho-Chi-Minh, muerto ese día, por lo que se habían declarado cinco días de duelo y por ello no habría festejos.</item>
                           <item>Selección de los mejores trabajadores en los últimos 15 días, con una introducción acerca de los elementos a tener en cuenta y el papel de los militares. Dos macheteros que promediaban 1200 arrobas diarias fueron seleccionados en primer lugar, aunque también se tuvo en cuenta su disciplina, actitud ante el trabajo, en el campamento, en la calle y su disposición siempre a ayudar a los demás después de terminar su tarea y al todos estar de acuerdo en su selección se les entregaron sus distintivos acreditativos. Posteriormente fueron seleccionados los dúos que ocuparon el segundo y tercer lugar.</item>
                           <item>Se expresa que el compromiso de la brigada es cortar siete millones de arrobas de caña. Al cuestionarse en qué tiempo podría la brigada cortar otro millón, responden que en 30 ó 35 días y el Jefe de la brigada habla de la posibilidad de sobrepasar esa meta.</item>
                           <item>Se reparten ejemplares de la revista Combatiente, donde aparece un artículo sobre la brigada titulado Nuestra punta de vanguardia en la zafra gigante.</item>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color that was taken in the central courtyard of the voluntary work brigade named "Turcios Lima," where a class or study circle of workers examine the theme, "Antecedentes del Ataque al Cuartel Moncad" ("Antecedents to the Attack on the Moncada Barracks"). The class is taught by an official of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR) who holds the rank of lieutenant. (The same official also appears in original Reel 23.) On a blackboard the following topics to be addressed appear:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The traditional political parties of pre-1959 Republic (then characterized in the official revolutionary idiom as the "República Mediatizada" or "Mediated Republic").</item>
                           <item>2. The coup d'etat carried out by Fulgencio Batista on 10 March 1952.</item>
                           <item>3. The masses began to comprehend against whom the coup d'etat was launched. (This is a reference to the state's official historical narrative that argued for a broadly symbolic interpretation of the coup's objective. That is, it was not simply against the democratically elected regime of then President Prío de Socarrás, but against the Republic itself and its many attendant contradictions and failings. The "masses" who realized this included Fidel Castro and his supporters who recognized that there was no going back to the former constitutional Republic and that a revolution was needed.)</item>
                           <item>4. The 26th of July opened a new era in Cuban history.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The officer makes specific reference to the following parties of the Republic: Auténtico, Liberal, Demócrata, Republicano, Conservador, Ortodoxo and the Partido Socialista Popular, or pre-1961 Communist Party. He also discusses the strikes, demonstrations, and other forms of popular protest against Batista. He states that the Catholic clergy had supported Batista. He also describes the historical context before the Revolution as one entirely determined by hunger, misery, illiteracy and no access to hospitals for the majority of Cuba's people. In particular, he illustrates the state of hunger and misery with printed pictures.</p>
                        <p>At one point, a sergeant intervenes in order to comment on the famous speech Fidel Castro made in his own defense at the time of his trial for his guerrilla group's attack on the Moncada military barracks on July 26, 1953. This sergeant cites the speech, titled "La Historia me absolverá," and describes the situation after the coup d'etat. Following this intervention, the lieutenant directing the session takes over again and describes the events subsequent to that date, dividing the auditorium in two parts in order to subject the groups to questions on that theme. The workers respond to the questions as best they can, although it is clear that they are limited by differing degrees of education and ease with public speaking.</p>

                           <item>2. El Golpe de Estado dado por Batista el 10 de marzo de 1952.</item>
                           <item>3. Una masa que empezaba a comprender contra quien da el Golpe de Estado.</item>
                           <item>4. El 26 de julio abre una nueva era en la Historia.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>El oficial se refiere a los partidos Auténtico, Liberal, Demócrata, Republicano, Conservador, Ortodoxo y al Partido Socialista Popular; a las manifestaciones de las masas y huelgas de trabajadores; el apoyo del clero a Batista; la situación de hambre, miseria (ilustrándolo con imágenes impresas), analfabetismo y acceso a los hospitales.</p>
                        <p>Interviene un sargento sobre el alegato de Fidel castro: La Historia me absolverá y la situación después del Golpe de Estado.</p>
                        <p>El oficial que dirige la actividad retoma la palabra y expone los acontecimientos que se sucedieron después del 26 de julio de 1953 y divide el auditorio en dos partes para hacer preguntas de control sobre el tema, las cuales son contestadas acorde al nivel de instrucción y facilidad de expresión.</p>

                        <p>Film in color made in the camp of the voluntary work brigade named "Turcios Lima" of an official ceremony honoring the brigade's achievement of having cut one million arrobas of sugar cane. Speeches by members of the brigade and a military official take place on the back of a wheelbarrow that serves as an improvised stage. The sound recording documents these successive events:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Someone introduces the act by recognizing the labor of the cane cutters and then proceeds to the presentation of the brigade's official award of distinction by the Commander Demetrio Monzeni Villa, chief of Central Command for the armed forces of Oriente.</item>
                           <item>The main speech is given by Miguel Plasencia, Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba for the region of Puerto Padre, who also extends a warm greeting from Guillermo García and the chief of the armed forces, Raúl Castro. He also proposes a moment of silence in honor of the recently deceased President Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam.</item>
                           <item>Plasencia focuses his speech on the brigade and the army, stating that the army struggles side-by-side with the people in the Harvest of the Ten Million Tons. He also favorably compares Cuba's army with those in the rest of Latin America, which he qualifies as largely parasitic and repressive. He also speaks of the need for anti-imperialist solidarity against the war in Vietnam, of the commitment of the brigade to cut seven million arrobas of cane, of the fact that already in that area the Ten Million Ton Harvest of 1970 has officially started and of his desire to see the workers "sew the sack that will seal the Ten Million Tons of sugar that has to be harvested." He also challenges them to the goal of beating another brigade named "Libertadores" and proposes carrying out a competition. He also remarks on the need to cut the cane according to the standard technique required to prevent loss of sugar from cutting the cane too far up the stalk and points out the terrible deficits that other brigades have suffered as a result. He ends his speech with the slogan, "Los 10 millones van, y de que van van," ("The Ten Million Tons Go!—And that they go, they go!").</item>
                           <item>Another intervention clarifies the fact that Miguel Plasencia is the "godfather" of the Brigada "Ferromocha" and that the real "godfather" of "Turcios Lima" brigade is Isidro Martínez, chief of Central Command for the Mobilization of the Cuban Communist Party in the region.</item>
                           <item>Against the backdrop of a song known as the "March of the Guerrilla," the cane cutters retire to their barracks.</item>

                        <p>Archivo sonoro grabado en el campamento de la Brigada "Turcios Lima" donde se desarrolló un acto oficial por el arribo de esta al millón de arrobas de caña cortadas y cuya tribuna fue improvisada sobre una carreta.</p>
                        <p>Alguien hace una introducción de reconocimiento a los macheteros y después se procede al abanderamiento a la brigada por el Comandante Demetrio Monzeni Villa, del Estado Mayor del Ejército Oriental.</p>
                        <p>El discurso central lo efectuó Miguel Plasencia, Secretario del Partido Comunista de Cuba en el Regional Puerto Padre, quien trasmitió un saludo de Guillermo García y el Jefe del Ejército y propuso hacer un minuto de silencio en honor al desaparecido Presidente Ho-Chi-Minh.</p>
                        <p>El orador hace referencias a la brigada y al ejército, al ejército junto al pueblo en la zafra y compara el ejército de Cuba con los demás de América Latina; habla sobre la solidaridad antiimperialista y contra la guerra de Vietnam; al compromiso de la brigada de cortar hasta 7 millones de arrobas de caña; al hecho que en esa región comenzó la zafra del 70 y allí se debía coser el saco que selle los 10 millones de toneladas de azúcar; al reto que hace otra brigada nombrada "Libertadores", con la que propone efectuar una competencia; a las normas técnicas del corte, alza, etc. y a brigadas que han tenido pérdidas elevadas. Culmina el discurso con la consigna: "Los 10 millones van, y de que van van".</p>
                        <p>Otra intervención aclarando que Miguel Plasencia es padrino de la Brigada "Ferromocha" y de la "Turcios Lima" lo es Isidro Martínez, Jefe del Estado Mayor de Movilización del PCC en la región.</p>
                        <p>Con las notas de la marcha del guerrillero se retiran los macheteros hacia los albergues.</p>

                        <p>Film in color, shot in fragmented sequences, taken in the courtyard of a campground where the voluntary labor brigade "Turcios Lima" is housed in barracks-style buildings. The film records a group interview in which seven members of the brigade provide information about their social backgrounds prior to the Revolution, the moment when their consciousness was raised in favor of struggle against the dictatorship of Batista, and their subsequent activities. The conversation focuses on the following:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>Their families' social backgrounds (most of them are of peasant extraction) and the age at which they began to work in support of their families. Some of the men are from the sugar mill Estrada Palma (re-named "Bartolomé Masó" by the state after the Revolution, in the province known after 1975 as Granma). One of the men, Félix Pacheco, is from Guantánamo.</item>
                           <item>The moment in which some of them join the struggle against the dictator, experience a change of consciousness, or enter into the revolutionary underground in support of urban and guerrilla fighters. Some attest to the execution by firing squad or torture of friends and family members by Batista's security forces.</item>
                           <item>Poverty in the area in which they lived and the low scholastic level they achieved as a result. They also note their work after the triumph of the Revolution to combat these social ills.</item>
                           <item>The composition of the brigade: long-term professional cane cutters; recruits serving military duty required of all young men in Cuba after 1961; and some officials of the FAR, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba.</item>
                           <item>Their future aspirations.</item>
                           <item>In general, they all feel as if they have achieved very little so far and have much to do in the future.</item>

                           <item>Momento en que algunos de ellos se incorpora a la lucha contra la dictadura de batista, toman conciencia o entran a la clandestinidad. Algunos hacen referencia a fusilados y torturas a familiares y amigos.</item>
                           <item>La pobreza en que vivían y el nivel de escolaridad que habían alcanzado, así como su labor posterior al triunfo de la Revolución.</item>

                        <p>Film in color, taken of a conversation between mill workers and students from the University of Oriente, who are there carrying out their practical training. Workers respond to a number of students' questions. These questions deal with the following themes:</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>The payment of overtime and the workers' attitude toward the Revolution's new policy of eliminating overtime in exchange for guaranteed, year-round work and the idea of working for moral incentives and the development of society rather than individual, monetary reasons.</item>
                           <item>The incorporation of workers into civil defense militias at the beginning of the Revolution as a result of the need to organize the people to confront foreign aggression; the creation of the militias, workers' responsibility for cleaning and maintaining workplaces and the need for workers to serve on guard duty at their work site.</item>
                           <item>The need to eradicate absenteeism. In this context, it becomes clear that the majority of the students were graduated from technical institutions and are also demobilized former soldiers of the armed forces, or FAR.</item>
                           <item>The Ten Million Ton Harvest and the importance that workers should give to discipline, attendance at work, etc.</item>
                           <item>The attitude of the forty-eight young people who have completed training at the Escuela Técnica Azucarera in order to be able to operate machinery newly imported from foreign countries.</item>
                           <item>The eradication of the habits of arriving late to work and of working slowly during the regular work day; also the problem of those who leave early and the existence of the Consejo de Justicia Laboral, or labor supervisory council charged with punishing workers for failings in their work discipline.</item>
                           <item>At the end of the meeting, the students and workers confirm their mutual desire to work together and a student who has been leading the session says farewell on behalf of the Communist youth. The film ends with images of the sugar mill and its four smokestacks with the following words painted on them: "San Germán," (the mill's pre-revolutionary name), "Urbano Noris" and the slogan "10 Millones Van." The last scene in the film shows a political study circle of the students.</item>

                           <item>El cobro de las horas extra y la actitud de renunciar a ello por las garantías que tienen de la revolución, de trabajo durante todo el año y no trabajar por dinero sino por el desarrollo de la sociedad.</item>
                           <item>La incorporación de los trabajadores a la Defensa civil a raíz del triunfo de la Revolución, por la necesidad de organizar al pueblo ante las agresiones; la creación de las milicias; el cuidado de los centros de trabajo; la guardia obrera, etc.</item>
                           <item>La asistencia al trabajo y la erradicación del ausentismo. Se conoce que la mayoría de los jóvenes son graduados de institutos tecnológicos y desmovilizados de las FAR.</item>
                           <item>La zafra de los 10 Millones y la importancia que dan los obreros a la disciplina, asistencia, etc.</item>
                           <item>La actitud de los 48 jóvenes que se han preparado en la Escuela Técnica Azucarera para operar los equipos de procedencia extranjera.</item>
                           <item>La erradicación de las llegadas tarde o poco aprovechamiento de la jornada laboral, o irse antes de tiempo y que para combatirlo existe un Consejo de Justicia Laboral.</item>
                           <item>Acuerdan estrechar y trabajar conjuntamente y un estudiante se despide en nombre de la juventud comunista.</item>
                           <item>Se obsaervan imágenes del central con sus cuatro chimeneas, tres de ellas rotuladas: "San Germán", "Urbano Noris" y "10 Millones Van".</item>

                        <p>Film in color, taken during a group meeting of the council of leaders of the Juventud Comunista of the "Urbano Noris" sugar mill and the students of the University of Oriente in order to evaluate the work they have done so far and their outlook for the future. In the meeting, participants talk about their attitude toward work and their political duties; their need to form an "integrated" youth with the proper consciousness; the execution of sports and cultural events in order to propagandize the Communist Youth. It is stated that labor carried out in the area of cane weighing and processing has been good and that only the part of the process, in which the sugar is refined ("los turbos"), has yet to be dealt with; that the university students must be more involved in the areas of the mill over which the Juventud Comunista exercises little control, given the lack of interest among workers in continuing their studies, the number of workers who have not achieved sixth grade levels of education, and others who should begin the Secondary School for Workers and Peasants (Secundaria Obrero Campesina, or SOC).</p>
                        <p>Additionally, participants discuss the degrees of technical training achieved among the workers and the challenge of incorporating the workers into classes despite the fact that the mill provided facilities for them to study during their regular work hours. Based on these concerns, the young Communists and students make a number of proposals. On the one hand, they will mobilize the workers for six hours of voluntary labor in agriculture on Sunday and follow this up with a party at which they will have the opportunity to carry out political propaganda. On the other hand, they will organize political study circles ("círculos politicos") to discuss the life and death of Che Guevara among workers and students involved in the building of the thermoelectric plant. Participants will be split into groups according to their shifts that will compete with one another to show which group does a better job of participating and showing their commitment to the material being discussed. According to the revolutionary idiom of the day, this process is called "emular por turnos de trabajo."</p>

                        <p>Película en colores, tomada durante reunión conjunta de los buroes de la UJC del central y de los estudiantes de la Universidad de Oriente, para chequear el trabajo realizado y las perspectivas futuras.</p>
                        <p>Se habla sobre la actitud ante el trabajo y las tareas políticas; de cómo formar un joven integral; la ejecución de actividades deportivas y culturales para propagandizar las actividades de la juventud. Se plantea que el trabajo en el área del vasculador y la caldera ha sido buena y quedaría el de los "turbos", sobre haber mayor vínculo de los universitarios en áreas de poco control por la UJC, pues hay dificultades con la continuidad de estudios, otros que no alcanzan el sexto grado y otros deben comenzar la Secundaria Obrero Campesina (SOC), en la capacitación en conocimientos técnicos y sobre las dificultades en la incorporación a las clases a pesar de que el central había dado facilidades para que los obreros se capaciten durante la jornada laboral.</p>
                        <p>Se hacen propuestas: por un lado para una movilización de seis horas a la agricultura un domingo y en la noche hacer una fiesta, la cual se aprovechará para hacer propaganda y por otro lado para hacer círculos políticos sobre la caída del Che Guevara y su vida, donde participen obreros y estudiantes y en la construcción de la termoeléctrica, emular por turnos de trabajo.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color, taken during a conversation between a mechanical engineer named Otto and five students from the University of Oriente, in which aspects of their families' social and class background before the Revolution are revealed, as well as the impact that the Revolution had on them. The engineer narrates his participation in student protests, his lack of knowledge of what socialism was and his tendency to feel insulted whenever someone would call him a Communist during the pre-1959 revolutionary struggle. (During the Batista regime, supporters of Batista and Batista himself had characterized any opponent or critic of the dictatorship as a Communist.)</p>
                        <p>The engineer tells of his integration into the 26th of July Movement in Santiago de Cuba, participation in the defense of the Bay of Pigs at the time of the CIA-led invasion, his work in Pinar del Rio province and his return to formal study after the triumph of the Revolution.</p>
                        <p>The university students reveal that they are the children of bus drivers, peasants and, in one case, a father who abandoned his responsibilities and his family. They also attest to the difficulties that people encountered when they wanted to study before 1959 or even work because of the lack of jobs. One talks about how he became a member of a revolutionary militia and the sense that he was living in a unique historical moment by participating in the Ten Million Ton Harvest. He also notes that his work in the harvest makes up for his being unable to defend his country militarily in war having missed his chance (in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion). The discussants also talk about the contradiction between having Catholic religious beliefs and participating in the everyday activities associated with revolutionary life.</p>

                        <p>Película en colores, tomada durante un conversatorio entre un ingeniero mecánico nombrado Otto y cinco estudiantes de la Universidad de Oriente, donde exponen aspectos relacionados con su extracción social y estatus de sus familias antes del triunfo de la Revolución y los cambios que tuvieron después de aquel acontecimiento.</p>
                        <p>El ingeniero narra su participación en protestas estudiantiles, su desconocimiento de lo que era el socialismo y su ofensa en una ocasión que le llamaron comunista; su incorporación al movimiento 26 de julio en Santiago de Cuba, participación en Playa Girón, trabajos en Pinar del Río y la continuación de sus estudios después del triunfo de la Revolución.</p>
                        <p>Los estudiantes universitarios manifiestan ser hijos de chofer, campesinos e incluso uno de ellos abandonado por su padre, las dificultades para poder estudiar anteriormente, algunos dedicarse a trabajar y uno expone haberse incorporado a las milicias y estar en una oportunidad histórica, al participar en la zafra de los 10 millones, al no haber podido ir a la guerra.</p>
                        <p>En otro momento se habla de contradicciones con la religión católica y participación en otras actividades en la etapa revolucionaria vivida.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color, taken in a series of fragmented sequences that were shot in the sugar cane district during the building of a Círculo Social Campesino, or social club for peasants, and a small children's park. A number of orientadores rurales, peasants charged by the state with the task of giving political and ideological instruction to other peasants about the positive ends of state policies, participated in the construction.</p>
                        <p>During the film one ideological instructor, or orientador rural, is interviewed and he comments on the conditions of the area before the triumph of the Revolution, saying that it was very isolated, with impassable footpaths that have now been replaced with dirt roads. He also explains that they are building a Círculo Social in order to carry out cultural activities for the workers and peasants for their entertainment, including the viewing of films, as well as a park for the recreation of the children. At the same time, they are also building houses for the workers and peasants by relying on their own labor and resources in the zone. The work is done after their regular work day has ended. Other themes the orientador rural discusses include women's contributions to productive labor, children's attendance rates at local state schools, and the interest among peasants to "superarse" (that is, improve themselves) by reading, etc.</p>
                        <p>The film also provides images of workers in the construction process; an oxen-pulled cart; children playing; a worker pointing out where the Mariel port is in relation to Artemisa, Havana and the city of Pinar del Rio; fields of cane and royal palm trees; a peasant riding a horse; a song being played in the background while a truck carries furniture for a move, with the designation Transporte Agropecuario Habana; and a recreational event or party that includes a piñata.</p>

                        <p>Un orientador es entrevistado y expone las condiciones de la zona antes del triunfo de la Revolución, aislada, con caminos intransitables ahora sustituidos por terraplenes; expresa que se encuentran construyendo un Círculo Social para efectuar actividades culturales a obreros y campesinos, para su distracción, proyección de películas, etc. y un parque infantil para la recreación de los niños; también se han construido casas para los campesinos y obreros con su propio esfuerzo y recursos de la zona, con la ayuda de todos después de la jornada de trabajo; el aporte de las mujeres; la asistencia de los niños a clases; el interés de los campesinos por superarse en círculos de lectura; etc. Pueden apreciarse tomas de los trabajadores en plena faena constructiva, carreta tirada por bueyes, niños jugando, un trabajador señalando las direcciones hacia donde queda el Mariel, Artemisa, La Habana y Pinar del Río; un paisaje con cañaverales y palmas reales; un campesino a caballo; una canción en off de los años 60; un camión con la identificación de Transporte Agropecuario Habana con muebles encima y al lado, al parecer por una mudanza, una actividad recreativa que incluye piñata, etc.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color taken in two different locations in which orientadores rurales, or peasants charged by the state with the official political and ideological instruction of other peasants, are featured in a day-long house-raising event in which the extended family and others participate. Among the tasks filmed is the thatching of a roof with palm leaves on a small wooden house or bohío and a voluntary labor campaign on a Sunday (normally the workers' only day off) to plant sugar cane. In the first case, peasants can be seen in the roofing of the bohíos, a task in which they are also helped by a woman in the interior of the home and several small children who bring water to the home from a nearby well or other source. A peasant is interviewed and conveys that before, such a task would have involved the work of the extended family and other very close relations and neighbors. Today, he asserts, the task involves the work "of all" and repeats official slogans promoted by state organs among the peasants in that period such as, "Ahora todos somos familia" ("Today all of us are family") and "La revolución es el apellido de uno" ("The Revolution is the surname of each of us.") He also claims that worker and peasant brigades labor in agriculture in a segregated manner, but that in some cases they are able to work together. He further refers to the education of the children and how a school house was built with the cooperation of workers and peasants and that the same school is "godfathered" by a group of industrial workers (see Notes). Scenes related to Sunday voluntary labor include cane fields and other fields where workers carry out tasks related to planting, while music from a speaker placed on top of a car is heard in the background.</p>
                        <p>During the Revolution's socialist age (post 1961), state agencies often named certain industrial unions or branches of the military to serve as ideological and technical "padrinos," literally "godfathers," to brigades of volunteer workers (such as those featured in the Turcios Lima group of films) or peasants who were considered to have lower degrees of revolutionary consciousness and socialist indoctrination. The policy built on long-standing cultural practices in the rural areas in which peasants and even slaves would name individuals of a higher social rank and educational status as the godparents of their children. The practice was a mechanism of social defense that, or so parents hoped, would serve them in case of a family emergency such as illness, trouble with the law or sudden decline of financial solubility due to unforeseen circumstances. After the Revolution, the terminology and the practice was incorporated as part of the state's efforts to convince peasants that they should support the Revolution and not feel intimidated or alienated by its policies. At the same time, it was hoped that individual representatives of the organizations declared "godfathers" would serve as intermediaries between the state and the people, serving to reduce and eliminate any tensions that might arise and might impede the successful completion of labor quotas set by the state.

                        <p>Película en colores, tomada en dos locaciones diferentes donde participan orientadores rurales: una jornada en que varios campesinos se encuentran cobijando (poner techo de guano) una casa de madera o bohío y durante una movilización dominical de trabajo voluntario en la siembra de caña.</p>
                        <p>En el primer caso se observan los campesinos en la ejecución del techado del bohío, donde ayudan también una mujer en el interior y unos niños que traen el agua desde otro lugar cercano.</p>
                        <p>Un campesino es entrevistado, quien se refiere a como se hacía esa actividad anteriormente sólo entre miembros de la familia y vecinos muy allegados y ahora colaboraban todos –frases: "Ahora todos somos familia" y "La revolución es el apellido de uno"- ; que en la agricultura trabajan brigadas de obreros y campesinos por separado, pero en determinadas ocasiones trabajan juntos; a la educación de los niños; de cómo se construyó la escuela en el lugar entre obreros y campesinos y que está apadrinada por obreros industriales.</p>
                        <p>En el segundo caso aparecen campos sembrados de caña y otros donde los trabajadores están efectuando la siembra, mientras se escucha por los altoparlantes colocados encima de un auto unas veces a la emisora Radio Reloj y otras música.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color, taken during party immediately following a political ceremony in which a number of peasants were named as having achieved vanguard status for showing through their labors and attitude the emergence of a revolutionary consciousness. The phrase used in the official idiom of the time to describe such workers was "campesinos de avanzada." The party takes place in the Círculo Social Campesino recently constructed and named "Camilo Cienfuegos." One can also see the recently finished children's park, named El Lobito (the Little Wolf). A number of signs and posters can be seen that read: "Saludamos la presentación de los Campesinos de Avanzada. ANAP Costa Norte" ("The Association of Small Farmers of the Northern Coast Salutes the Peasants of the Vanguard") and "Un 28 a la altura de los 10 millones" ("A 28th Worthy of the Ten Millions"). Note that the "28th" refers to the anniversary of the founding of neighborhood watch groups meant to root out counterrevolutionaries and internal enemies of the Revolution on September 28, 1961. Ever since then, the date became a national celebration of these committees, called Comités de Defensa de la Revolución, or CDRs. Behind the stage where the political ceremony took place is an image of El Che and a number of phrases attributed to, or about him, such as "Quien abre el camino campo de vanguardia, los mejores entre los buenos" ("Whoever opens the path, field of the vanguard, the best among the good"); "El Partido" ("The Party"); and "Che."</p>
                        <p>In other shots, workers, peasants and their families drink beer and relax in the areas outside the social club. Inside, a peasant band enlivens the party with four peasant singers who improvise the lyrics to the music and engage in the traditional back-and-forth bantering style typical of peasant popular expression in Cuba and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean more generally. The themes discussed by the poet-singers include the peasant vanguard; the personal attributes of the singers themselves; the filmmakers, whom the singers characterize as "los visitantes de la tierra de Lincoln el leñador" ("the visitors from the Land of Lincoln the Wood-Cutter"); the relative qualities of beets versus cane sugar; Ernest Hemingway; the legendary Indian chief, known as Hatuey, who resisted Spanish colonialism; the American "eagle" as a representation of imperialism; Cuba's independence struggle; Fidel and the struggle in the Sierra Maestra; the "blonde Empire" and the much-coveted wealth of Cuba; the CIA-directed invasion at Playa Girón (Bay of Pigs); the "boyfriends of money"; true patriots; etc.</p>

                        <p>Film in color, shot during the course of a group interview with orientadores rurales, set in the middle of a field. They describe their experiences prior to the Revolution and afterwards, noting their previous employment and scholastic levels before being recruited for training in the state's program for orientadores rurales.

They also narrate their experiences of living in the midst of peasants and their sense of satisfaction with their job performance.</p>

                        <p>Summary (English)</p>
                        <p>Film in color documenting a political awards ceremony in which high-ranking members of the provincial and regional Communist Party award 106 selected peasants the title of "campesinos de avanzada," or vanguard. The ceremony precedes a cultural activity to celebrate the peasants' selection; both are attended by a diverse spectrum of working-class and peasant community members, including family members and children who wear the grade-school uniform of the Communist Pioneers. The act takes place in an area adjacent to the recently built Círculo Social Campesino "Camilo Cienfuegos," or peasant social club. On stage, an image of Ché Guevara and a poster with one of his sayings, as well as a Cuban flag and other banners of various colors can be seen. The sound recording documents the ceremony, which is presided over by Manolo González, Provincial Organizer of the state mass organization for small peasant farmers known as ANAP, Asociación Nacional de Agricultores Pequeños; Galán (no first name given), Second Secretary of the Regional Bureau of the Cuban Communist Party; Francisco Reyes, Director of Central Planning for the Northern Coas; Mireya Rodríguez, representative of the Regional Bureau of the mass women's organization known as the FMC, Federación de Mujeres Cubanas; and other political leaders of ANAP and the state collective farms in the cane zones dominated by salaried workers.</p>
                        <p>The primary speaker refers to the following themes and topics:</p>
                        <list>

                              <emph render="italic">Note:</emph> The "Cannon of the Centenary" was a title given to those voluntary labor brigades whose productivity met and/or surpassed government-set goals for that particular year, 1968. In that year, Cuba celebrated the one-hundred-year anniversary of its first movement for independence and the abolition of slavery, launched by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes on October 10, 1868. During the period from 1967 to 1970, known as the "Revolutionary Offensive," the state mobilized more citizens for voluntary, unpaid labor in agriculture than before or after. Workers were housed in large labor camps with all their basic needs met by the government. The camps were generally in Camagüey province in the far eastern part of the country. Camagüey had been devoted to cattle ranching previous to the 1959 Revolution; after 1965, state planners attempted to develop sugar cane production despite the generally limited population and labor shortage in the zone. The system of highly militarized labor camps overseen by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias, headed by Raúl Castro, included a number of camps set up in the early years of the Revolution (such as Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producción) where citizens were detained and "re-educated" through coercive forms of manual/agricultural work known in the revolutionary lexicon as "productive labor." After 1967, volunteer labor brigades such as the Youth Column of the Centenary (the subject of original Reels 15-20) were comprised of women who had individually responded to the state's massive publicity campaign to recruit volunteers for three month stints, as well as women whose continuing participation in informal and illicit sectors of the economy (such as free-lance prostitution, petty-gambling rings and underground cabarets and bars) made them targets for re-education in the values and consciousness of the Revolution. One brigade which received the title was the Youth Column of the Centenary. The designation of a work brigade or column as having received the "Cannon of the Centenary" did not come with any form of material reward but merely a symbolic recognition and the presentation of a flag bearing the icon of a cannon to the brigade in a political ceremony. This flag is displayed prominently at the front of the workers' assembly for the election of exemplary columnists in original Reels 17 and 20.</item>

                        <p>Archival sound recording in which a group of four peasant improvisational poets spontaneously compose and sing verses commenting on the visit of the filmmakers; Cuba's national heroes and their contribution to the legends and myths of a Cuban nationality based on rebellion; justice; and nonconformity. Three men and one woman accompany a musical group of fellow peasants who play at the cultural event sponsored by the government to celebrate the selection of 106 peasants for the title of "vanguard." The event takes place at the recently inaugurated peasant social club known as the Círculo Social Campesino "Camilo Cienfuegos." The themes discussed among the poet-singers have to do with the peasant vanguard; the personal attributes of the singers themselves; the filmmakers whom the singers characterize as "los visitantes de la tierra de Lincoln el leñador" ("the visitors from the Land of Lincoln the Wood-Cutter"); the relative qualities of beet versus cane sugar; Ernest Hemingway; the legendary Indian chief, known as Hatuey, who resisted Spanish colonialism; the American "eagle" as a representation of imperialism; Cuba's independence struggle; Fidel and the struggle in the Sierra Maestra; the "blonde Empire" and the much-coveted wealth of Cuba; the CIA-directed invasion at Playa Girón (Bay of Pigs); the "boyfriends of money;" true patriots; etc. See also original Reel 38.</p>

                        <p>Archivo sonoro donde se improvisan tonadas y controversias por parte de cuatro poetas (tres hombres y una mujer) y un conjunto de música campesina. Constituye parte orgánica con la película No. 38, en la celebración de una fiesta después de un acto político donde se presentaron 106 campesinos de avanzada en el Círculo Social Campesino "Camilo Cienfuegos", recién inaugurado.</p>
                        <p>Las controversias interpretadas giran en torno a los campesinos de avanzada, a las aptitudes personales de los poetas, a la Revolución, a los "visitantes de la tierra de Lincoln el leñador" –refiriéndose a los cineastas que filman-, así como motivos entre la remolacha y la caña, Hemingway y el indio Hatuey, el "águila" americana y la independencia, Fidel y la Sierra Maestra, el imperio "rubio" y las pretendidas riquezas cubanas, Girón, los "novios del dinero", los patriotas, etc.</p>

                     <p>Black and white film, shot during the course of an interview conducted by "Lisa," a blonde Canadian reporter of the CBC, with the assistance of an unnamed official Cuban translator who does not appear on camera. Lisa interviews three cabaret performers, all of whom respond to questions related to the changing nature of the public who attend their shows since the triumph of the Revolution and their political convictions. In particular, Lisa asks the performers if they are Communists and what their views of Fidel Castro are. The film cuts off the third subject of the interview before she has a chance to make her statements.</p>

                     <p>Summary (English)</p>
                     <p>Filmed in Havana and Santiago de Cuba (La Habana y Santiago de Cuba).</p>
                     <p>Black and white film shot during an inspection tour by Comandante Fidel Castro of an all-boys' school in the capital that specializes in studies related to cattle breeding. Also included is an interview with Olga Guevara Pérez (died in 1986), a female guerrilla who saw combat duty in Fidel Castro's column during the war in the Sierra Maestra against Batista in the late 1950s. A first lieutenant in the revolutionary armed forces at the time of the interview, Guevara appears on the road under construction that will eventually lead to the "Gran Piedra" in Santiago de Cuba.</p>
                     <p>During his visit to the boys' school, Fidel responds to questions from a CBC reporter named Lisa in English and Spanish, with the help of translator, and answers questions related to the development and results of intensive methods for the breeding, raising and milking of cattle. He explains that there are nearly 1,200 students in the school, and another 300 studying medicine in the avicultural school (that is, a school devoted to the study of chicken-farming). Fidel talks with the students about boats that have been captured by the United States (four fishing vessels and thirty-eight men were captured by the United States Coast Guard on February 3, 1964, and returned to Cuba on February 20, 1964). He also laughs with a blonde journalist named Lisa and the students about the journalist's attractive female qualities.</p>
                     <p>The interview with first lieutenant Olga Guevara Pérez takes place alongside the mountain road under construction, overlooking the valley below. During the interview, Guevara Pérez responds to questions about her life in the rebel army and the Sierra Maestra and the rustic conditions encountered by the rebels and harassment by Batista's army. She also talks about politics under the Revolution, especially with regard to Fidel; about leaders who refused to endorse Communism before the Revolution and then did so afterward; the struggle in the mountains and the cities today; her opinion of Fidel and if she has ever felt deceived; her certainty that the guerrillas would triumph eventually; and the peculiar challenges encountered by women in the Sierra, especially regarding the uniform and the need for feminine clothing.</p>

                     <p>Película en blanco y negro, tomada durante un recorrido del Comandante Fidel Castro por escuela al oeste de la capital cuyos estudios están relacionados con la ganadería y una entrevista a la combatiente del Ejército Rebelde y entonces Primer Teniente Olga Guevara Pérez (fallecida en 1986), en la carretera en construcción a la Gran Piedra en Santiago de Cuba.</p>
                     <p>En la visita a la escuela de alumnos varones, Fidel responde a la entrevistadora en idioma inglés y español los cuestionamientos acerca de la ganadería intensiva y sus rendimientos; además expresa que cerca de allí hay 1200 alumnos estudiando medicina y 300 en una escuela de Avicultura.</p>
                     <p>En otras escenas aparece Fidel dialogando con los estudiantes acerca de unos barcos capturados por los norteamericanos y bromeando con la periodista y los estudiantes y aparece una periodista, al parecer norteamericana, nombrada Lisa, motivo de una broma de Fidel.</p>
                     <p>La entrevista a la Primer Teniente Olga Guevara Pérez, se desarrolla a un lado de la carretera en construcción y responde a preguntas relacionadas con su vida en el Ejército Rebelde y en la Sierra Maestra, las condiciones naturales y el hostigamiento del ejército de Batista; sobre lo que les hablaban de política, especialmente Fidel; sobre los líderes antes no declarados comunistas y si después del triunfo de la revolución; la lucha en las montañas y en las ciudades ahora; su opinión sobre Fidel y si ha tenido desengaños; su seguridad siempre en el triunfo; las dificultades de las mujeres en la Sierra Maestra y sobre el uniforme y la ropa femenina.</p>
                     <p>Los barcos capturados a que se refiere aquí es a 4 buques de pesca con 38 tripulantes ocurrida el 3 de febrero de 1964 y que regresaron el día 20 de ese mismo mes.</p>

                     <p>Summary (English)</p>
                     <p>Filmed at Municipality of Playa, province of the City of Havana (Municipio Playa, Provincia Ciudad de La Habana).</p>
                     <p>Film shot in black and white, taken in different locations to the west of the capital city of Havana and featuring interviews conducted with children belonging to the state's educational program of the Dirección Nacional de Becas (DNB). This was the national directorate that coordinated boarding schools, both in the city and in rural areas, for the education of children with minimal interference by and participation of parents. The purpose of such schools was to create "the New Man" whose consciousness and identity reflected the values of a socialist society as defined by the post-1959 revolutionary state. In this film, an unidentified blonde Canadian reporter of the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) speaks to the children in English and is seen preparing herself for an interview with what she calls "anti-Castro Cubans."</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>Interview in English with three students (one girl and two boys), apparently of middle-school age, in the courtyard of a school. During the interview, the students respond to questions about the significance of the Revolution, their future career aspirations and feelings about Fidel Castro.</item>
                        <item>Preparatory takes in which a reporter and her film crew film her as she asks questions of "anti-Castro Cubans" whom, presumably, she later interviews. The reporter states her questions dramatically, asks leading follow-ups as if she already anticipates the answers to her questions and pauses as if she is listening to a reply that the film crew will later insert into an edited final clip.</item>
                        <item>Scenes of students from a boarding school located in Miramar as they march from their dormitories (converted from the mansions once belonging to Cuba's exiled millionaires) down 5th Avenue in that district, using military style steps and chanting allegorical slogans of the Revolution. The most audible of these slogans is "Socialismo, Comunismo, Revolución"; another concerns the children's unconditional support for Fidel Castro's orders regardless of where they may be ("dónde sea"); and older students of high school age sing the communist hymn known as the "The International."</item>
                        <item>Students of the national directorate of revolutionary boarding schools, or Dirección Nacional de Becas (DNB), were housed in mansions expropriated or abandoned by their owners, most of whom left for the United States in 1959 and 1960. These mansions were largely located in the exclusive district of Miramar. The schools pertaining to DNB in the area had the following names: "Carlos Marx," "Manuel Bisbé," "Heroes de Yaguajay," "Rubén Martínez Villena," and "Antón Makarenko." All of them are located in what is now known as the municipality of Playa.</item>

The film is shot largely from the vantage point of a bus stop. Among the sites documented is a store from the period of Cuba's transition from United States-dominated capitalism to Soviet-directed Communism. The storefront identifies its merchandise with a sign: "Distribuidora de Piezas Capitalistas" ("Distributor of Capitalist Parts"), referring to the sale of spare parts for the repair of Cuba's largely United States-manufactured durable goods.</item>

                     <list>
                        <item>Most of the landmark areas of the city taken from the balcony of the hotel Habana Libre, known as the Havana Hilton and owned by Conrad Hilton before it was nationalized by the Revolution in 1960. Among the areas shown are Vedado, where the hotel is located; Centro Habana; and street scenes of the strip known as La Rampa that runs perpendicular to the Hotel, from the corner of 23rd and L streets to the Malecón, or sea wall.</item>
                        <item>Scenes of Vedado, taken from the seat of a car as it drives along the Malecón.</item>
                        <item>Street scenes of Old Havana taken on Havana, Obispo and Aguiar streets.</item>
                        <item>The interiors of the United States-owned Woolworth's, the five-and-dime store once located at the intersection of Galiano Street and San Rafael Boulevard in Centro Habana, and the Cuban-owned dime store, La Época, located at the corner of Galiano and Neptuno. La Época was reopened in 1997 by the Communist government as a retailer selling products for a government-issued form of hard currency based on the United States dollar. These products were largely manufactured in capitalist joint venture plants owned by the state and foreign investors. The old Woolworth store remains a state store that sells very poor quality materials and secondhand clothing for Cuban pesos (the official national currency with which the state pays Cubans employed in the Communist sector of the economy and which is not exchangeable on the international market).</item>

The street corner is noteworthy for being the place where the famously posh department store called El Encanto was destroyed and set ablaze by counterrevolutionary arsonists (possibly under the employment of the store's private owners on April 13, 1961, six days before the Bay of Pigs Invasion). The resulting open space where the store once stood was made into a park named for the employee who died in the blaze and subsequently became a revolutionary martyr, Fe del Valle.</item>

                     <p>Summary (English)</p>
                     <p>Filmed in Havana Province (Provincia Ciudad de La Habana).</p>
                     <p>Black and white film taken in various locations of the military zone marked Unidad C-19 "Rubén Martínez Villena." Female students of the Ana Betancourt school, created by the revolutionary government for the education of peasant women, can be seen, as well as a daycare center, possibly for their children. The entrance to the military zone is guarded by an armed soldier and the grounds of the school located within the zone are both extensive and filled with trees, dense foliage and a number of buildings that serve as a dining room, dormitories, classrooms, and workshops. Several of the female students engage in diverse activities such as marching in military style, participating in a ceremony for the raising of the Cuban flag, and sitting in a classroom as they receive instruction. In addition, the film features views of a workshop where the students engage in the principal vocation for which the Ana Betancourt system was founded, that is, the cutting, sewing and tailoring of clothes. The sewing machines visible in the workshop are all from United States-manufacturer Singer. The final images of the film show a daycare center whose location is unclear in which children are seen playing in the courtyard while they are watched by a number of female daycare workers.</p>
                     <p>The first Ana Betancourt school for teaching peasant women sewing and tailoring was founded at the end of 1959, with the first graduation ceremony in 1960. The first classes were held in a salon of the luxurious, once five-star Hotel Nacional and then transferred to an opulent mansion in Miramar abandoned by a wealthy family whose interests were jeopardized by the Revolution. As word got out about the opportunity to study in Havana with all boarding and matriculation costs paid by the government, the number of peasant women enrolled in the school ballooned from a few hundred to over 15,000 by 1960. Methods for the cutting and sewing of clothes developed at the school were given the name "Ana Betancourt" and patterns labeled with this name began to appear in women's magazines published by the revolutionary government organ known as the Federación de Mujeres Cubanas (FMC) as early as 1961.</p>
