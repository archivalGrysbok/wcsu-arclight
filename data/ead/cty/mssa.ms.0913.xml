         <p>Thomas Rogers Forbes was born in New York City on January 5, 1911. He earned both his 1933 bachelor's degree and his 1937 doctorate at the University of Rochester. Forbes taught anatomy at Johns Hopkins University, 1937-1942. During World War II, he interrupted his teaching to serve on the Committee on Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1945, he was appointed instructor in anatomy at the Yale School of Medicine. He served as an assistant professor from 1946 to 1951, associate professor from 1951-1962, and attained the rank of professor in 1962. He served concurrently as assistant and then associate dean from 1948 to 1969, while also chairing the Committee on Admissions. Forbes was appointed Ebenezer K. Hunt Professor of Anatomy in 1977. In 1979, he became professor emeritus and senior research scholar in the history of medicine.</p>
         <p>Forbes made fundamental contributions to reproductive endocrinology as a scientist and also won recognition as a medical historian. With Charles W. Hooker in 1946, Forbes developed an accurate method to measure minute quantities of progesterone. The Hooker Forbes bioassay became a standard method in endocrinology. Over the next thirty years, Forbes and his collaborators contributed substantially to the understanding of progesterone's role in pregnancy. His scholarly achievements included several books on early English forensic medicine. His books on early medical jurisprudence reflect personalities, as well as the standards of expertise then extant in the field. Forbes was an innovative teacher, producing films to teach medical history to students.</p>
         <p>He married Helen Frances Allen in 1934. They had two sons, Thomas R. Jr., and William M. Thomas Rogers Forbes died in Branford, Connecticut on November 13, 1988.</p>

               <p>The series includes correspondence and other papers that document Forbes's professional activities and acquaintances. There are few family letters. The files of greatest substance focus on Forbes's administrative and committee work at Yale and his participation in a medical mission for the Unitarian Service Committee.</p>
               <p>The files are in two sequences following Forbes's own designation: an alphabetical arrangement by the name of an individual, institution, or journal, and a chronological file. The files include incoming and outgoing letters with colleagues, students, suppliers, institutions, and journals, including the <title render="italic">
                     Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences
                  </title>. The Yale material, which is arranged by department or unit, includes documents associated with Forbes's responsibilities within the Department of Anatomy, the Dean's Office, the Admissions Committee, the History of Medicine Department, and the Medical School Council, and as advisor on medical memorabilia. The Unitarian Service Committee files detail Forbes's 1950 trip to lecture to German medical students and physicians whose learning and work had been interrupted by World War II . These files also include correspondence in the years following Forbes's return to the United States.</p>

               <p>The files in this series reflect Forbes's research interests both in the laboratory and in the field of medical history as well as his teaching in the class room. The teaching files, which include syllabi and lectures, are arranged chronologically by institution. They are predominantly from Yale, but include some earlier material from the University of Rochester and Johns Hopkins University</p>
               <p>The research materials contain laboratory notebooks and files concerning collaborations with students and colleagues, including Charles Hooker, in scientific research and writing. In the laboratory notebooks, experiments are labeled in sequences designated "series" by Forbes. Because he recorded a new series of experiments in a new notebook, even while an earlier series was still in progress, the notebooks are in overlapping chronological order. They include experiments on alligators, lizards, muskrats and progesterone. Research support from government and private agencies, as well as pharmaceutical companies, is also documented. Grant applications often provide partial bibliographies of Forbes's voluminous writings. These are useful, since no complete bibliography is available in the papers.</p>
               <p>The writings are arranged chronologically by type. Articles, both on laboratory research and on medical history comprise the bulk of the writings, but there are also files for books, films, abstracts, book reviews, lectures, and short stories. Experiments that were written up but not published are also included with the articles. The dates shown correspond to the dates of the material filed, not necessarily to the date of publication of the title.</p>
