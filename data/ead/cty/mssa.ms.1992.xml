         <p>Elizabeth Cutter Morrow was born May 29, 1873, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Charles Long Cutter and Annie E. Spencer Cutter.  She attended Miss Mittleberger's School in Cleveland, Ohio, and received a BL degree from Smith College.  She also studied at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, from 1896 to 1897 as well as in Florence, Italy.  In 1903 Elizabeth Cutter married Dwight W. (Whitney) Morrow, who was born in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1873 and graduated from Amherst College in 1896.  He served as the United States Ambassador to Mexico from 1927 to 1930 and served in the United States Senate from 1930 until his death on October 5, 1931. The Morrows had four children: Elizabeth Reeve, Anne Spencer (wife of Charles Augustus Lindbergh), Dwight W. (Whitney), Jr., and Constance Cutter.</p>
         <p>Elizabeth Cutter Morrow was a teacher prior to her marriage and wrote prose, poetry, and multiple children's books including <title>
               The Painted Pig
            </title>, <title>
               Quatrains for My Daughter
            </title>, <title>
               The Rabbit's Nest
            </title>, <title>
               Shannon
            </title>, <title>
               A Pint of Judgment
            </title>, and <title>
               Casa Ma√±ana
            </title>. She received six honorary degrees and served Smith College as acting president, trustee, and president of the alumnae association.  She died January 23, 1955.</p>
         <p>Dwight W. (Whitney) Morrow, Jr., was born November 28, 1908, the only son of Elizabeth Cutter and Dwight W. Morrow.  He was educated at Groton School, Groton, Massachusetts, and spent the summer after graduation working in St. John's, Newfoundland, for the International Grenfell Association.  He graduated from Amherst College in 1933, received an MA and PhD from Harvard, and attended Yale Law School from 1936 to 1938.</p>
         <p>In 1928, he suffered his first episode of mental illness and was withdrawn from Groton School by his parents.  Through treatment and his work in Newfoundland, he recovered sufficiently and began his freshman year at Amherst.  He continued to struggle with mental illness, however, and received treatment, including multiple hospital stays, throughout his life. He was diagnosed as having paranoid-schizophrenia. Despite his mental illness, Morrow led a productive life as an educator.  He taught at Lincoln University and Temple University.  He was a cofounder of The Monterey Institute of International Studies, established in 1955.  He also managed two ranches in Carmel Valley, California.  In 1937, he married Margot Loines with whom he had three children.  In 1970, he married Nancy Schallert Lofton of Carmel, California.  He died April 9, 1976.</p>
