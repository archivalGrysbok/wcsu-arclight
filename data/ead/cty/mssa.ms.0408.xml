         <p>Arthur Bernhard Recknagel died August 8, 1962. He was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., December 15, 1883. He prepared for Yale at Adelphi Academy, Brooklyn. After graduation Arthur went to the Yale Forestry School, making Sigma Xi (the scientific honor society) and graduating <emph render="italic">magna cum laude</emph> in 1906. He went directly into the government forestry service and was successively Forest Assistant (1906-7), Chief of Reconnaissance on National Forests of the West (1907-8), Chief of Silviculture, Southwestern District (1908-10) and Assistant District Forester with headquarters at Albuquerque, N. Mex. (1910-13). During the academic year 1911-12 he travelled abroad, studying the forests of northern Europe. In 1913 he was called to the Professorship of Forest Management and Utilization at Cornell, becoming later Chairman of the Department and retiring in 1943, to become a consulting forester. Meanwhile he had held visiting professorships at California and the University of British Columbia and had published many articles and books of high distinction in the field of Forestry. During the Second World War he was Area Forester at Albany for the War Production Board.</p>
         <p>Arthur was President of the Northwestern Wood Utilization Council, Vice-president and Director of the Empire State Forest Products Association, Technical Director of Forestry for the St. Regis Paper Company. As supervisor of two million acres of timberland all over the United States he traveled widely but still contributed more than his share to the welfare of his own community. He was a vestryman of St. John's Episcopal Church in Ithaca and chairman of the Cornell University Christian Association.</p>
         <p>Arthur was married in 1909 to Mary Thomas Miller of Harrisburg, Va. They have two sons: Bernard W., born in 1912, and Thomas M., born in 1918. After the death of his first wife Arthur married Miss Helen Johnston who survives him. Mrs. Recknagel lives at 107 Cayuga Heights Road, Ithaca, N.Y.</p>
