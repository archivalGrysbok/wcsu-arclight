         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Charles P. Rockwood Papers consist of one box of correspondence, clippings, photographs, memorabilia, and a 23 page diary Rockwood wrote as historian of the Yale Glee Club's 1939 summer tour of Europe.</p>
         <p>Correspondence is arranged chronologically, and is composed mainly of letters written by Rockwood to his parents and sister. From 1939-1940 Rockwood served as a teacher for Yale-in-China at Yuanling, Hunan Province. His letters describe activities of the Yali Middle School and life in wartime China. Almost all of them are in the form of typed copies intended for circulation to friends. In June, 1940, Rockwood contracted poliomyelitis and in November he returned to the United States. The correspondence of this period, largely telegrams and letters of others, concerns the diagnosis and treatment of his illness, as does a 9 page memorandum written by Rockwood for his doctor in 1941.</p>
         <p>After his recovery Rockwood served as a navigator for United Air Lines, but there is no correspondence about this period. In 1943 he joined the U.S. Office of War Information and began distributing leaflets, seed packets, and supplies in rural areas of India, Burma, and China. The papers contain his letters home between 1944-1945. They are necessarily vague about their place of origin due to wartime restrictions and generally describe daily routine.</p>

         <p>CHARLES P. ROCKWOOD</p>
         <p>Member of executive staff, Haskins &amp; Sells, public accounting, 2 Broadway, New York 4, N.Y.; res., 214 Old Army Rd., Scarsdale, N.Y., m. Lois K. Adams, 2/2/46; children: Peter B., b. 8/15/47; Anthony A., b. 12/29/48, John A., b. 6/1/50; Jane P., b. 7/27/54; Elizabeth W., b. 2/6/57.</p>
         <p>Charley was an instructor at Yale-in-China the first year after graduation and thinks he would "be involved in Asia still if China had not gone the way she did." Instead he spent the war years as air navigator for United Air Lines under contract with the Air Transport Command (1942-43) and with Office of War Information psychological warfare teams in India, Burma and China (1943-45). For a year after the war he was export-import representative of the Wah Chang Trading Corporation, then became executive secretary of the American Institute of Pacific Relations, Pacific Northwest Division. In 1950 he received an M.A. in economics and international studies (Asia) from the University of Washington. Charley then became staff associate of the Twentieth Century Fund until 1955 when he became public relations director of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He took his present position in 1963. Rockwood was a member of the Public Relations Society of America, the Explorers Club, Yale-in-China Assoc. (vice-president), Asia Society-Burma Council, Scarsdale Fair Housing Committee, Yale Club of New York City and Fox Meadow Tennis Club. He is the author of "The Changing Image of a Profession", <emph render="italic">Journal of Accountancy</emph>, Oct. 1960.</p>
         <p>Wife, Lois, was in the Class of 1948 at Cornell. Their three boys are in the classes of 1966, 1967 and 1968 at Hackley School and he is a trustee of the Hackley School Fathers Assoc. "Traveling en famille is planned for the future. Meanwhile, much of our time and affection goes into the family camp at Tupper Lake in the Adirondacks."</p>
         <p>(Taken from <emph render="italic">Twenty-Five Years Out</emph>, published by the Class of Nineteen Thirty-Nine, Yale University. June, 1964).</p>
