         <p>Although Alphonso B. Brown was a physician who spent most of his life in Newburyport, Mass, the papers largely reflect his experiences as a member of the Frederick A. Cook expedition to the Arctic in 1894. Included are a journal kept on board the S.S. Miranda (1894 Jul 7, Sep 8), photographs, clippings and memorabilia. Also, in the papers, are a letter and report on the work of the Yale Mission in New Haven (1893).</p>
         <p>The photographs of the expedition have been filmed and are available on Microfilm HM 76.</p>

         <p>Alphonso Bickford Brown was the eldest son of Elisha R. and Frances (Bickford) Brown, and was born in Dover, N.H., January 23, 1872. He was named for his grandfather, Dr. Alphonso Bickford, who was for many years one of Dover's most distinguished physicians. He was graduated from Phillips-Andover and in college secured a Dissertation appointment both in Junior Year and at Commencement. He was graduated from the Harvard Medical School in June, 1898, with the degree of M.D. and served on the surgical staff of the Boston City Hospital from January, 1898, to July, 1899. He then took up the practice of his profession in Newburyport, Mass., and on October 3, 1899, he married Miss Edith Lawrence Huse, daughter of Hon. William H. Huse, at Dover, N.H. One child, a daughter, Elizabeth Lawrence, was born to them July 6, 1902.</p>
         <p>About two weeks before his death Dr. Brown was operated upon for appendicitis and seemed to be making rapid progress toward complete recovery, when from some cause not clearly understood his condition took a sudden turn for the worse and he died quite suddenly and unexpectedly on October 17, 1906. A local paper said editorially of him: "Dr. Brown was one of the best young men Dover has produced: he was a gentleman, in the true sense of the word, everywhere and on all occasions. Everybody liked him who made his acquaintance. His scholarly attainments and his skill and success as a young physician gave assured promise that had it been granted him to live, in good health, to old age, he would have held very high rank in his profession."</p>
