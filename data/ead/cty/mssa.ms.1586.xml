The materials document aspects of the policy of Indirect Rule pursued by the Colonial Government dating ca. 1908-1950, including the establishment and consolidation of a hierarchy of administrative units for ruling rural Nigerians. A good number of the files were produced in the years 1925-1940 when the application of Indirect Rule was intensified. The files were meant to provide subsequent Colonial officers with an "official knowledge" of the culture, language, economic activities, beliefs and other customs of each locality and ethnic group. Individuals who authored several of these files include J. H. Shaw, C. K. Meek, J. G. Davies, F. G. Raynolds, D. A. Percival, C. W. Rowlings, and R. C. S. Stanley. The collection also includes Harold Gunn's correspondence and research notes from 1931 to 1982.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The papers consist of a unique collection of reports, memoranda, research materials and maps that document aspects of the policy of Indirect Rule pursued by the British Colonial Government of Nigeria dating ca. 1908-1950. The focus includes the ways the Colonial Government subsequently implemented this policy by establishing and consolidating a hierarchy of new administrative units. The information on this process was compiled by two groups of government functionaries who performed largely complimentary duties. The first group consisted of district officers who served as frontline implementors of the colonial project. The other group involved experts, mainly research anthropologists, who were charged with the tasks of "understanding" and "documenting" the cultures, languages and administrative customs of the "natives."</p>
         <p>Reports compiled by district officers can be broadly categorized into two types. A considerable number of them describe specific administrative duties at a district level and were part of a larger collection called "District Notebooks." These files seek to "assess" and sometimes "reassess" the process of "organizing" and "reorganizing" different areas into a three-tier vertically connected administrative structure. These three levels were, in a descending order, provinces, divisions, and districts. For the most part, Northern Nigeria was divided into eleven provinces, namely, Adamawa, Bauchi, Benue, Bornu, Ilorin, Kabba, Kano, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto and Zaria. Each province was further divided into divisions, and each division into several districts. All villages and localities of Nigeria were gradually incorporated into this framework, except a few districts which were recognized as "independent districts," sometimes called "emirates," to be governed by hereditary rulers.</p>
         <p>The most rare items in this collection include place name gazetteers for almost all the eleven provinces. Produced with official authorization of the British, these gazetteers were used, among other things, for generating a number of maps illuminating administrative boundaries, settlement patterns, landscapes and road networks (see series VI below).</p>
         <p>Other scarce items in the collection include district-specific files entitled "Intelligence Reports" produced by prominent colonial officers including J. H. Shaw, C. K. Meek, J. G. Davies, F. G. Raynolds, D. A. Percival, C. W. Rowlings, and R. C. S. Stanley. These reports provide original information on wide-ranging administrative and political issues that the indirect rule policy encountered upon implementation. Some of these issues included public disturbance, inter-district border disputes, inter-ethnic conflicts, problems of succession among customary rulers of different "tribes," and resistance to taxes and government attempts at restricting population movement and power of native courts. Some of the reports also document government concerns with witchcraft, magic and aspects of "traditional" marriage customs, such as "concubinage," dowry and "marriage by exchange." Harold D. Gunn and his fellow anthropologists at the International African Studies Institute used some of this information in writing materials for a series called "Ethnography of Africa South of the Sahara."</p>
         <p>The collection also includes a large number of memoranda through which senior officials at provincial capitals communicated with their subordinates at divisional and district levels. On their turn, lower officials kept their superiors informed by sending back a number of reports and letters. Most of these correspondence files are dated, signed and sealed. Researchers would find them useful for reconstructing administrative and political histories of the region. Finally, researchers would also find a large collection of vocabularies and research materials on more than forty Northern Nigerian local languages.</p>

               <p>The British Colonial government of Northern Nigeria ruled this region by reorganizing it into three vertically connected administrative levels. These were, in a descending order, provinces, divisions, and districts. For the most part, the region was divided into eleven provinces, namely, Adamawa, Bauchi, Benue, Bornu, Ilorin, Kabba, Kano, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto and Zaria. Each province was further divided into divisions, and each division into several districts. All villages and localities of Northern Nigeria were incorporated into this structure except a few "independent districts" which were recognized as "emirates" and "chiefdoms" of co-opted hereditary rulers. Files in this series consist of memoranda, reports, and anthropological and historical notes produced by agents of the Colonial government who performed wide-ranging duties in different levels of this hierarchy. For this reason, the files are arranged both hierarchically and alphabetically. The series begins with folders of regional files that deal with different administrative issues pertaining to more than one province. This is followed by several files on eleven alphabetically arranged provinces and their subdivision districts.</p>
               <p>Files on each province are alphabetically arranged by administrative levels in a descending order. Researchers would first find "general files" that deal with issues pertaining to the province-level government or more than one of its constituent divisions. This is followed by files belonging to individual divisions of that province. The last sub-category consists of files that pertain to several other districts of the province for which we lack information on the division to which they belonged. As noted above, "emirates" were exceptions in legal status and autonomy. Nevertheless, each emirate was situated within the territory of one of the eleven provinces. For this reason, files pertaining to emirates are alphabetically listed with divisional-level files.</p>

               <p>The files in this series document the perspectives of colonial officials and experts on the nomadic cattle herding Fulani and three other larger groups (Hausa, Tuareg and Wolof). Arranged alphabetically by ethnic group, most of the files are on the Fulani, perhaps because of their significance in terms of the size of the area they occupied and patterns of their seasonal migration. The series also includes an equally large number of files on the Tiv people which is categorized under Benue province where the Tiv lived in their own administrative unit called "Tiv division."</p>
               <p>Researchers would also find in this series questionnaires specially designed by anthropologists to collect ethnographic data on social organization and economic activities of the Fulani and Tuareg.</p>

               <p>The files in this series are arranged alphabetically within the five sections relating to the following: Beliefs, cults and native religion; Land tenure and land use practices; Marriage customs; Native court cases, and Political notes and policy papers. Producers of these files include anthropologists and officers, such as J. O. Clarke, K. Dewar, D. A. Percival, J. G. Davies and C. K Meek.</p>
               <p>Files on religion cover wide-ranging issues surrounding witchcraft, fertility rituals, and cults of various types. Likewise, files under land tenure and land use practices provide useful demographic and economic information, including population size by district, and household-level data on budgets and livelihoods. Files on marriage concern customary practices, such as concubinage, dowry, and wife exchange ("marriage by exchange"), that seemed "backward" in the eyes of colonial officials. The series also contains files on the functioning of native courts and policy papers that discuss the future of Nigeria.</p>

               <p>This series includes a large collection of vocabularies and anthropological notes on more than forty alphabetically arranged local ("native") languages in northern Nigeria. These vocabularies seem to have been collected over a long period of time by several individuals, including missionaries and district officers. The series also features a comparative table and other linguistic tools designed by researchers to determine similarities and differences among these languages. There is also one file containing correspondence notes exchanged between Harold D. Gunn and Joseph H. Greenberg concerning the languages of Northern Nigeria.</p>

               <p>A considerable number of the files in this series consists of Harold Gunn's letters personally written to, and received from, different individuals. The series also contains research materials and field notes on the provinces and divisions he visited at different times while working for the International African Institute. There are also some fragment notes, extracts and newspaper clips which were enclosed in the correspondence. The series also includes two grant applications, documenting Harold Gunn's attempts to obtain funds for arranging and preserving this collection. Also included are some lecture notes for a sociology class and a feature article on "Black Music" that appeared in a school bulletin.</p>

               <p>Files in this series consists of maps and sketches drawn by the British Colonial government of Nigeria. Alphabetically arranged, most of these files illuminate boundaries and territories of different provinces, divisions and districts. The series also includes historical maps that show territories of some of the Kingdoms and Emirates that existed in the region as "independent" political units. Examples of these "pre-British" political units include the Kingdoms of Koton-Karifi and Kuta, and the Emirates of Dikawa, Hadejia and Katsina. Other important maps include a 1913 map showing railroads constructed in the region up to that year, and a 1937 map illustrating "amended provincial boundaries." One would also find a "gazetteer of place names" on a 1:50,000 scale map. There is also one undated "tribal map" which shows the distribution of ethnic groups in the region. Researchers would also find several other "tribal maps" that often bear the names of particular ethnic groups in the title.</p>
               <p>The series also contains four large "Forest Reconnaissance Maps" drawn by government experts in Lagos in 1947-1948. These maps provide substantial information on the landscape, although their coverage is limited to four divisions, namely Jemaa, Gombe, Pankshin and Tangale Waja. In each map, researchers would find references to community forest areas, forest reserve proposals, hills, escarpments, road networks, foot paths and administrative boundaries.</p>
