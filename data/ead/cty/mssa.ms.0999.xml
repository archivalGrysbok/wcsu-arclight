               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This collection consists of a single bound volume containing photostatic copies of letters written in the form of a diary by Nathaniel Hobart (d. 1840) to members of his family during "a long journey West and South" in 1837-1838. His wife, Lydia, transcribed his letters for her children, as she explains in a letter prefaced to the volume, and it is her transcriptions which have been photocopied and bound.</p>
               <p>Hobart, a Bostonian, may have been a merchant. His trip took him through New England south to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, through Tennessee, and back through Washington, D.C., and Delaware to Boston. The cities through which he passed are described in an interesting fashion with special attention being given to New Orleans and Washington, D.C. Hobart digresses to discuss his views on religion and philosophy. A Swedenborgian, he was the author of several books on Swedenborg, including <emph render="italic">The Life of Emanuel Swedenborg</emph> (1830). While traveling in the South, he often comments on the southern way of life and sets forth his observations on slavery (see particularly pp. 90-102).</p>
               <p>The letters also contain an account of a second journey which Hobart made in May of 1838 through the Great Lakes region, going as far west as Michigan and Wisconsin. He describes the cities he visited, the greatest detail being given to Niagara Falls.</p>
               <p>Page 108 of the volume is missing, and pages 171-177 are out of place. The volume was presented by Geoffrey Hobart Byrne to Chauncey Brewster Tinker in 1949, and he in turn donated it to Yale in 1950. The current owner of the original letters is unknown.</p>
