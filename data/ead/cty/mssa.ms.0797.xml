         <abstract id="aspace_694b4a5c8eb4ba8e7394d11cca42240e">The principal figures in these papers are Phillips Foster Greene, a physician and missionary, and his wife, Ruth Altman Greene, a teacher and writer who accompanied her husband during his service of nearly twenty years at the Yale-in-China Medical School in Changsha (1921-1943) and seven years in Rangoon (1951-1958). The papers consist largely of correspondence with family in the United States and with Yale-in-China staff members. The letters are important sources of information on social conditions in China and political events, as well as a record of the Greenes' day-to-day activities. Also in the papers are financial records, newspaper clippings, copies of their articles on life at Changsha, and photographs.</abstract>
