         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These papers consist primarily of diaries and account books of George Henry Hubbard, missionary of the American Board in China for forty years, 1885-1925. The diaries, for the years 1896-1897 and 1908, describe Hubbard's travels and activities in Fukien Province as an administrator of various schools, hospitals, and missions. The account books for one of his schools and for his personal expenses provide valuable material about the economic situation and the cost of living in Fukien around the turn of the century. All five of these volumes have loose papers laid in such as receipts, notes, and items in Chinese, both printed and manuscript. Four letters to Hubbard which concern routine mission business are also included.</p>
         <p>Two items in the collection pertain to Hubbard's mother-in-law, Hannah Louise (Plimpton) Peet, later Mrs. Charles Hartwell (d. 1908). One is a diary for 1894 containing school lessons by Mrs. Hartwell, then wife of Charles Hartwell, one of Hubbard's fellow missionaries in Foochow. The other item is a book of notes on Milton's <title render="italic">
               Paradise Lost
            </title> made by her in 1847, presumably while a student at Mt. Holyoke College.</p>
         <p>The provenance of these papers is unknown.</p>
