         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The bulk of the material in the WORLD WAR II COLLECTION was gathered in connection with a project sponsored during the war by the United States Office of Strategic Services. This operation, called the "Yale Library Project," was devised in 1942 and had as its purpose the collection of Axis intelligence through an agent stationed in a neutral country. Joseph T. Curtiss, a professor of English at Yale University, was chosen by the OSS as the agent whose ostensible mission was to collect war propaganda for the Yale Library. He was sent to Turkey in April 1943 and until his departure in September 1945 he not only gathered material for the OSS, but also shipped two tons of war literature back to the United States. These publications were ultimately distributed among a number of interested libraries, including Yale.</p>
         <p>Yale also received two substantial gifts of propaganda material prepared by the Psychological Warfare Branch of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Colonel Heber Blankenhorn contributed leaflets, newspapers, and brochures designed for the European theatre, while Colonel Jo Zack Miller donated several series of leaflets prepared for use in the Pacific. Other gifts have expanded the collection to include posters and memorabilia as well as printed matter.</p>
         <p>In addition the collection includes a number of diaries, letters and reports by civilians who were in the war zones. These were sent to the Yale Library by interested alumni and others who wanted a permanent place to deposit these accounts. In 1981 all this material was brought together under the general title: World War II Collection.</p>
         <p>The collection contains materials printed in fifteen languages from some fifty countries and gives the reader a broad sampling of the aims and propaganda appeals of both Axis and Allied governments, including governments-in-exile. The material has been divided into three series: Series I, GENERAL PUBLICATIONS; Series II, LEAFLETS, NEWSPAPERS AND REPORTS; and Series III, CIVILIAN CORRESPONDENCE, DIARIES AND MEMORABILIA.</p>
         <p>Series I, GENERAL PUBLICATIONS is arranged alphabetically by the name of the country issuing the material and further divided by language. Occasional monographs printed independently or in scholarly journals during the war are also included, and are filed according to the country of their subject. The publications of official government agencies, governments-in-exile and of support groups abroad are all filed under the name of the country. The literature issued in Polish and English by the Polish government-in-exile, for example, as well as publications by sympathetic American Polish groups are all filed under Poland. A similar procedure was followed for the governments-in-exile of France and the Netherlands. Literature issued by the German occupation authorities in those countries will be found under "Germany - French language" and "Germany - Dutch language." The publications of the native collaborationist group in the Netherlands, however, are filed under Netherlands.</p>
         <p>The publications of the governments-in-exile tend to be theoretical and historical in nature, while the literature issued by the governments actively engaged in the conflict is on a more pragmatic level with bulletins on how to use a gas mask, on war time nutrition, on production levels, etc. The materials for the United States and Great Britain cover ca. 10 and 4 linear feet respectively and contain civilian as well as official government materials providing an overview of life in these countries during the war. Included are campaign histories, literature issued by war protesters, government reports on domestic and foreign affairs, materials issued by war relief organizations, memoranda on post war aims and considerable material issued by civilian defense organizations.</p>
         <p>A small number of special subjects have been interfiled among the countries in the appropriate alphabetical position. These are: Catholic Church, Concentration camps, Jews, NATO, United Nations, UNRRA, and War crimes and trials.</p>
         <p>Series II, LEAFLETS, NEWSPAPERS AND REPORTS is made up of what were called "white bombs" i.e. propaganda leaflets dropped from airplanes and manifestos and newspapers issued by the military in the course of field operations. The series is divided into two parts. The first consists of leaflets arranged by the issuing agency or country, and grouped according to the population to which it was directed. The Allied Command, for example, issued separate literature for the German army, for German civilians and for foreign workers in Germany.</p>
         <p>This part also contains an exceptionally complete series of leaflets issued in the last days of the campaign in the Pacific. Included are leaflets addressed to Japanese soldiers urging them to surrender, a variety of safe-conduct passes, and instructions on how to approach American army lines. There are also leaflets addressed to the civilian populations in the Philippines, Okinawa, Formosa and other islands, issued as the fighting approached these areas. Most of the leaflets and newspapers, some of which were meant to be dropped by airplane in combat areas, are accompanied by English translations. The sophisticated design and typography will be an additional source of interest to students of the period. It should be noted that this part contains publications not only by the Allies, but also leaflets issued by Germany and Japan addressed to Allied troops and urging surrender.</p>
         <p>The second part of the series consists of newspapers and other publications issued by the advancing Allied armies after the D-Day invasion, arranged by language. Since the literature dates from the last years of the war, the items from Europe contain many news bulletins (in the leaflets as well as the newspapers) charting the daily progress of the advancing Russian and Allied armies. Also included here are reports, memoranda and manuals concerning the psychological warfare operations of the United States and of the Allied Expeditionary Force.</p>
         <p>Series III, CIVILIAN CORRESPONDENCE, DIARIES AND MEMORABILIA consists of letters from Americans in various parts of the world to their family and friends at home relating their war experiences. The letters are arranged by the country from which they were written and come from all parts of Asia and Europe, with one letter from the Argentine Republic. Of special interest is a letter to her parents from a young girl who was in Hawaii at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor giving a civilian report on the event. Mementoes of both German and Allied origin make up the few items of memorabilia included in this series.</p>
