         <p>The records of the Coalition to Stop Trident are arranged in three series and primarily document the activities of several anti-nuclear groups in Connecticut protesting against the development of the Trident military defense system. The manuscript group also holds a number of collected materials which serve to place the activities of these groups into the context of the broader national and international disarmament movements in which they took part. The administrative records of the Coalition to Stop Trident and of its predecessor, the Trident/Conversion campaign, are particularly interesting because they give an excellent example of the processes, discussions, theories, and principles common to the organization of grassroots movements. The numerous files on the demonstrations held to protest nuclear arms generally and the Trident system specifically contain substantive information which can be used to reconstruct the history of the disarmament movement in Connecticut and Southern New England. There is also ample documentation of the philosophy behind the peace and disarmament movements.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Although the Coalition to Stop Trident (CST) was not formally established until 1984, resistance to the construction of the Trident submarines in Connecticut began with a protest during the keel laying of the first Trident, the USS Ohio, in 1976. Southeastern Connecticut became a national locus for demonstrations supporting nuclear disarmament and protesting against the construction of the Trident and other "fast attack submarines," largely because the submarines were built at Electric Boat, a ship yard situated in Groton, Connecticut. Ceremonies at Electric Boat and at nearby naval bases marking the launching and commissioning of the submarines provided high profile opportunities for protest against their construction and more broadly against the nuclear arms race.</p>
         <p>The history of resistance to the Trident program is complex. As their name suggests, the Coalition to Stop Trident was comprised of several different local affinity groups working toward eradicating nuclear weaponry. Other groups, though not formally part of the CST, participated in and assisted with several demonstrations and actions. To further complicate matters, the work of several different groups preceded the CST in organizing resistance to Trident and other nuclear weaponry. Although perhaps slightly divided on questions of theory and method, all of these groups were united by the need to stop the production of nuclear arms, particularly in Connecticut.</p>
         <p>"Trident" is an overall military nuclear program comprised of Trident submarines and two generations of missiles, the Trident I, which became operational in 1979 with the launching of the USS Ohio, and the Trident II, which became operational in 1986 with the launching of the USS Tennessee, the ninth Trident submarine. Planning for the Trident program began in the early 1970s. The USS Ohio was launched in 1979 and was commissioned into the United States Navy in 1981. The USS Wyoming, the seventeenth Trident, was commissioned in 1996, and the submarines continue to be produced. The Trident submarines, which measure 560 feet in length and can carry up to twenty-four highly explosive nuclear missiles with long range capabilities, brought unprecedented speed, accuracy, and power to an already potent fleet of "fast attack" submarines. Trident allowed the Navy to possess the "first strike" option, an ability to quickly attack and destroy an opponent's defenses, thereby rendering them unable to retaliate.</p>
         <p>Anti-nuclear groups, many of which grew out of the peace movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s, saw the development of Trident as making nuclear war more dangerous and more likely. They believed that rather than acting merely as a deterrent, the faster, more accurate, and more powerful weapons would make the option of using them without retaliation more viable. The enhanced defense abilities also would cause opponents to be more likely to launch their own weapons on only the suspicion rather than the reality of an attack. Furthermore, most of these groups protested against the large budgetary allotments made to the Trident program (each submarine costs approximately two billion dollars to produce). The anti-nuclear protestors favored a conversion of the Connecticut economy from the highly influential defense industries to services which would combat the social problems of homelessness, poverty, unemployment, poor health care, and ineffective public education.</p>
         <p>Protests against the Trident program involved many different groups and individuals. The most prominent organizations which preceded the formation of the CST included the Atlantic Life Network, the Trident/Conversion Campaign, the American Friends Service Committee of Connecticut, Connecticut Freeze Campaign, the War Resister's League, and Spinsters Opposed to Nuclear Genocide. Membership in the groups often overlapped.</p>
         <p>The protests themselves were organized in an ad hoc manner and varied widely. The largest demonstrations usually coincided with the launching or commissioning of a new Trident submarine. Actions at these events often took on two forms: legal demonstrations and civil disobedience. Legal demonstrations included prayer vigils, leafleting, marching, "die-in's," chanting, music, street theater, and speakers. Civil disobedience technique generally consisted of attempts to disrupt the normal course of business, or celebratory activities at the site of the protest. Protestors involved in the civil disobedience actions practiced non-violence, and these actions usually resulted in their arrest.</p>
         <p>In July 1982, a more radical form of direct action against the Trident program ensued in Connecticut when nine women and men broke into the Electric Boat shipyard, spray-painted "USS AUSCHWITZ," poured their own blood, and hammered on sonar devices on the USS Florida, the third of the Trident submarines. These nine protestors, who became known as "Trident Nein," were arrested and some of them ended up imprisoned. Protests such as these became known as "Plowshares" actions, the name being taken from the biblical verse, "and they shall beat their swords into plowshares." Plowshares actions recurred four other times in Connecticut and at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, the site of another Electric Boat shipyard. The break-ins and the trials of the Plowshares groups, especially Trident Nein and Plowshares #4, were covered extensively by local media and even received national attention. The trials and sentencings of these groups also resulted in staged demonstrations supporting their actions and protesting their incarceration.</p>
         <p>During the weekend of June 18-20, 1983, large demonstrations were organized to protest the commissioning of the USS Florida, the third Trident submarine christened into the United States Navy, and to observe the International Day of Disarmament. Several groups and individuals formed the "June 18-20 Coalition" to plan these events. This group served as the precursor to the Coalition to Stop Trident, which formed in the early months of 1984.</p>
         <p>The CST was initially comprised of Rhode Island Mobilization for Survival, Spinsters Opposed to Nuclear Genocide, Trident Nein, and the War Resistor's League of Norwich, Connecticut. By 1988 the CST had evolved to include the Isaiah Peace Ministry, Witness for Disarmament, New Haven Against Trident II, and Hartford Against Trident II. The CST organized and sponsored several activities ranging from educational outreach to continuing demonstrations protesting the launchings and commissionings of Trident submarines. In perhaps its most sustained effort, the CST kicked off a two-year campaign in 1986 to increase awareness about the Trident program with the goal of stopping the deployment of the Trident II missiles which became operational in December 1986. The largest of the events organized under the two-year campaign occurred on the weekend of October 24-26, 1987, dates of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis and International Disarmament Day.</p>
         <p>With the end of Cold War in the late 1980s, the intensity of the protests against the Trident program dropped off considerably. Although Trident submarines and missiles continued to be produced and deployed, the CST stopped holding regular meetings. Some of the local affinity groups which comprised the CST remained active, and new groups, such as the Trident Information Network, were formed. Through the activities of these groups, sporadic protests against Trident continued, but without reaching the same fervor as previous campaigns.</p>
         <p>The records of the Coalition to Stop Trident are arranged in three series and primarily document the activities of several anti-nuclear groups in Connecticut protesting against the development of the Trident military defense system. The Manuscript group also holds a number of collected materials which serve to place the activities of these groups into the context of the broader national and international disarmament movements in which they took part.

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The Organizational Records series is comprised of materials relating to resistance to the production of Trident submarines and missiles in Connecticut and New England. The series holds the most substantive records in this Manuscript group and is divided into five sections: Coalition to Stop Trident(CST) Office Files, Trident/Conversion Campaign, Other groups, Demonstrations, and Trident system files.</p>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the Coalition to Stop Trident Office Files contain administrative records and organizing materials used by the Coalition. Brief histories of the CST can be found in "Brochures and newsletters, 1985, 1988" and "Grant applications 1986-1988." "Minutes and agendas, 1984-1988" hold valuable information on the history, structure, methods, and philosophies of the CST. Information on the orientation of the group is supplemented by materials found in "Goals and objectives, 1985-1986." Though far from complete, "Staff reports, 1988" provides a view of the activities of paid staff members of the CST. Other materials, including those found in "Organizing resources, n.d.," "Civil disobedience handbooks, 1983-1988, n.d.," and "Non-violence training materials, 1984, n.d.," were used by the CST when organizing their activities.</p>
               <p>The Trident/Conversion Campaign (T/CC) section holds materials relating to this predecessor of the CST, which was formed in 1978. Much of the work done by the T/CC was performed through the American Friends Service Committee of Connecticut (AFSC) whose staff members were Marta Daniels and Bruce Martin. Most of the "Correspondence, 1977-1983" was generated or received by Daniels and Martin and was written on AFSC stationery. These letters contain valuable information on many topics relating to anti-Trident work in Connecticut and elsewhere. Daniels was also a prolific writer on anti-nuclear issues, and a sampling of her work is found in "Daniels, Marta-Writings, 1977-1981, n.d." Finally, "Minutes, 1978-1989," and "Goals and strategies, 1979" provide information on the beginning of the T/CC and of its principles and activities.</p>
               <p>Other Connecticut Groups is a small but significant section which documents the work of organizations distinct from the CST and the T/CC but which did related work against Trident in Connecticut. "Atlantic Life Community, 1983-1985" holds several leaflets distributed to workers each week in a campaign at the Electric Boat shipyard. "Connecticut Freeze Campaign, 1981-1990" contains several different types of materials, including press releases, news clippings, flyers, and correspondence which document the activities of this group. "Ministry with Defense Workers, 1983-1984" is comprised of the correspondence, newsletters, and organizing resources of a group of local clergy who worked with employees of Electric Boat who were distraught about building nuclear weapons for a living. Finally, "Trident Information Network, 1992-1993" holds newsletters from a group which was a successor to the CST.</p>
               <p>The multiple actions taken by groups against the production of Trident are well documented in the Demonstrations section. This section is divided into three sub-sections, Trident Demonstrations, Other Demonstrations, and Plowshares, each of which is organized chronologically. The Trident actions pertain to protests of launchings (the first time a submarine goes out to sea), sea trials, or commissionings (when the submarine is christened into the fleet of the United States Navy) of new Trident submarines at Electric Boat shipyard in Groton or a nearby naval base in New London. Clippings from news coverage by local papers comprise the bulk of these records, but flyers, mailings, and leaflets are also included. Folders in Other Demonstrations contain similar materials about actions organized to protest nuclear weapons other than Trident. These demonstrations often coincided with the launching or commissioning of "fast attack submarines," and religious holidays. Performed by small, independent groups, Plowshares actions were direct attempts to sabotage the production of nuclear weaponry. These folders contain several clippings about the actions themselves and the trials of the individuals involved. These actions also spawned groups to support the Plowshares groups financially and morally as they faced incarceration. "Support groups" contain newsletters and mailings about the status of the trials faced by the members of the different Plowshares groups.</p>
               <p>The Trident System Files, the bulk of which are news clippings, document the production of the Trident submarines and missiles by their sole contractor, the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics. The "Alternative Use Study, 1984-1985" explores the possibility of a conversion of Electric Boat from the production of nuclear weapons to non-military commodities. Relations between Electric Boat and its employees are documented in "Employee lay-offs, 1977-1978," "Employee strike, 1988," and "Proescher, Richard, 1978-1980." The most substantive documentation on Trident submarines is held in "DMS Profiles, n.d.," "Fact sheets, n.d.," and "Technical Explanations, 1982-1986, n.d.." Finally, "Position papers, 1977-1983" contains articles both for and against the Trident system.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the Subject Files are a varied and not comprehensive source for topics, events, and groups relating to the disarmament movement on a national and international level. Materials include newsletters, flyers, mailings, and speeches. Although these records span from 1969 to 1993, the bulk falls between 1977 and 1989. These materials were collected by members of the Coalition to Stop Trident and other local groups and were used to support their anti-nuclear work. They serve to place the anti-Trident activism in Connecticut within a context of broader anti-nuclear movements. The researcher should be cautioned, however, that the materials represent only a sampling of those from the world-wide disarmament movement of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

               <p>Visual Materials contains photographs, a slide presentation, and exhibit posters. The photographs were taken in 1981 of protestors demonstrating against the sea trials and commissioning of the USS Ohio, the first Trident submarine. The Slide presentation was created by the CST to educate the public on the hazards of nuclear weapons and it includes both the script and slides. The Exhibit posters include photographs from demonstrations against Trident submarines accompanied by text which describes the events and anti-Trident work. The origin of these posters is unknown.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the addition includes correspondence, memoranda, publications, clippings, flyers, and other materials relating to the Coalition to Stop Trident and other local and national groups working to stop the production of nuclear weapons. The CST files from the main accession are supplemented by the "Statement on Disbandment," which gives the rationale behind the break-up of the group in 1989. Other files include a useful chronology of demonstrations against the Trident program, as well as a paper reflecting on the use of civil disobedience as a means of protest against Trident. The addition also documents the group, Witness for Disarmament, which was a member of the CST and continued to protest against the Trident program after the CST disbanded. Two folders of materials on the Plowshares movement, including chronologies of Plowshares actions, continue documentation found in the main accession. Clippings concerning the Electric Boat Corporation, the construction of Trident and other submarines, and the United States Department of Defense provide background information. Publications, flyers, clippings, newsletters, and other materials from related anti- nuclear groups serve to place the work of the CST and other local groups into a broader national and international movement against nuclear weapons.</p>

               <p>Files created and kept by the War Resister's League New England (WRLNE) comprise the accession. The records supplement the Demonstrations section of Series I in the main accession. As one of the groups that founded the coalition, the WRLNE played an active role in planning, organizing, and carrying out protests against the production of nuclear weapons, primarily submarines, in Connecticut. Arranged chronologically by demonstration, the files include correspondence, memoranda, clippings, press releases, flyers, notes, and other materials documenting the demonstrations and protests against nuclear weaponry in Connecticut. The files particularly reflect the work of Joanne Sheehan, one of the leaders in several groups involved in these demonstrations. One folder of clippings spanning several years and regarding defense contracts between the Electric Boat Company and the United States government is filed at the end of the listing.</p>
