         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Isaac Simha Hurewitz was born in Navahrudak, Russia (now Belarus) on October 9, 1868, the son of Joseph Dov and Beila Hurewitz. He studied at the great Lithuanian Jewish academies of Valozhyn and Slabotka, and received his rabbinical ordination in 1892 from Isaac Elhanan Spektor (1817-1896) of Kovno. Hurewitz and his wife Chaya Rivka (Ida Aaronson) immigrated to the United States in 1893 and settled in Hartford, Connecticut. During his 43 years in the rabbinate in Hartford he served the congregations Adas Israel, Agudas Achim, and Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (Garden Street Synagogue). In 1905 he also became the editor of the periodical, Yiddishe Shtimme (the Jewish Voice).  Rabbi Hurewitz was the author of Yad Ha-Levi, a commentary on Maimonides' Sefer ha-Mitsvot, which was published in Jerusalem in 1926. Among other topics the book included Rabbi Hurewitz's denunciation of American rabbis who adapted to Prohibition by permitting the substitution of grape juice for wine. Rabbi Hurewitz was the first Eastern European Orthodox rabbi in Hartford and was instrumental in establishing its Jewish charitable and educational institutions.   
The children of Rabbi Isaac Simha and Ida Hurewitz included: Dr. Herman Max Hurewitz (1890-1946),  Bessie H. Shetekoff (1893-1967), Rebecca H. Feldman (1895-1985), Anna H. Goldstein (1897-1975), Rachel (Rae) H. Gans (1898-1983), Lena B. Hurewitz (1900-1961), attorney Joseph Bernard Hurwitz (1901-1963),  Rose H. Zelcer (or Zeltzer) (1904-1989), Aaron Hurewitz (1907-1974), Freida (Freda or Fritzi) Jacobson (1909-2007), and J.C. (Jacob Coleman) Hurewitz (1914-2008; a political science professor at Columbia University). Ida Aaronson Hurewitz died on March 19,1932. In 1933 Rabbi Hurewitz took a second wife, Chana (Anna Gershowitz Hurewitz Greenberg), and they had a son, Samuel M. Hurewitz (1935-2015). Isaac Simha Hurewitz died on December 30, 1935.</p>
