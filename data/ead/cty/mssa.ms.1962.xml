         <p>The Love Makes a Family (LMF) records consist of email correspondence, bylaws, reports, meeting minutes, research data, publications, Web pages, social media account files, topical files, interviews and testimonies, photographs, audiovisual recordings, and newspaper clippings documenting the history, structure, and activities of LMF, Inc. and its related organizations, the LMF Political Action Committee (PAC) and the LMF Foundation. The records are comprised primarily of the records maintained by Anne Stanback (president and executive director)  and Carol Buckheit (associate director and executive director) and document all aspects of the organization including executive administration, strategy and policy development, fundraising, education and advocacy efforts, communications, and relationships to other marriage equailty organizations.  As LMF reached its first three goals in its first year, the vast majority of the records document the effort to legalize same-sex marriage.  The records document all the major developments of the marriage equality movement in Connecticut, as well as the broader national movement and its opposition.  Additionally individual lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered persons' lives and the impact of marriage discrimination is richly documented in testimonials, public hearing statements, and interviews.  To a lesser extent other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender anti-discrimination efforts in the state are also documented.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Love Makes a Family (LMF) (1999-2009) was a Connecticut statewide coalition of organizations and individuals whose mission was to pass a second-parent adoption law; support efforts to pass a domestic partnership package for state employees; defeat Defense of Marriage Amendments (DOMAs) both to the state statute and the state constitution; and to pass a marriage equality law for same-sex couples in Connecticut.  The first three goals were reached by 2000; the marriage equality law was passed in 2008. In 2005, LMF joined a statewide coalition to end discrimination based on gender identity and expression, thereby adding transgender rights to its awareness and advocacy campaign. Passing a marriage bill, however, remained its primary focus.  Love Makes a Family developed into three inter-related entities: LMF, Inc., incorporated as a 501(c)(4) in 2000; the LMF Political Action Committee (PAC),  established in 2002; and the LMF Foundation, incorporated as a 501(c)(3) in 2006.  After meeting its goals through community education, grassroots organizing, and legislative advocacy and lobbying, LMF, Inc. and LMF Foundation disbanded in 2009.  The LMF PAC continues to work for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality in Connecticut by supporting and working for pro equality candidates for elected office.</p>
         <p>In its first phase of work on second-parent adoption during 1999 and 2000, LMF Inc.'s informal Steering Committee was comprised of representatives from five statewide organizations: the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut, the Connecticut Coalition of LGBT Civil Rights, the Connecticut Conference of the United Church of Christ, the Connecticut State Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, and the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund. Once LMF, Inc. began the process of organizational incorporation and refocused its mission on marriage equality, the Steering Committee expanded, consisting of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer; representatives from six regional chapters; and representatives from six statewide organizations (the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women stepped down and Parents, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), True Colors and DemocracyWorks ultimately joined). This structure remained in place until 2006 when a more traditional Board of Directors structure was put in place.  In 2006, the LMF Foundation was incorporated as a 501(c) (3) that was primarily run by a board of directors, an executive director, and an associate director.  LMF, Inc. was originally run by volunteers but by 2008, it had grown to consist of several full and part-time staff, including administrators, field organizers, a lobbyist, a financial manager, an events coordinator, and a Web site designer.  While the organization benefited from the efforts of many individuals, several stand out for their length of service:  Anne Stanback served as president from 2000 to 2005 and executive director from 2006-2009; Betty Gallo served as lobbyist from 1999 to 2005 and 2007 to 2008; Alice Pritchard served in various roles from 2002 to 2008; Beverley Brakeman served as secretary from 2003 to 2007; Chelsea Turner served as a lobbyist from 2000 to 2004; and Carol Buckheit served in various roles, including  associate director and executive director, respectively, from 2005 to 2009.</p>
         <p>The organization accomplished its goals through community education, grassroots organizing, and legislative advocacy and lobbying.  LMF volunteers and staff trained and organized community volunteers; gave presentations; organized community forums, rallies, and public hearings; canvassed voters; commissioned research; managed a speakers' bureau; served as a clearinghouse on civil union and marriage information; and lobbied legislators.   LMF was recognized as a leader in the marriage equality movement.  Anne Stanback and LMF were recognized with several honors, including Stanback's induction into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame.</p>

               <p>The Administrative Records series is divided into seven sections: Executive Director's records, Associate Director's records, Field Organizer's records, Religious Organizer's records, Financial records, Printed material, and General resource files. 
 
The most substantive materials are found in the Executive Director's records, which document all aspects of the organization.  For example, the organization's history can be gleaned from bylaws, board minutes, and annual reports.  Lobbying, research, and advocacy activities pertaining to the same-sex marriage bill and same-sex marriage cases in various states can be found in the topical files under Legislative efforts.  The Associate Director was primarily responsible for public relations and communications and, as such, records on those topics, including press releases and materials documenting fundraising events, are found in that section.</p>
               <p>The records of the Field and Religious organizers provide a glimpse of LMF's field and specialized campaigns to gain support for their legislative agenda.    The Financial records consist of budgets, audits, and tax returns.  Of special note in the Printed material section are newspaper clippings covering the same-sex marriage movement in Connecticut and LMF's role in it from 2002 to 2009 and the "Love Makes  A Family: The LMF Testimonial Book" with personal statements from state residents.  Materials in the General resource files are of a more general nature and did not belong to any one person at LMF.</p>
               <p>Many of the events documented in Series I are also documented in Series II, Audiovisual Recordings and Photographs.  Researchers interested in a particular event should consult the listings for both series.</p>
