         <p>The papers of Richard Hans Douai Boerker consist of letters from prominent foresters, botanists, ecologists, and other scientists, and of a small amount of printed matter, including announcements for books by Boerker and others, newspaper clippings, programs, certificates, and other memorabilia. The correspondence, which is arranged chronologically, contains letters pertaining to forestry jobs held by Boerker, including letters of recommendation and letters from a variety of federal and state officials; pertaining to his study at the University of Michigan and the University of Nebraska; and pertaining to his writings on forestry. Many of the latter letters are acknowledgments of receipt of copies of his books and other publications from professionals, forestry societies, libraries, and universities in America and Europe. One of these, dated November 29, 1918, comes from Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
