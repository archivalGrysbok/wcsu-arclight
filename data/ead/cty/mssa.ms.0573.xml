Much of the material relates to Stokes's activities and involvement with various radical groups, including the American Communist Party and the Socialist Party. The correspondence reflects these involvements and contains many letters exchanged with American political radicals, labor leaders, and anarchists from the early 20th century. Also included are research materials of John M. Whitcomb relating to Rose Pastor Stokes.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Rose Pastor Stokes' papers consist of correspondence, 1905-1933; writings, including manuscripts and published material, 1900-1958; printed material, consisting mostly of newspaper clippings, 1904-1953; drawings, some of which were either exhibited or published, 1923-1932; and miscellaneous material involving Rose Pastor Stokes' literary interests and political activities, 1904-1944.</p>
         <p>Most of the correspondence relates either to Rose Pastor Stokes' political activities or to her literary endeavors, both of which are in general politically oriented. Correspondents of note include: Leonard Abbott, Alexander Bittleman, Eugene V. Debs, Max Eastman, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Henry Ford, Kahlil Gibran, Emmaus Goldman, Upton Sinclair, Margaret Sanger, and Oswald Garrison Villard. Correspondence with James Graham Phelps Stokes and Jerome Isaac Romaine, Rose Pastor Stokes' husbands, and Olive Tilford Dargan, author and close personal friend of Mrs. Stokes, is of particular importance in relation to Rose Pastor Stokes' personal life. Among the writings is a copy of her unfinished autobiography which spans the period from 1879 to 1905. In addition, there is interesting material about her activities before 1920 which includes information on her views on socialism, on her participation in several workers' strikes and in the campaign to distribute birth control information to the public, and on her activities in support of various radical leaders such as Patrick Quinlan, Emma Goldman, and Margaret Sanger.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Rose Pastor Stokes (1879-1933), born in Augustowe, Poland, immigrated to the United States in 1890. For the next twelve years she worked in a Cleveland cigar factory during the day and followed a program of self-education at night. In 1903 she moved to New York City and became a feature writer for the <title render="italic">
               Jewish Daily News
            </title>. Soon after her arrival in New York, she interviewed the young millionaire socialist, James Graham Phelps Stokes. Out of this interview grew the romance which culminated in their marriage July 18, 1905. In the years that followed, Rose Pastor Stokes became known as a radical and a political activist. Aligned with the socialist movement at the beginning of her career, she moved steadily to the left, ultimately becoming a member of the American Communist Party. Her increasingly radical activities led to an estrangement with her husband, however, and in 1925 Stokes obtained a divorce from his wife. Rose was married again in 1927 to Jerome Isaac Romaine, a communist activist. She died in Germany in 1933 while undergoing treatment for cancer.</p>
         <p>The following biographical sketch was written by John M. Whitcomb, who donated these papers to Yale. Additional information on Rose Pastor Stokes may be found in the <title render="italic">
               Dictionary of American Biography
            </title>.</p>
         <p>ROSE HARRIET PASTOR</p>
         <p>Born July 18, 1879 in Augustowe, Poland.</p>
         <p>Removed to London, England in 1882.</p>
         <p>Removed to Cleveland, Ohio, 1890.</p>
         <p>Removed to New York City in 1903; worked for JEWISH DAILY NEWS.</p>
         <p>Married to James Graham Phelps Stokes July 18, 1905.</p>
         <p>Divorced from Mr. Stokes in 1925.</p>
         <p>Remarried to Jerome Isaac Romaine in 1927.</p>
         <p>Died in Germany June 20, 1933.</p>
         <p>1. Childhood, years until marriage: Covered by uncompleted autobiography.</p>
         <p>2. Years 1903-1905 in New York City working for JEWISH DAILY NEWS; friendship formed with Israel Zevin of the newspaper staff.</p>
         <p>3. Early married life at "Caritas Island", Stamford and 88 Grove Street, New York City:</p>
         <p>Worked as a lecturer for the INTERCOLLEGIATE SOCIALIST SOCIETY which was organized by Jack London, Upton Sinclair and Graham Stokes; lecture tours went to many campuses of the United States and many friendships were formed during these travels (which were also conducted by Graham Stokes). As a result, many active socialists, some active anarchists and syndicalists (I.W.W.) were guests at "Caritas Island". Other visitors included liberals, literary figures of the time. A noteworthy guest was Maxim Gorky in 1906; he apparently came with Leroy and Miriam Finn Scott and Mrs. Scott acted as an interpreter because she, herself, was Russian.</p>
         <p>Graham Stokes "built with his own hands" two small houses on the island; these were for his friends from his days at the University Settlement House in New York City - Leroy Scott and English (William English) Walling. The Scott house is still standing. Walling was the joint founder of the N.A.A.C.P., following a trip to Springfield, Illinois, where he witnessed a Negro lynching.</p>
         <p>During these years Mrs. Stokes was active in organizing the hotel workers and dressmakers in N.Y.C. She was in demand as an agitational speaker. She was also very much involved in birth-control activities with Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman. As a prominent woman of the time, she was asked to join the HETERODOXY SOCIETY; this organization included many prominent women from cultural activities, and was not limited to people active in the socialist movement. Mrs. Stokes wrote several plays during these years; one of these, "The Woman Who Wouldn't", was presented by the Washington Square Players. She also contributed to such publications as <title render="italic">
               The Masses
            </title> (Editor, Max Eastman).</p>
         <p>During the year 1913, Mrs. Stokes worked in behalf of Patrick Quinlan who had been sentenced to prison during the Paterson (N.J.) strike. Persons of note associated with this period of Mrs. Stokes' life, letters from and to whom included in the collection were:</p>

         <p>Oswald Garrison Villard (Editor of the "Nation")</p>
         <p>4. Years 1917-1918, opposes entry of U.S. into World War I, sentenced to 10 year prison term for seditious utterances; Debs trial and sentence to prison.</p>
         <p>Mabel D. Curry (wife of Socialist professor in Terre Haute, Ind.; devoted friend of E. V. Debs whom she visited at Atlanta Penitentiary; RPS notes "Debs was in love with her")</p>
         <p>5. Years 1919-1933:</p>
         <p>Assisted in the organization of the Communist Party of U.S.; attended Bridgeman, Michigan secret convention in 1922, for which she was subject to prosecution under Michigan laws; delegate to the 4th Congress of the Comintern in Leningrad and Moscow, Nov.-Dec. 1922, at which she acted as "Reporter for the Negro Commission", presided over by G. Safarov - the documents covering this episode are in the collection, where Mrs. Stokes used the cover name of "Sacha".</p>
         <p>During this period Mrs. Stokes appears to have been an organizer and worker for the Communist Party. Her health began to fail and she withdrew from active party work about the time of her divorce in 1925. She became interested in drawing and exhibited at the SOCIETY OF INDEPENDENT ARTISTS in N.Y.C. in 1925; a portrait called "Anna" was done by her and illustrated in the catalogue of the exhibit; apparently she was encouraged by the artist Gibran, who wrote <title render="italic">
               The Prophet
            </title>.</p>
         <p>After her divorce from Graham Stokes, Mrs. Stokes lived, for a time, with Jeanette Pearl, who I believe to have once been the common-law wife of Louis Fraina, early leader of the Communist Party of the U.S. (Fraina changed his name to Lewis Corey and was, for many years, a professor at Antioch College, during which time he wrote a number of books on political and economic affairs.) In 1927, Mrs. Stokes married Jerome I. Romaine, a language teacher who later edited the Communist magazine, <title render="italic">
               Political Affairs
            </title> (he had once been the husband of Frances Winwar, Pulitzer Prize winner with her biographical novel <title render="italic">
               Poor Splendid Wings
            </title>). Romaine changed his name to Victor J. Jerome. Mrs. Stokes called herself Mrs. J. I. Romaine when she resided in New York City, but when living in her cottage in Westport, Connecticut, she retained the name Rose Pastor Stokes. In 1933 she died of cancer while being treated in a clinic in Germany. A memorial service, with political overtones, was held in New York City (see documents), under-written by many people of prominence.</p>
         <p>Jeanette Pearl</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The WRITINGS series consists of manuscripts and printed writings arranged alphabetically by subject.</p>
               <p>Among the manuscript materials there are several typewritten political tracts, copies of two speeches, a typewritten opinion on divorce and a short diary for 1933. Included in the printed material are feature columns written for the New York <title render="italic">
                     Jewish Daily News
                  </title>, several magazine articles, a few published poems, and some miscellaneous pamphlets.</p>
               <p>Of special interest in the series are a xerox copy of Rose Pastor Stokes' unfinished autobiography, which covers the period from 1879 to 1905, and a copy of <title render="italic">
                     Minority Report to be appended to Program and Methods of Approach
                  </title>. The latter is part of a report on the Negro question in America presented to the 4th Comintern Congress, Petrograd-Moscow, 1922. Rose Pastor Stokes was member of the reporting committee and wrote under the nom-de-plume "Sacha."</p>
               <p>Re: Rose Pastor Stokes Autobiography</p>
               <p>1. There is an incomplete first draft of the RPS autobiography and a photocopy of the same in the RPS Papers (MS 573, Series II, Box 6, Folders 6A and 6B).</p>
               <p>2. There is also an incomplete second draft of the RPS autobiography in the RPS Papers (Series II, folder 6C) which was removed from the Victor J. Jerome Papers. (A photocopy of this draft remains in the Jerome Papers.)</p>
               <p>3. The second draft differs somewhat from the first draft through p. 47 with different annotations, revisions, and in some cases, extra paragraphs - though the text is basically the same. From p. 48 to p. 111, the text is the same, though again with different annotations. From p. 111 to p. 119 the text varies somewhat. From p. 120-p. 132 the text of the two drafts is again the same, still however with different annotations, with the second draft being more heavily revised and annotated than the first. It is in this section that the second draft appears to be, in part, an actual revision of the first draft, incorporating to some degree revisions suggested in the latter.</p>
               <p>4. The first draft ends at p. 132; the second draft continues to p. 239 with page numbering gaps between pp. 143 and 178, and between pp. 195 and 220. It is difficult to tell whether these are substantive textual gaps or merely numbering gaps.</p>
               <p>5. It is obvious then that the second draft is the more complete and it is probably the latest revision of the autobiography.</p>
               <p>Further information about the autobiography is available in Appendix III in the finding aid in the repository. Consult Reference Archivist for assistance.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>PRINTED MATERIAL is arranged in three sections: <emph render="italic">Scrapbooks</emph>, <emph render="italic">Newspaper Clippings</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Pamphlets and Posters</emph>. Within each section, the folder titles are arranged alphabetically by subject. Material in the folders is arranged chronologically.</p>
               <p>The <emph render="italic">Scrapbook</emph> section contains the contents of two scrapbooks which have been removed from their bindings and placed in folders. The first scrapbook comprises newspaper clippings dated from November 1915 to January 1917. The bulk of the clippings are concerned with Rose Pastor Stokes' views on socialism, her activities in support of the dissemination of birth control information to the public, the Patrick Quinlan appeal in New Jersey, and several legal cases, including the trials of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Jessie Ashley, Margaret Sanger, and Emma Goldman. The second scrapbook contains newspaper clippings, dated 1916 to 1920, which concern the activities of Valdimir Resnikoff, a blind Russian baritone in whom Rose Pastor Stokes took great interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Newspaper Clippings</emph> include articles about the life - both public and private - of Rose Pastor Stokes, reviews of several of her plays, her translations of Morris Rosenfeld's poetry, and articles on a plagiarism controversy involving R.H. Davis' play <title render="italic">
                     The Guilty Man
                  </title>. Also included are articles on various medical discoveries, on several labor strikes, on the theater, and some miscellaneous material. Last, there is a folder of posthumous tributes to Rose Pastor Stokes.</p>
               <p>The third section, <emph render="italic">Pamphlets and Posters</emph>, consists of material from various political, social, and literary organizations spanning the period from 1903 to 1932.</p>
