         <p>The Albert Jay Nock Collection consists of the correspondence and writings of Albert Jay Nock, correspondence and writings of others about Nock, and some materials concerning Ruth Robinson, an intimate friend of Nock's. Much of the correspondence and writings is unpublished.</p>
         <p>The collection is arranged into three series, under the name of the person who collected and donated the papers.</p>
         <p>Series I, "Ruth Robinson," is the largest series in the collection and consists primarily of letters from Nock to Ruth Robinson. The series also includes letters to Nock from H. L. Mencken, Ellery Sedgwick, Brand Whitlock, Newton Baker, and Senator Robert Wagner.</p>
         <p>Series II, "Paul Palmer," was originally part of the Paul Palmer Papers, (See: Paul Palmer Papers, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University.) Palmer, who, like Nock, was a member of the Players' Club in New York, was the editor of <emph render="italic">The Mercury</emph> for which Nock wrote articles and the <emph render="italic">Reader's Digest</emph>. Among the notable correspondents in this series are Lawrence R. Abbott, Rutger B. Jewett, and Brand Whitlock.</p>
         <p>Series III, "Robert M. Crunden," Consists of papers collected by Crunden for a thesis he wrote as an undergraduate at Yale University, which was later published as a book, <emph render="italic">The Mind and Art of Albert Jay Nock</emph> (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1964). There is also a group of letters to Crunden from people who knew Nock. Notable correspondents in this group include: Harry Elmer Barnes, Jacques Barzun, John Dos Passos, Margaret Storrs Grierson, Hugh Mac Carran, Lewis Mumford, and Edmund A. Opitz.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Albert Jay Nock was a fiercely private man; biographical information is scarce indeed. He was born October 13, 1870 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (Nock himself claimed 1873 or, maybe 1874 as the year of his birth; it was, he thought, a matter of little consequence). His father, Joseph Albert Nock, was a clergyman in the Protestant Episcopal Church; his mother, Emma Sheldon Jay, was a descendant of the Rochellois Protestants who arrived in America in the late 1680's. Much of Nock's youth was spent in Alpena, Michigan, where his father had established a church.</p>
         <p>Nock attended St. Stephen's College (now Bard College) at Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, from which he received an A.B. degree in 1892. Evidence of Nock's activities between 1892 and 1898 are fragmentary at best. It appears that he took some graduate courses at the Berkeley Divinity School., which was then in Middletown, Connecticut. In any event, he was ordained to the ministry of the Episcopal Church in 1897 and was called to St. James Church, Titusville, Pennsylvania the following year. In Titusville, he met Agnes Grumbine (1876-1935), who he married on April 25, 1900. The marriage produced two sons, Francis Jay and Samuel Albert, but during the time Ruth Robinson knew him (from 1909 until his death in 1945), Nock rarely saw or mentioned his family.</p>
         <p>Nock left the active ministry late in 1909 to join the staff of <emph render="italic">American Magazine</emph>, where he proved his skill in editing as well as writing. In 1915 Crowell bought <emph render="italic">American Magazine</emph> and turned it into a popular magazine. Nock then joined the staff of the <emph render="italic">Nation</emph>, where his name appeared on the mast-head as an associate editor from July 27, 1918 to November 29, 1919. He left the <emph render="italic">Nation</emph> for the famous <emph render="italic">Freeman,</emph> which he co-edited, with Francis Neilson the British single-taxer, from 1920 until it ceased publication in 1924. By that time Nock was weary of editorial duties and never again accepted a regular editorial position. Instead, he devoted the rest of his life to travels and writing.</p>
         <p>Nock was a fierce champion of individualism and it is this credo which spurred his attacks on social and political institutions. In an autobiographical sketch he prepared for Paul Palmer, Nock wrote: "Responsibility to myself and for myself, yes. I am, as I have always been, proud to accept that, proud to assert it in the face of God, man, beast, or devil. But responsibility for anything beyond that I accept only on the strength of the most searching evidence; and I have a peculiarily resolute resentment against the impositions by State, Church, or social conventions of responsibilities which are purely aritificial in substance and fraudulent in intention."</p>
         <p>Nock was early associated with progressivism, but by the end of World War I he found himself labeled a conservative, a name he at first resisted, but finally accepted and defended until the end of his life. In fact, Nock was never really a reformer for he viewed attempts at conversion as a violation of the individual integrity of others. Similarly, he was pessimistic about the possibility of social change. True change, he believed, must be an aggregate of the voluntary changes in individuals.</p>
         <p>In addition to several volumes of collected essays, Nock's works include: <emph render="italic">Jefferson</emph>, a biography (1926), <emph render="italic">Francis Rabelais</emph> (1929), <emph render="italic">A Journey into Rabelais's France</emph> (1934), <emph render="italic">A Journal of These Days</emph> (1934), <emph render="italic">Our Enemy the State</emph> (1935), <emph render="italic">Free Speech and Plain Language</emph> (1937), and <emph render="italic">Henry George</emph> (1939). Nock's best-received book was his autobiography, <emph render="italic">Memoirs of a Superfluous Man</emph>(1943).</p>
         <p>* For additional biographical information, see <emph render="italic">The Superflous Anarchist: Albert Jay Nock</emph>, by Michel Wreszin (Providence, R. I.: Brown University Press, 1972).</p>

               <p>This series contains materials collected and donated by Ruth Robinson and is divided into two subsections: "Correspondence" and "Special Files."</p>
               <p>The bulk of the correspondence consists of letters to and from Nock, most of which are letters from Nock to Ruth Robinson. Letters are arranged alphabetically by the name of Nock's correspondent and chronologically within each folder. Typed copies of Nock's letters made by Ruth Robinson are filed immediately after the original letter. In addition, Robinson wrote editorial footnotes to the letters clarifying or elaborating upon unclear references. These will be found at the end of the correspondence. Numbers appearing on the typed copies of the letters mark the footnoted passages. Recording tapes used to make the typed copies of Nock's letters follow the editorial footnotes.</p>
               <p>There is a small section of correspondence by various persons addressed to Ruth Robinson or to Nock's sons, which were written after Nock's death. Most of these letters deal with the publication of <emph render="italic">Selected Letters of Albert Jay Nock</emph> or are about various writings about Nock. Among the correspondents in this section are: Bernard Iddings Bell, William Harlowe Briggs, Frank Chodorov, George Libaire, Robert M. Thornton, and Nock's two sons, Francis Jay and Samuel Albert Nock.</p>
               <p>"Special Files" consists of two published articles by Nock; the November, 1944 issue of <emph render="italic">Encore</emph>, for which Nock was the guest editor; printed materials about Nock and his writings; photos and autobiographical notes by Ruth Robinson; and some of the original pen and ink drawings done by Robinson for Nock's <emph render="italic">Journey into Rabelais's France</emph>. In addition, there are printed materials about the publication of <emph render="italic">The Freeman</emph>, guest lists, and programs for dramatic productions by the Player's Club, of which Nock was a member.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series contains materials collected and donated by Paul Palmer, Nock's friend and associate. The series is divided into three subsections: "Correspondence," "Writings," and "Printed Matter."</p>
               <p>"Correspondence" is arranged alphabetically by the name of the correspondent and chronologically within each folder. Approximately half of this section consists of correspondence between Palmer and Nock; the remainder, with the exception of two third-party letters, one addressed to Ruth Robinson and the other to Palmer, are letters from various people to Nock.</p>
               <p>"Writings" contains manuscripts by Nock, both published and unpublished, and printed articles by Nock, some of which are unsigned. The manuscripts are arranged alphabetically by subject (most do not have titles); the printed articles are arranged alphabetically by title, or, if untitled, by type, e.g., reviews.</p>
               <p>"Printed Matter" contains published material about Nock and his writings and is arranged alphabetically by type. Photographs of Nock are included in this section.</p>

               <p>This series contains material collected by Robert M. Crunden for an undergraduate thesis at Yale University, which he later published as a book, <emph render="italic">The Mind and Art of Albert Jay Nock</emph> (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1964). The series consists of three subsections: "Correspondence," "Writings," and "Special Files."</p>
               <p>"Correspondence" includes copies of letters or excerpts from letters written by Nock to various people and one letter to Nock from Ellery Sedgwick. The originals of these letters are in the possession of Francis Jay and Samuel Albert Nock. The balance of this section consists of replies to Crunden's requests for information from people who knew Nock. The copies of Nock's correspondence are arranged alphabetically by the name of the recipient (except for the Sedgwick letter); the Crunden correspondence is arranged alphabetically by the name of the writer of the letter.</p>
               <p>"Writings" consists of materials both by and about Nock. Writings by Nock include published articles, a manuscript autobiographical sketch Nock wrote for Paul Palmer, an unpublished manuscript journal of Nock's travels in Europe in 1935, three short stories (only one of which has been published), and the commencement address which Nock delivered at his graduation from St. Stephen's College in 1892. These are followed by writings about Nock, which are arranged alphabetically by author. Anonymous articles and all of the reviews are at the end of this section. Of special interest are the biographical sketches of Nock by Paul Palmer and Ruth Robinson.</p>
               <p>"Special Files" contains printed materials not directly related to Nock and miscellaneous notes written by Ruth Robinson after Nock's death.</p>
