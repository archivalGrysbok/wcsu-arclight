         <p>Edward Clark Street was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 10, 1874. After receiving his B.A. from Yale University in 1898, he returned to Illinois where he completed medical school at Northwestern University (M.D. 1901). Following additional training in Europe, Streeter practiced medicine in Chicago and Boston. During World War I, Streeter served in France. He joined the faculty of the Harvard Medical School in 1921 and continued there until 1933. He also served as visiting professor of the history of medicine at Yale University from 1929 until 1933. Streeter collected extensively in the fields of medical literature, weights and measures, and pharmaceutical objects. He donated his collection to the Yale Medical Library in conjunction with the library's opening in 1941 and served as the collection's first curator. He continued to donate materials to the collection until his death on July 17, 1947, in Stonington, Connecticut.</p>
