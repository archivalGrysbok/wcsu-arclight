         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>William Sloane Coffin, Jr. was born June 1, 1924, in New York City. He attended Deerfield Academy and Phillips Academy Andover before beginning his studies at Yale University in 1942. After one year at Yale, Coffin joined the U.S. Army, in which he served until 1947, when he returned to Yale, graduating with a B.A. in 1949. He went on to study for a year at Union Theological Seminary before joining the Central Intelligence Agency in 1950. In 1953, Coffin began studies at the Yale Divinity School, which he completed in 1956, when he was ordained into the Presbyterian ministry. Coffin spent successive years as the chaplain of Phillips Academy and Williams College before returning to Yale to serve as chaplain from 1957 to 1975. While chaplain at Yale, Coffin became a public figure active in the civil rights movement and protests of U.S. military actions in Vietnam. Coffin served as senior minister of Riverside Church in New York City from 1977 to 1987, when he became president of SANE/FREEZE. Coffin retired to Vermont in the mid-1990s, but remained active as a teacher, lecturer, and writer. He died on April 12, 2006, in Strafford, Vermont.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>William Sloane Coffin, Jr. was born on June 1, 1924, in New York City to William Sloane Coffin, Sr. and Catherine Butterfield Coffin. After the death of Coffin's father in 1933, the family moved to Carmel, California, where William attended public school until the ninth grade, when he attended Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts. He spent the following year in Paris with his family, studying to be a concert pianist with Nadia Boulanger. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Coffins returned to the United States, and Coffin completed his high school education at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 1942.</p>
         <p>Coffin attended Yale University School of Music for one year before enlisting in the United States Army. Coffin served in the army until 1947, rising to the rank of captain while working as a liaison with the French and Soviet armies. He returned to the university upon his discharge and received his B.A. in 1949. Coffin spent the next year studying at Union Theological Seminary, then joined the Central Intelligence Agency for a three year period. Coffin returned to Yale once again in 1953, this time attending the divinity school, from which he received a B.D. in 1956. That same year he was ordained as Presbyterian minister. Coffin then served as chaplain of Phillips Andover Academy and Williams College in successive one year periods, before returning to Yale in 1958 to succeed Sidney Lovett as university chaplain, a position he held until 1975.</p>
         <p>While chaplain at Yale, Coffin emerged as a public figure involved in numerous prominent events, activities, and organizations. He became involved in international relief work, beginning with Operation Crossroads Africa. On behalf of that group, he led a group of students to Guinea in the summer of 1960. The following year, Coffin was appointed to the President's Advisory Committee on the Peace Corps and established its training program. He trained the first group of Peace Corps volunteers in Puerto Rico during the summer of 1961.</p>
         <p>Coffin also became a prominent figure in the civil rights movement in the early 1960s. He was one of the "Freedom Riders," a group of black and white activists who rode interstate buses in the South to challenge segregation laws. Following one of these rides in May of 1961, he was arrested in Montgomery, Alabama, along with six other demonstrators, and charged with disturbing the peace. He was also arrested on several other occasions for direct actions against segregation laws. In addition to his direct participation in civil rights protests in the South, Coffin recruited and coordinated the work of many northern activists, particularly white students, and he was also a member of the Connecticut Advisory Board of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.</p>
         <p>With the escalation of military actions in Vietnam, Coffin became heavily involved in the protests against the war. His activism began in 1965 with the formation of Americans For Re-appraisal of Far Eastern Policy, a group founded by Coffin and Allard Lowenstein that pushed for United States recognition of the People's Republic of China, the admission of China into the United Nations, and a cease-fire in Vietnam. Later that year, Coffin joined with a group of religious leaders, including John Bennett, Abraham Heschel, and Daniel Berrigan, to form the National Emergency Committee of Clergy Concerned About Vietnam. Coffin was named executive secretary of the organization. Initially, the group adopted a relatively moderate stance, recommending traditional political action and persuasion to affect change in U.S. policy toward Vietnam.</p>
         <p>As the war in Vietnam escalated and lay people became interested in the work of the group, it changed its name to Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). CALCAV organized mobilizations, supported conscientious objectors and acts of civil disobedience, and urged members to offer draft resisters sanctuary in churches and synagogues. During this time, Coffin became a frequent speaker at anti-war rallies and a highly public figure. At an October 1967 protest in Boston, over 1000 draft resisters turned in their draft cards at a church service led by Coffin. Later that month, he and a number of other activists who had collected cards throughout the country, presented them to officials at the Department of Justice in Washington. As a result of these actions, Coffin was indicted along with Benjamin Spock, Marcus Raskin, Mitchell Goodman, and Michael Ferber on charges of conspiracy to aid draft resisters. They were convicted in 1968, but the charges were dropped in 1970 after the verdict was overturned on appeal. Coffin continued to protest against the war, and even traveled to North Vietnam in 1972 to accompany three released prisoners on their trip back to the United States. In the war's final stages and after its end, Coffin was an outspoken proponent of the granting of amnesty for draft resisters.</p>
         <p>Throughout his tenure at Yale, Coffin's actions met with mixed reviews among Yale students, administrators, and alumni. Many older alumni and other conservative Yale factions called for his resignation or removal. While Kingman Brewster, Yale's president, disagreed with Coffin's methods of protest, particularly his stand on and involvement in civil disobedience, he stood behind Coffin's rights to free speech and held that Coffin's influence on Yale was generally positive. Coffin left Yale in December 1975, citing the need to remove himself from the academy in order to work on a global level for social justice, disarmament, and an end to hunger.</p>
         <p>After leaving Yale, Coffin published his memoirs, <title render="italic">
               Once to Every Man,
            </title> and in November 1977, he became senior minister of Riverside Church in New York City. While at Riverside, Coffin dedicated himself to a variety of human rights causes, including world hunger, disarmament, homelessness, and poverty, among others. In 1979, he made headlines again by traveling to Iran to hold Christmas services for hostages being held in the American Embassy. In 1987, he left Riverside to become president of SANE/FREEZE, which was renamed Peace Action in 1993.</p>
         <p>Coffin married Eva Rubinstein, a ballet dancer and the daughter of Arthur Rubinstein, in 1956 and they had three children: Amy, Alexander, and David. They were divorced in 1968. Coffin re-married in 1969, to Harriet Gibney; they divorced shortly after he left Yale. Coffin's third wife is Randy Wilson Coffin. After becoming president emeritus of SANE/FREEZE in the mid-1990s, Coffin moved to Vermont and continued to teach and lecture. He died of congestive heart failure at his home in Strafford, Vermont, on April 12, 2006.</p>

               <p>Correspondence is arranged alphabetically within four sections: General, Family, Public Opinion Mail, and Speaking Engagements. Other correspondence of a topical nature exists in the Subject Files, Writings, and Yale Files series.</p>
               <p>General correspondence consists of letters exchanged between Coffin and civil rights leaders, Vietnam War and peace activists, university administrators, religious figures, politicians, students, and other individuals. The leading civil rights figures that corresponded with Coffin include Ralph Abernathy, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King, but the correspondence is not particularly substantive. There is a substantial amount of correspondence with individuals involved in the anti-war movement, including Daniel Berrigan, Robert McAfee Brown, Rennie Davis, Richard Neuhaus, Marcus Raskin, Benjamin Spock, and Norman Thomas (see the description of Series II for a more detailed explanation of other correspondence and material related to the civil rights and anti-war movement). Letters between Coffin and several Yale University officials and faculty members, such as Kingman Brewster, A. Whitney Griswold, Reuben Holden, Louis Pollak, Richard Sewall, Gaddis Smith, and Norman Buck comprise another sizable portion of the series. The Brewster correspondence provides a particularly rich picture of Coffin's tenure as chaplain at Yale and of the relationship between these two high profile individuals. The section also includes a small amount of substantive correspondence with Yale students such as Joseph Lieberman, whose one letter describes his decision to decline admission to Skull and Bones, and Strobe Talbott, who writes detailed descriptions of his inner city work in Cleveland in the late 1960s (see Series III for other Yale related material). There is correspondence with religious leaders such as Reinhold Niebuhr, John C. Bennett, Sidney Lovett, and James Robinson and with politicians and public figures such as Jeb Magruder, George McGovern, Ralph Nader, Fred Rogers, and Studs Terkel. The McGovern correspondence includes documentation of Coffin's efforts on behalf of McGovern's presidential bid. Correspondence with colleagues in Outward Bound and the Peace Corps, including Fred Lanoue, Joshua Miner, Bill Moyers, Sargent Shriver, and Spencer Summers comprises another significant portion of the section. Other correspondence and documentation of these organizations can also be found in Series II.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the Family correspondence consists of incoming letters to Coffin from an earlier era in his life. Most of the letters from his mother Catherine Coffin and sister Margot Coffin date from the time Coffin served in the military, during and after World War II. Many of these letters were addressed to both Coffin and his brother Ned. Family correspondence also includes a small number of letters from Coffin's first wife, Eva, primarily written while Coffin was spending a summer in Guinea working with Operation Crossroads Africa volunteers.</p>
               <p>Public Opinion Mail consists of incoming and outgoing correspondence that comments on his public actions. These letters are arranged under the following topical headings: General, "Appeal for Theological Affirmation," Conspiracy Trial, Freedom Rides, and <title render="italic">
                     Glamour
                  </title> magazine article, each of which includes anti- and pro-Coffin folders. Although there are many more supportive letters, the critical correspondence is more dramatic and Coffin was more likely to answer his critics than supporters. The Conspiracy Trial correspondence comprises the most easily identified material in the collection that relates to Coffin's arrest, indictment, conviction, and successful appeal on charges of conspiring to aid draft resisters. The Freedom Rides correspondence contains similar types of materials.</p>
               <p>Speaking Engagements correspondence is arranged chronologically intwo sub-sections: Accepts and Declines. This section documents the great demand for Coffin as a public speaker and can be used to trace his appearances around the United States and abroad.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by a mixture of corporate and topical headings largely derived from Coffin's own folder titles. It includes a wide range of documentation of the movements, organizations, and events in which Coffin participated. Files include correspondence, printed matter, clippings, ephemera and other materials collected and created by Coffin. Although the contents vary widely, a number of important themes are discernible in the series including relief work, race and civil rights, Vietnam protests, amnesty for draft resisters, and disarmament. Many of these themes are also evident in other parts of the collection, particularly Series I and Series IV.</p>
               <p>Most of the documentation of Coffin's efforts to organize and supply relief work to other countries can be found under Operation Crossroads Africa and Peace Corps. The Operation Crossroads Africa files contain correspondence with James Robinson and other Crossroads Africa officials and participants. Other papers that illustrate Coffin's commitment to relief work in Africa can be found in the Africa file and American Committee on Africa file. The Peace Corps material includes correspondence with Sargent Shriver, Spencer Summers, William Haddad, Joshua Miner, and Bill Moyers, among others, and documents Coffin's early influence on the program. Materials filed under Outward Bound document Coffin's connection with that program and his use of it as a model for training Peace Corps volunteers. The series also includes material relating to Coffin's work with the Commission on Youth Services Program and the National Service Program.</p>
               <p>The nine "Race relations" folders comprise the most substantive materials relating to Coffin's civil rights work and include documentation from a wide variety of groups and individuals. The files predominantly contain correspondence and collected materials that document Coffin's organizing efforts and views on race, as well as those of others.Organizations documented include the Congress On Racial Equality, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, Northern Student Movement, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Coffin also kept separate folders of materials relating to several of these groups and they are listed under their corporate names. Cross references have been provided. The series includes other materials relating to race and the civil rights movement under the following headings: Civil rights march on Washington, DC; Freedom rides; and United States Commission on Civil Rights, Connecticut Advisory Board.</p>
               <p>Coffin's anti-war efforts comprise another major part of this series, spread over many overlapping files. The most voluminous and substantive material can be found under the headings Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV); Americans for Reappraisal of Far-Eastern Policy (AFRFEP); Draft resistance; Conscientious objectors; Resist: A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority; and Vietnam Summer. Rather than representing the inner workings of the organization Coffin helped to found, the CALCAV files serve as more of a topical file of Coffin's anti-war activities. The AFRFEP materials document the work of an earlier group formed to examine and protest United States foreign policy in the Far East. The Draft resistance materials include correspondence, flyers, publications, and other documents of the work of Coffin and others to contest the conscription of young men into the military. These materials include some documentation of Coffin's indictment and trial on charges of conspiring to aid draft resisters. Other documentation relating to this case can be found under the William Sloane Coffin Jr. Defense Fund. A large portion of the Draft resistance papers also consists of letters written to Coffin from individual resisters. These letters document their decisions, efforts, and problems. Documentation under the heading Conscientious objectors includes correspondence of a similar nature, which chronicles Coffin's work to secure conscientious objector status for a variety of individuals. The "Resist" folders document Coffin's collaborative effort to produce the eloquent justification for the use of civil disobedience to protest the war. Vietnam Summer material provides a significant view of the workings and accomplishments of the group, through reports, project profiles, correspondence and memoranda, and posters. A large amount of collected materials, largely newspaper and magazine articles, that provide background information on the anti-war movement have been filed under the generic heading Vietnam. Other folders that contain documentation of protest movements against the Vietnam War can be found under American Friends Service Committee; Committee of Responsibility to Save War Burned and War Injured Vietnamese Children; Fellowship of Reconciliation; Midwest Committee for Draft Counseling; Mobilizations; National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam; New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam; Peace groups; and United States Study Team on Religious and Political Freedom in Vietnam.</p>
               <p>Related to his anti-Vietnam war work, the series also includes significant documentation of Coffin's involvement in the amnesty and disarmament movements. The Amnesty for draft resisters materials hold a variety of information on this movement, much of it collected by Coffin rather than created by him. With the end of the Vietnam War, Coffin's efforts progressed into the disarmament movement. His efforts in this area are documented under the following headings: International Hearing on Nuclear Weapons and Disarmament; and SANE (National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy). Papers documenting the Voter's Pledge Campaign comprise the bulk of the SANE materials, which do not contain records from his tenure as president of the organization. Researchers should consult the Audiovisual materials for access to nearly thirty audiocassette recordings of presentations made at the Waging War in the Nuclear Age Conference held in 1987 as part of the Riverside Church Disarmament Program.</p>
               <p>Several relatively minor themes can be discerned throughout the remainder of the series. In the course of his peace and disarmament work, Coffin collected papers relating to several southeast Asian and Latin American countries. These materials generally date from the late 1970s and 1980s and are listed under country names, as well as the following headings: Campaign for Civil Rights; Center for the Study of the Americas; Institute of Social Studies; National Appeal for Justice in Latin America; "Sanctuary and the Law: A Guide for Congregations;" and Solidarity Committee with the Argentine People. A substantial amount of documentation, dating from the 1970s, exists for the Institute for World Order. Coffin's involvement in campus ministry groups and other religious organizations can be found under the Fund for Theological Education (Rockefeller Foundation), National Association of College and University Chaplains, National Campus Ministry Association, National Council of Churches of Christ, and New Haven Council of Churches. Finally, the series includes material relating to local social and political groups based in New Haven, including the Black Panther Party, Black Women's Boycott, Community Progress, Inc., and New Haven Women's Liberation.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Yale University Files consist of materials specific to Coffin's position as Yale chaplain and as pastor of Church of Christ in Yale University. The series is arranged alphabetically. Materials related to his years as a student in Yale College and Yale Divinity School can be found in Series IV and Series V.</p>
               <p>The majority of the series concerns Church of Christ in Yale University. In addition to General files that document day to day administration of the church, the section includes a considerable amount of correspondence with individuals who served as guest preachers. While most of this correspondence is routine, covering travel and other details, some of it does relate to the content and themes of sermons preached at Battell Chapel. Coffin's work with undergraduate deacons is documented among the files relating to the Board of Undergraduate Deacons.</p>
               <p>A substantial amount of documentation regarding Yale organizations and groups, such as Dwight Hall, Yale Hunger Action Project, Yale in China, and Yale Religious Ministry, comprise another important part of the series. Files under the heading of Denominational groups document Coffin's work with different religious groups on campus.</p>
               <p>The Yale files also include a small amount of topical material relating to local protest and political activities, such as the Local 35 strike, May Day, Yale Draft Refusal, and Yale Non-Faculty Action Committee.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged in six sections: Books; Letters to the editor; Notes and quotations; Sermons, speeches, and interviews; Student; and Topical.</p>
               <p>The Books section includes a draft and reviews of Coffin's autobiography, <title render="italic">
                     Once to Every Man: A Memoir
                  </title>, as well as correspondence relating to its publication. The Books section also containsa proposal and correspondence relating to a never completed book to have been titled "To Walk the Earth Like Men."</p>
               <p>Notes and quotations include a small amount of material Coffin used in other writings.</p>
               <p>Sermons, speeches, and interviews are arranged chronologically and cover a variety of topics. They reflect the major themes of the collection found in Series I and II and document Coffin's religious, social, and political views and activities. Of particular note is an interview of Coffin conducted by Nat Hentoff, which appeared in the August 1968 issue of <title render="italic">
                     Playboy
                  </title>. Coffin's speeches during late 1967 and his appearance with Benjamin Spock on <title render="italic">
                     Meet the Press
                  </title> in early 1968 document the issues surrounding the his 1967 arrest for conspiring to aid draft resisters. Recordings of many of the public appearances are in the Audiovisual materials series, and cross references have been provided.</p>
               <p>The Student writings section covers a breadth of topics and consists of papers Coffin wrote for undergraduate courses in Yale College and graduate courses at Union Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School. It also includes materials from Russian lessons he took while in the military to prepare for his position as liaison to the Soviet army.</p>
               <p>The Topical section includes published and unpublished articles, essays, notes, and other types of writings grouped by subject, according to Coffin's own arrangement scheme. The writings cover social, political, and religious themes, and several of the topics overlap with materials found in Series II, including amnesty, civil rights, draft cards, race, and Vietnam.</p>

               <p>The series contains photographs, clippings, family materials, travel information, and other materials that provide biographical information and documentation of Coffin's personal and family life. The series is arranged alphabetically. The photographs consist of a small number of portraits of Coffin that were routinely supplied to press outlets doing stories related to his work. Biographical information includes press releases provided by the Faculty Information Service of the Yale News Bureau, as well as completed questionnaires for class and reunion books. Clippings provide a representation of Coffin's activities but are by no means comprehensive. Other news coverage of Coffin's activities can be found under topical headings in previous series.</p>
               <p>A small amount of material documenting Coffin's life prior to becoming chaplain at Yale comprises another portion of the series. This is found in a scrapbook from his year in Paris in the late 1930s, his Military papers, and the Yale Glee Club European tour materials. Coffin's "Statement of Faith" provides an articulation of his theological views during the early years of his career as a minister.</p>

               <p>The accession includes a master, duplicating master, and use copy videotape recording of a talk given by Coffin at the Yale University Library on February 24, 2003. The title of the talk, "War is a Coward's Escape from the Problems of Peace" was derived from a quote by Thomas Mann. The talk was given in support of a library exhibit on the antiwar movement that featured Coffin's papers. Coffin gives his perspective on the upcoming war in Iraq and reflects on his experiences in the antiwar movement in the 1960s.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The accession is arranged in four sections: Correspondence; Printed materials and clippings; Topical; and Writings. The materials supplement the main accession and add significant documentation on Coffin's years as senior minister of Riverside Church. Highlighted in the materials is an extensive collection of sermons, both from Riverside and Yale University's Battell Chapel. Though donated by Coffin, these materials were transferred to Yale after the original accession by Warren Goldstein, who used them in researching his biography of Coffin.</p>
               <p>Correspondence is divided into two subsections: general and public opinion mail. General correspondence is arranged chronologically and contains both professional and personal materials. Public opinion mail regarding Vietnam and the freedom ride supplements material in the main accession. Correspondence also contains one folder of unidentified correspondence, mainly written in Russian.</p>
               <p>Printed materials and clippings are arranged chronologically and contain primarily articles about Coffin.</p>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically, Topical files consist of correspondence, clippings, writings, and other materials on particular subjects. Coffin's anti-war activities are documented in nine folders filed under the heading Vietnam War, as well as in files on Americans for Reappraisal of Far Eastern Policy, Amnesty, Capitol rotunda sit-in, Clergy and Laymen Concerned, and the Boston 5 trial. The Boston 5 trial is particularly well documented with clippings, some correspondence, and substantial amounts of legal materials. Topical files also cover Coffin's years as senior minister of Riverside Church and document several causes he fought for while at Riverside. Materials on these subjects can be found in folders under the headings of Riverside Church, Central America, Disarmament, Homosexuality, Iran, Iran-Contra scandal, and South Africa. The accession also contains a small amount of SANE/FREEZE material, which include printed matter, public statements, minutes of meetings, and other professional materials. The SANE/FREEZE materials also include three folders of correspondence congratulating Coffin on becoming president of the organization.</p>
               <p>The Writings comprise the largest part of the accession and are divided into nine subsections: Books; Essays and articles; Interviews; Notes; Prayers; Quotations; Sermons; Speeches; and Writings by others. Books includes manuscript drafts from <title render="italic">
                     The Courage to Love
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Once to Every Man
                  </title> and edited, printed pages from <title render="italic">
                     Living the Truth in a World of Illusions
                  </title>. The vast majority of the subsection consists of multiple drafts of <title render="italic">
                     Once to Every Man
                  </title>, which supplement materials found in the main accession.</p>
               <p>Essays and articles date to the Yale and Riverside years and consist of Coffin's publications and manuscripts of published and unpublished works. Where known, the publication in which the articles appeared has been noted. These writings cover a variety of Coffin's main interests, including civil rights, the Vietnam War, and disarmament. Interviews is comprised of the transcripts from nine interviews dating between 1959 and 1996 and are arranged chronologically. The accession also contains a large number of Coffin's Prayers, mainly from the Yale years. The majority of prayers are divided between dated and undated, but where the original folder distinguished specific types of prayers, that distinction has been maintained with separate folder headings.</p>
               <p>Sermons and Speeches comprise the largest two sub-sections of Writings and the division between them is somewhat artificial. When the document itself gave no differentiation, the tendency has been to place the item in speeches rather than sermons. Sermons comprise the majority of the writings and they are arranged chronologically and are subdivided based on Coffin's primary occupation at the time. The accession has only three sermons from Andover and Williams, but contains many sermons from Yale, and nearly every Coffin sermon at Riverside between 1980 and 1986, with a still substantial number of sermons from his other years there. Quotations of first lines of a sermon have been included for those lacking a title. Most of the Yale and Riverside sermons were produced for public distribution, but many also include or only contain Coffin's edited manuscript version. Coffin's sermons tend to focus on social justice causes, including civil rights, the Vietnam War, homophobia, disarmament, and the Iranian Revolution, among many others. The sermons demonstrate the profound influence on Coffin of theologians like Reinhold Neibuhr and Paul Tillich. Speeches are arranged chronologically and consist mainly of Coffin's original manuscripts. Where known, the location of the speeech has been included in the finding aid.</p>
               <p>Writings by others are divided between essays and articles, sermons, and speeches. They are arranged alphabetically by last name within each of these headings.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This accession is arranged in seven sections: Correspondence; Personal and family; Printed materials and clippings; Topical; Writings; Audiotapes; and Videotapes. There is also a small amount of oversize material. The materials supplement the previous accessions by documenting Coffin's "semi-retirement" during the 1990s and 2000s and by providing materials about his personal life as a father, son, friend, and minister, during the 1930s through the 1980s.</p>
               <p>Correspondence is divided into three sections: general, family, and geographical. General correspondence is arranged alphabetically and is both personal and professional in nature. It primarily dates to either Coffin's time in the army or the 1990s and 2000s. The section includes correspondence with William F. Buckley, Jr., George Bailey, Manya Piskounoff, Elaine Manson, Bill Moyers, Michael Ferber, and particularly touching sympathy cards from Ted Kennedy and Lou Pollak. Following the general correspondence is a section of correspondence from or to relatives of Coffin, which chiefly date to World War II or the CIA years, with an additional letter from 1983. The majority of the family correspondence consists of the very personal letters to or from Coffin's mother, Catherine Butterfield Coffin. The largest part of the correspondence section is arranged by geographic locality and dates almost entirely to the 1990s and 2000s. Correspondence in the geographical organization is primarily public opinion mail or letters regarding speaking engagements, with a small amount of other personal material. This material was transferred from Coffin's assistant and its original order has, for the most part, been maintained.</p>
               <p>Personal and family is subdivided between materials about William Sloane Coffin, Jr., William Sloane Coffin, Sr. (Coffin's father), and Catherine Butterfield Coffin (Coffin's mother). The William Sloane Coffin, Jr. documents are from his youth, 1946, and 1983. Materials from Coffin's youth include drawings, report cards, medical reports, and a homemade serial created by the Coffin children while living in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The 1946 document is Coffin's translation into Russian of Bernard Pares' <emph render="italic">History of Russia</emph>, which Coffin used as a means to learn the language. The material from 1983 consists primarily of notes of condolence following the death of Coffin's son, Alexander, who died in a car accident on January 11, 1983. There are also twenty-six photographs in this section. Photographs are mostly unidentified and undated, though a few seem to date to the 1940s, one to 1972, and the rest to the mid 1980s and later. Many are low quality, home photographs. The identified photographs include pictures of Coffin with Andy Harris (Pacific School of Religion) and Cathy Thaler (Mayor); Gregory Sloane Coffin; Eric Gabriel Coffin; Coffin and his wife, Randy, with Bruce Brackenridge; Coffin at Peace Week at Western Michigan University; Coffin at Sun City; and Coffin at an event about Nicaragua. The photograph from 1972 is from Coffin's trip to Hanoi. Included in the picture are David Dellinger, Cora Weiss, and Richard Falk, as well as three unidentified individuals.</p>
               <p>The William Sloane Coffin, Sr. materials consist of a biography by his wife, Catherine Butterfield Coffin, some writings, and a passport. The materials date to World War I and the 1930s. The Catherine Butterfield Coffin materials include a small amount of correspondence regarding her death in December, 1982. They also include documents regarding the neutrality of Switzerland, where members of the Coffin family were living at the beginning of World War II. Additionally, there is a collection of letters and diary entries, dating to 1918, but apparently typed at a much later date.</p>
               <p>Printed materials and clippings are arranged chronologically and contain primarily articles about Coffin.</p>
               <p>Topical files consist of correspondence, clippings, writings, and other materials on particular subjects and are arranged alphabetically by subject. Topics found in this accession mainly date to Coffin's years at Riverside and later. The one major exception is the large amount of World War II military materials from Coffin's training to become an officer in the United States Army. Other topics of interest include Central America, homosexuality, and sanctuary. Materials relating to <title render="italic">
                     Christianity and Crisis
                  </title> generally refer to Coffin's membership on the board of directors.</p>
               <p>Writings supplement similar sections in the previous accessions by adding materials from Coffin's later years. The section is divided into four subsections: essays and short articles, prayers, speeches, and writings by others. Essays and short articles are arranged alphabetically by title and consist mainly of writings for periodicals. The accession contains a very small amount of prayers, found in one folder. Speeches are arranged chronologically and include sermons. Many are from lectures delivered across the country and almost all date to the 1990s or later. Writings by others are divided into essays and short articles and speeches. They are arranged alphabetically by last name.</p>
               <p>The accession includes some sixty, chronologically-arranged audiotapes. They are divided into two subsections based on whether or not Coffin is a primary speaker. A large number are recordings of sermons delivered at Riverside Church and where possible, a cross reference to the written sermon has been included. Other recordings are of interviews of Coffin or speeches by Coffin.</p>
               <p>Videotapes are arranged chronologically and cover a wide variety of topics. Specific information about individual content and quality has been noted in bracket statements.</p>

               <p>This accession was transferred from the basement of Battell Chapel and contains a wide variety of materials almost entirely dating between 1966 and 1968. Materials are arranged alphabetically by topic and folder headings are largely derived from the original folders. Most of the materials are clippings, pamphlets, and other collected material. There is very little correspondence and it is all found within topical folders. The small amount of writings and sermons are listed under those headings.</p>
               <p>Materials in this accession relate primarily to issues of importance to Coffin in the late 1960s, especially the Vietnam War. Materials on Coffin's anti-Vietnam War activism can be found in the following folders: American Clergymen's Committee for Vietnamese War Relief; Boston 5 Trial; Cambodia; Canada; Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors; civil disobedience; Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam; draft; Interfaith Council for Peace; Johnson, Lyndon B.; Lynd, Staughton; religious groups on Vietnam; and Vietnam. Another topic relatively well documented in the accession is civil rights. Materials relating to civil rights can be found under the folder headings black power, civil rights, Mississippi, National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons, and W. E. B. DuBois Clubs.</p>
