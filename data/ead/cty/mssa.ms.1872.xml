         <p>Vincent Joseph Scully was born in 1920 in New Haven, Connecticut. He attended Yale University, where he earned a B.A. (1940), an M.A. (1947), and Ph.D. (1949) in art history. He has been a member of the Yale faculty since 1947, where he is a Sterling Professor Emeritus of the History of Art. He also teaches classes at the University of Miami.</p>
         <p>Vincent Scully was influenced by French-school art historians during his studies at Yale and developed an appreciation of contemporary architects Louis Kahn and Frank Lloyd Wright. He has encouraged "other modernism," promoting the opening of architectural theory to psychological and archetypal analysis. Among his students were the founders of the New Urbanism, which promotes planned growth in cities and towns.</p>
         <p>Vincent Scully was awarded a Fulbright scholarship in 1950. Two academic professorships at Yale have been established in his honor. In 1999, the National Building Museum in Washington established the Vincent Scully Prize to honor individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the built environment through scholarship, research, writing or professional practice. In 2005 Scully was awarded the National Medal of the Arts, honored by the National Endowment for the Arts as "one of the nation's foremost architectural historians." Among his many publications are <title type="simple" render="italic">
