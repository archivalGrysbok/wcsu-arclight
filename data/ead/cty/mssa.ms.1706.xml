         <p>The Frank Donner papers document the history and use of political surveillance in the United States, primarily from the late 1940s through the early 1990s. The collection also generally serves as a resource for researchers studying the history of the twentieth century American left, civil liberties struggles and the lawyers who fought them, and the American political intelligence establishment. The papers reflect Donner's political and intellectual work and interests in civil liberties, progressive political movements, and the government's use of surveillance and informers. The collection includes extensive documentation on every major political informer from the anti-Communist wave of the 1950s to the social protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The informer files include biographical information, court documents and testimonies, and interview transcripts with and about individual informers. The collection also holds files on a significant cross-section of the social and political protest groups of the 1960s through the 1980s. Finally, the collection includes manuscripts of Donner's writings, including many unpublished articles and two unpublished books. The papers hold relatively little biographical or personal information about Frank Donner.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Frank J. Donner was a lawyer, journalist, historian and civil libertarian who remained active in the American left for the better part of five decades. From the first investigations of Communists by the House Committee on Un-American Activities to the Reagan-Bush years, Donner was a leading expert on the use of political surveillance in the United States. Donner's belief in the ideals of democracy and civil liberties led to a lifelong commitment to the social movements of the left. Over the years, Donner came to work with members of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), numerous unions, the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), the Socialist Workers Party, Students for a Democratic Society, Weathermen Underground, Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the Black Panther Party, and the Nuclear Freeze and Sanctuary movements. During these many years of activism, Donner collected his own set of files to rival those of J. Edgar Hoover, documenting and cataloguing the abuses of American political power. "The files and each item in them," wrote Donner "became for me a form of remonstrance, a private protest against betrayal by the government of its democratic premises."</p>
         <p>Donner's personal life history is difficult to trace. Born in 1911 in Brooklyn, New York, Donner was the child of poor, working-class parents. Donner received his college education at the University of Wisconsin, where he also received a master's degree in history in 1934. He graduated from Columbia Law School in 1937, and began working as a research fellow in legal history.</p>
         <p>Donner began his legal career as a staff attorney with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) where he worked from 1940 to 1943. Upon leaving government service, Donner worked as an assistant general counsel, first for the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and later for the United Steelworkers of America. In 1947, Donner went into private practice, specializing in constitutional law, labor law, and civil liberties.</p>
         <p>On several occasions Donner served as counsel for defendants brought before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, as well as various deportation and loyalty boards. So powerfully did Donner challenge these actions, that he was frequently named as a Communist by government informants and committee members. In 1956, Donner was himself forced to testify before HUAC about his activities while working for the NLRB. Throughout the questioning, Donner steadfastly refused to answer the question "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?" Instead, he challenged the committee's constitutional right to exist and the legal parameters of their questioning (a "typical Communist line" according to the Committee). Donner later dismissed the attacks as "a stupid smear."</p>
         <p>The political practices of the McCarthy era compelled Donner to become an author. In 1954, he began a long and fruitful relationship with <title render="italic">
               The Nation
            </title> when he published a long article entitled "The Informer." This article marked the beginning of Donner's research into the careers of individual informants, especially the 1950s generation of former Communists turned celebrity informants and professional anti-Communists (particularly Louis Budenz, Paul Crouch, Manning Johnson, Harvey "False Witness" Matusow, Matthew "I Was A Communist for the FBI" Cvetic, Herbert "I Led Three Lives" Philbrick, Elizabeth "Anti-Communist Queen" Bentley and others). Donner began working on a book-length study of the informant system, but legal problems and various threats of prosecution for libel prevented the book from ever being published.</p>
         <p>In 1961 Donner completed his first book, <title render="italic">
               The Un-Americans
            </title>, a study of the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the political resistance that the Committee provoked. By focusing upon the student opposition to HUAC, <title render="italic">
               The Un-Americans
            </title> marks a transition point in Donner's political evolution. With this book, Donner recognized the birth of a New Left that would be led by young people, students, minorities and women instead of traditional party structures such as the CPUSA. Donner enthusiastically dedicated himself to the New Left and reaffirmed his fierce opposition to the mechanisms of political surveillance and right-wing reaction that would soon be used to combat this youthful opposition.</p>
         <p>Through the 1960s, Donner served as general counsel for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), while working privately as a civil liberties lawyer. During this time, Donner published a number of his most important articles and reviews for <title render="italic">
               The Nation
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               Playboy
            </title>, and <title render="italic">
               Harper's
            </title>, gradually turning his political attention away from HUAC and towards "Spies on Campus," to cite the title of his 1968 article for <title render="italic">
               Playboy Magazine
            </title>.</p>
         <p>In 1971, Donner became the director of the American Civil Liberties Union Project on Political Surveillance, housed at the Yale Law School. There, Donner fully indulged his already well-established personal obsession with collecting information on "official attacks on non-conformity." He also began a program of interviewing political informants, especially the new generation of young infiltrators and provocateurs within the New Left. These investigations furthered Donner's desire to simultaneously catalogue the history of government abuses of civil liberties while placing such events within the broader context of American political theory and practice. The results proved to be very influential: in 1971 Donner published "Theory and Practice of American Political Intelligence" in the <title render="italic">
               New York Review of Books
            </title>, and by 1980 he completed his magnum opus, <title render="italic">
               The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods of America's Political Intelligence System
            </title>.</p>
         <p>
            <title render="italic">
               The Age of Surveillance
            </title> propelled Donner to the forefront of the national debate over congressional oversight for the FBI and, as Donner put it, "the use of intelligence as a mode of governance." Donner's attacks on the intelligence abuses of the past occurred just when he perceived a rebirth of government malfeasance under the Reagan administration. During the 1980s and early 1990s, having retired from legal practice, Donner was principally involved in two major writing projects: a companion book to <title render="italic">
               Age of Surveillance
            </title> on the history of police repression (published in 1990 as <title render="italic">
               Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads and Police Repression in Urban America
            </title>), and a book on the Reagan administration, which was entitled "Exploring the Wreckage" but never published.</p>
         <p>Until his death in 1993, Donner continued to publish articles in <title render="italic">
               The Nation
            </title>, while receiving numerous awards for his lifetime of service to the cause of civil liberties. Over four decades, Donner received the Tom Paine Award (1961), the Page One Award from the Newspaper Guild in 1972 for an article on Nixon's abuse of the grand jury system, the Sidney Hillman Award, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Playboy Foundation for the First Amendment, and the highest honor bestowed by the American Civil Liberties Union in 1985.</p>
         <p>Frank Donner died on June 10, 1993 at the age of 83. Donner was survived by his second wife Helen Brammal (his first wife Madeline died in 1985), his daughter Eleanor and son Peter, and five grandchildren.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series mainly falls under two headings: Individuals and Localities. One folder of Bibliographies relating to informers is placed at the beginning of the series and three folders relating to "Non-political" informers (e.g. within organized crime syndicates) are found at the end.</p>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the Individuals section consists of interview transcripts, clippings, correspondence, writings, notes, government documents, court transcripts, and other materials relating to specific government and police informers. The files were compiled by Donner during the course of his research on government surveillance and the use of informers. The informers predominantly date from two distinct periods: the red scare era of the late 1940s and 1950s and the counter-cultural movements of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Substantial amounts of material relate to Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, Joseph Burton, Paul Crouch, William G. Cummings, Matthew Cvetic, George Demmerle, Boyd Douglas, Larry Grathwohl, Nathaniel Honig, Manning Johnson, Joseph Kornfeder, John Lautner, Harvey Matusow, Joseph Mazzei, Thomas Mosher, Herbert Philbrick, Cecil Scott, and Thomas Tongyai (a.k.a. "Tommy the Traveler"). The section also includes material on a few individuals who provided information about informers to Donner, but did not serve as informers themselves. Three boxes of note cards relating to specific informers are listed at the end of the section. Information on these cards directly overlaps with individuals documented in the main run of files. Researchers should consult Series IV for Donner's writings about individual informers.</p>
               <p>The Localities section documents surveillance activities in specific cities and universities. The files are not comprehensive and information relating to these and many other localities can be found throughout the Individuals section and Series III. Four folders of miscellaneous clippings, correspondence, and notes regarding surveillance on college and university campuses are included at the end of the section.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Arranged alphabetically by individual and corporate names and topical headings, the series consists of a large variety of materials relating to a broad set of subjects that represent Donner's research interests and political and legal activities. Most of the files were collected, rather than created, by Donner. The files include correspondence, publications, legal documents, clippings, audio tapes, ephemera, and other materials relating to political organizations and movements, court cases, and government agencies and programs. Many of the files complement information found in other series, particularly the Individuals files of Series II. While cross-references have been made where feasible, they are not comprehensive.</p>
               <p>Extensive files document many social and political protest groups and movements from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, particularly those which faced legal charges based on the testimony of informers. The groups from the 1960s and 1970s include the American Indian Movement, the Camden Twenty-Eight, the Harrisburg Seven, the Seattle Liberation Front, and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Groups from the 1980s include the Jewish Defense League, as well as a host of organizations that sympathized with leftist revolutionary movements in Latin America, including Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES), the Movement Support Network, and a range of religious and political groups that are filed under the broad heading of the "Sanctuary movement." A particularly rich set of files document surveillance and informer activities in the Chicago area. They are dispersed throughout the following files: Alliance to End Repression, Chicago Peace Council, Chicago Police Department, Chicago Political Surveillance Litigation and Education Project, Socialist Workers Party, and a portion of the American Civil Liberties Union files. There is also documentation on other political and social protest organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Friends Service Committee, Campaign for Political Rights, the Christic Institute, and the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Donner also accumulated a set of files that document the protest movement against nuclear arms. Following Donner's own arrangement scheme, files of several anti-nuclear groups are listed collectively under the heading "Nuclear Freeze Movement."</p>
               <p>Most likely in support of his unpublished book on government malfeasance during the 1980s, "Exploring the Wreckage" (see Series IV), Donner also compiled multiple files relating to mainstream political issues and scandals of the 1980s. Notable topics include abortion (found under National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood), pornography (found under Attorney General's Commission on Pornography), legal aid (found under Legal Services Corporation), and the Iran/Contra scandal. Donner also put together files on several individuals nominated for federal judgeships and other government positions in the 1980s, including Robert Bork, Herbert Ellingswood, Anthony Kennedy, David Manion, Antonin Scalia, and David Treen.</p>
               <p>Files relating to individual court cases and deportation hearings comprise another significant portion of the series. The cases are filed under the names of the primary individuals involved. Donner served as counsel for some of these cases and as an advisor for others.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series includes published and unpublished articles, books, book reviews, letters, manuscripts, speeches, and notes written by Frank Donner and a small number of writings by other individuals. Organized alphabetically by type, the writings cover many themes including informers, police and government surveillance, the House Committee on Un-American Activities, civil liberties, civil rights, and the Reagan and Bush administrations of the 1980s.</p>
               <p>Donner's articles include both published works and manuscripts for both published and unpublished pieces. The published articles are divided between those which ran in <title render="italic">
                     The Nation
                  </title> and various other magazines. The "Donner/Francis Letters," a published exchange between Donner and Samuel Francis that ran over several issues of <title render="italic">
                     The Nation
                  </title>, are filed under the Letters section, which contains letters Donner wrote to various publications. The Manuscript articles are arranged alphabetically by title or subject and include writings on several informers, including Elizabeth Bentley, Winston Burdett, Larry Grantwohl, William Lemmer, Harvey Matusow, and Thomas Tongyai. Some of the manuscripts may overlap with chapters of Donner's unpublished book on informers, filed in the Books section.</p>
               <p>Arranged chronologically, the Books section consists of drafts, notes, reviews, and correspondence relating to Donner's three published and two unpublished monographs. Drafts of the two unpublished works, "Age of the Informer" and "Exploring the Wreckage" provide in depth analysis of the use of informers and of government malfeasance during the 1980s respectively. Many parts of "Age of the Informer" were published in other forms as articles or as part of <title render="italic">
                     The Age of Surveillance
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Donner's handwritten notes on a variety of topics are filed alphabetically by topic under the heading of Notes. One box of miscellaneous note cards is included at the end of the section. The series also includes a small number of Donner's Speeches on topics such as the American right wing, political intelligence work, and civil liberties.</p>
               <p>The final section of the series is Writings of Others, which consists of manuscripts of articles sent to Donner, presumably for his review. The writings are arranged alphabetically by author and the topics mirror the subject strengths of the rest of the collection, focusing on informers, provocateurs, police and government surveillance, the radical right, and civil liberties.</p>
