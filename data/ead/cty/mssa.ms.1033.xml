         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These letters, photographs, and other papers pertain to a visit by William E. Parsons and Myra L. (Crosby) Parsons to Manila during July through October of 1939. The sixteen letters written by Myra Parsons to members of the family, describe the cruise from San Francisco to Manila via Japan and China, and a collision of the ship with a Japanese freighter in Shanghai harbor which she ascribes to possible Japanese ill will. The subject of the inevitability of a Japanese take-over of the Philippines and the possibility of war in Asia is also mentioned, as is the war in Europe. The letters also describe Manila's high society life, native customs, and the life of the American community, with some comments on William Parson's work as consulting architect to the Philippine government.</p>
         <p>Also in the collection are an itinerary of the trip, several photographs of Philippine scenery, a notebook recording expenses and shopping expeditions, an assortment of bills and receipts, and a miscellany of calling cards, newspaper clippings, memorabilia, and three copies of the Manila Polo Club weekly newsletter. Postcards which were part of this collection have been transferred to the Historical Postcard Collection, Manuscript Group Number 1101.</p>
         <p>The provenance of this collection is unknown.</p>
