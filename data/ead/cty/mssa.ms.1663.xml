         <abstract id="aspace_101b9768d800bcb966f032453731c466">The papers consist of two manuscript journals recounting the campaign against Maxamad Cabdulle Xasan, the "Mad Mullah of Somaliland," from March 19 to August 5, 1903. Cobbold describes the sufferings on the march, the heat, the lack of palatable food, native customs, intelligence reports from escaped prisoners of the Mullah, details of the Italian campaign against the Mullah, reports of casualties, and skirmishes and rumors of a disastrous defeat of the British force. Preceding the journal is Cobbold's retained copy of a letter written by him at the end of January 1903 describing the plans for disembarking troops and proceeding against the Mullah.</abstract>

         <p>The Ralph P. Cobbold Papers consist of Cobbold's diaries which provide a detailed description of the joint military campaign launched by the British, Italians, and Abyssinians (now Ethiopians) against the religious reformer, Maxamad Cabdulle Xasan (the Mad Mullah), in Ogaden Country, 1901.</p>
         <p>Cobbold's journals describe the hardships encountered on the expedition such as the heat and unpalatable food, details of the Italian campaign against the Mullah, rumors of a defeat of the British force, and intelligence reports from the Mullah's escaped prisoners. A letter written by Cobbold in January, 1903 at Berbera, the chief port of British Somaliland, describes plans for disembarking troops and supplies and proceeding against the Mullah.</p>
         <p>A volume of military reports and despatches written by A. Hanbury-Tracy (Royal Horse Guards) and by R. P. Cobbold (Late 60th Rifles) includes original prints of the Abyssinian fighters in the field.</p>
         <p>The collection was acquired by the African Collection Curator in 1994.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Major Ralph Patteson Cobbold was a member of a well-known Suffolk, England family of bankers, and travelled extensively in Central Asia. With Major Algernon Hanbury-Tracy, Cobbold went on a special mission to the Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), the result of their visit being the consolidation of British interests and influence in that part of the world. In 1901, Cobbold marched with the Abyssinian army during the Somaliland campaign, and in 1903 he was again attached to the army, which formed part of the combined Abyssinian, British, and Italian expedition against Maxamad Cabdulle Xasan.</p>
