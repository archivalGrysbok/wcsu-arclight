         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The James Harvey Linsley Family Papers consist of correspondence, writings, notebooks, and other papers of several member of the Linsley family. The bulk of the material reflects James Harvey Linsley's interests. Two notebooks contain his notes and catalogs of shells and botanical terms, while a scrapbook contains clippings of his writings on political and agricultural topics as printed in the <title render="italic">
               Gospel Witness
            </title> and the <title render="italic">
               Republican Farmer
            </title>. The papers also contain a notebook kept by Linsley at Yale College.</p>
         <p>Papers of Jesse Linsley and Reuben Linsley relate to North Branford, Connecticut, where James Harvey Linsley was born. These papers include an account book of Jesse Linsley and an inventory of the estate of Reuben Linsley showing the division of property between his daughter Polly and his widow Tryphena Linsley.</p>
         <p>Papers of James Halsey Linsley relate to his education at the normal school in New Britain, Connecticut and his teaching career. His compositions include instructions on how to teach. James Halsey Linsley's relation to the other Linsley family members represented in the papers is unclear.</p>
         <p>The Linsley Papers were transferred from the Miscellaneous Manuscripts Collection (MS 352) in 1985. Some of the papers were donated to the Yale Library by William Lyon Phelps, a grandson of James Harvey Linsley, while others were apparently purchased from a dealer.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>James Harvey Linsley, the eldest of ten children of James and Sarah (Maltby) Linsely, of Northford, in (North) Branford, Connecticut, was born on May 5, 1787. His parents were Baptists, and after he had taught for several years he became a member of the church and decided to study for the ministry. He was obliged to teach during much of his College course, to obtain money, and this excessive labor injured permanently his constitution.</p>
         <p>After graduation he continued to teach in New Haven, where he was married, on February 1, 1818, to Sophia Brainard, daughter of Colonel William and Lois (Masfield) Lyon.</p>
         <p>In May 1818, he took charge of the New Canaan Academy, which he left in April, 1821, to establish a boarding school for boys in Stratford, which was thenceforth his home.</p>
         <p>In addition to his teaching, he began in 1828 to preach as he had opportunity, though not regularly licensed until January 1831; and on desiring to undertake stated ministerial work, he was ordained as an Evangelist on June 9, in Meriden, at a meeting of the Baptist State Convention.</p>
         <p>At the same time he gave up his school to devote himself wholly to his new duties.</p>
         <p>For nearly five years he was exclusively occupied with preaching, having also the pastoral care of two Baptist socities which he had gathered, in Milford (1832) and Bridgeport (1835).</p>
         <p>Early in 1836 the constant exertion of his voice brought on an alarming attack of bronchitis, which forbade further public speaking.</p>
         <p>He then had leisure to indulge his enthusiasm for natural history, and in his remaining years he gave himself with all his wonted energy and perseverance to the preparation of exhaustive catalogues of the birds, mammals, reptiles, fishes, and shells collected by himself in Connecticut.</p>
         <p>Meantime his health was precarious, and after a brief final lillness he died at his home in Stratford, on December 26, 1843, in his 57th year.</p>
         <p>His widow died in Stratford on January 31, 1866, in her 84th year. Their children were two daughters, the younger of whom married the Rev. Dr. Sylvanus Dryden Phelps (Brown Univ. 1844).</p>
