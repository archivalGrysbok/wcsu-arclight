         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The James Jackson Jarves Collection consist primarily of correspondence, which has been divided into three subsections: "Family Correspondence", "General Correspondence," and "Correspondence of Others". In "Family Correspondence" either the author and/or recipient of each letter is a family member. The entire subsection consists of 26 folders and is arranged alphabetically by author. The letters written by the ten authors in this section include those of James Jackson Jarves to his children; Elizabeth Russell Swain Jarves (first wife of Jarves) to her own parents (Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Swain); and Isabel Hayden Jarves (second wife of Jarves) to her stepchildren. Many of these letters give an insight into the often unhappy relationship between Jarves and other family members.</p>
         <p>The 19 folders of "General Correspondence" are arranged alphabetically by author and contain letters dealing with Jarves' business and governmental activities in Hawaii. His inclination to provoke controversy is indicated by a series of heated exchanges between himself and J. Dudoit, French ambassador to Hawaii.</p>
         <p>The last eight folders of correspondence consists of the "Correspondence of Others". These contain miscellaneous letters, some of which pertain to the Jarves art collection owned by Yale University.</p>
         <p>The correspondence is followed by a few miscellaneous items, one including a diary by Elizabeth R. S. Jarves which renders her impressions about her first trip to Hawaii. Another diary, by Horatio Deming Jarves (James and Elizabeth Jarves' first child), records his account of his first few months of battle (1861) in the Civil War.</p>
         <p>Boxes 2-5 contain the working files for Francis Steegmuller's <title render="italic">
               The Two Lives of James Jackson Jarves
            </title> (Yale University Press, 1951). These files include a large number of photostatic and transcript copies of letters of James Jackson Jarves and members of his family, plus photostatic copies of his writings and other related materials. The photostatic letters are copies of originals in the National Archives; the transcripts are copies of letters in Box 1, Series I. Also included are letters of Francis Steegmuller regarding research and publication of the book.</p>
         <p>The Steegmuller addition was donated to Yale University by Mr. Steegmuller in 1955. It was added to the James Jackson Jarves Papers in 1980.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>James Jackson Jarves was born Aug. 20, 1818, the son of Deming Jarves, founder of the famous Sandwich Glass Co., and Anna Smith (Stutson) Jarves. After his early education at Chauncey Hall school, Boston, Mass., he planned to continue studies at Harvard University. Because of failing eye sight however, he was unable to attend. In search of a better climate for his health, Jarves sailed for Hawaii in 1837. He stayed in Hawaii until 1848 except for two brief interludes, one in 1838 when he returned to Boston to marry his first wife, Elizabeth Russell Swain; and the second in 1842 when the Jarves family returned to Boston after a silk worm industry in Hawaii, in which Jarves held a partnership, went bankrupt.</p>
         <p>Although Jarves' business adventures in Hawaii were more often than not unsuccessful, he met with limited success as a writer and editor. In 1843 he wrote the <title render="italic">
               History of the Hawaiian Islands
            </title>, and in 1840 he established <title render="italic">
               The Polynesian
            </title>, one of the first Hawaiian newspapers to be written in English. In 1844 <title render="italic">
               The Polynesian
            </title> became the official governmental newspaper and Jarves, with a five year contract, received the title of Director of the Government Press.</p>
         <p>An unhappy marriage caused Jarves to break with his wife in 1848, leave his governmental position, and return to America for three years where he again participated in a disastrous business adventure, this time involving land speculation in California.</p>
         <p>In 1851 the Jarves' family (then reunited) settled in Florence, Italy, and there Jarves developed an interest in art - specifically in medieval Italian paintings. Using his father's income, he amassed a collection of paintings that, covering a period of 600 years, exhibited the progress of Italian painting from its early beginnings. As with his previous business endeavors, his art collection was never financially profitable for him. Jarves decided to sell his collection "en bloc" in America, but he could not find a buyer. After several unsuccessful attempts to sell his collection in Boston and New York City (1859-1866), he was finally able to display his collection at Yale College in 1867 for a loan of $20,000.00. Unable to repay the loan and $2,000.00 interest three years later, he was forced to auction his collection. It was sold to Yale for $22,000.00.</p>
         <p>From the time that he settled in Florence until his death in 1888, Jarves' primary interest was art. Not only was he responsible for amassing a valuable European art collection and transporting it to the United States, but he was also a contributor to the art scholarship of the time. He wrote several books, including: <title render="italic">
               Art Hints
            </title> (1855); <title render="italic">
               Art Studies: The Old Masters of Italy
            </title> (1861); <title render="italic">
               The Art Idea: Sculpture, Painting, and Architecture in America
            </title> (1866); <title render="italic">
               Art Thoughts: The Experiences and Observations of an American Amateur in Europe
            </title> (1876).</p>
