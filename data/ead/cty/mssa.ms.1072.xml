         <p>John Davenport was baptized at the Church of the Holy Trinity, in Coventry, England, on April 9, 1597, presumably shortly after his birth. He was the fifth son of Henry Davenport, who was mayor of Coventry in 1613. He attended Oxford for a short time, but was forced to drop out for financial reasons, only to return in 1615 when he received a Bachelor of Divinity degree Magdalen College. By 1615, Davenport was already preaching and in 1624, he was elected vicar at St. Stephen's in London, despite ecclesiastical objections that he had Puritan leanings. Though he confessed complete conformity at the time, Davenport became increasingly more Puritan and on August 5, 1633, fled England for Haarlem, in the Netherlands. He fell into conflict there too, and returned to England in 1637 with the intention of sailing for America. Davenport arrived in Boston on June 26, 1637, and in April, 1638 settled in New Haven, where Davenport became pastor of First Church. As pastor of the town, Davenport was one of the most influential figures in the early history of New Haven. However, he was unable, despite earnest resistance, to prevent New Haven from being annexed by the larger colony of Connecticut in 1662. Davenport died in Boston, in March of 1670.</p>
