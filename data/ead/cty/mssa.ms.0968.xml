         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The papers of John Metcalf Garfield consist primarily of diaries, notebooks, and account books. There is, first, a series of five notebooks recording expenses and lectures at Yale College, 1812-1816. In two of these are included diary entries for the years 1815-1816 and 1823-1825, while a separate volume continues the diary combined with Garfield's ecclesiatical itinerary for 1826-1828 and a record of baptisms, marriages, and funerals for 1826 to 1872. Notes on sermons and Greek literature conclude this series of notebooks.</p>
         <p>The next group of volumes contains records of Garfield's teaching from 1816 through 1830, both of private students and in the New Haven Female Seminary, which he founded in 1819. Included are accounts, grades, and other records. There are also a few items from the Albany Female Seminary.</p>
         <p>The final two items in the collection are a lease from Garfield to Robert Morrison for property in New Haven, and a household account books kept by Garfield's wife, Ann (Lyon) Garfield (d. 1872).</p>
         <p>The papers are described in greater detail on the following pages. They were purchased in 1940.</p>

         <p>JOHN METCALF GARFIELD, eldest son of Timothy and Eunice (Pond) Garfield, was born 21 July, 1790, in Grafton, Mass.</p>
         <p>After graduation from Yale in 1816 he began the study of law with Seth P. Staples of New Haven. At the close of his second year, he became a teacher in the Lansingburgh (N. Y.) Academy, and after a year spent there, took charge of the Grammar School in Troy, N. Y.</p>
         <p>In 1819 he established a Female Seminary in New Haven, which he conducted successfully until 1831, where he was appointed Principal of the Albany Female Seminary. During this time he pursued theological studies, and was ordained deacon in the Prot. Episc. Church by Bishop Brownell, in Hamden, Conn., 11 Aug., 1822, and was admitted to the priesthood, by the same prelate, in Meriden, 4 June, 1823. From this time he regularly officiated in neighboring towns until his removal from the State.</p>
         <p>Mr. Garfield continued in his position in Albany until 1849, when he returned to New Haven. Here he resided until his death, and for the greater part of the time had charge of a church of colored people in the city.</p>
         <p>He married, 22 Nov., 1816, Ann, eldest daughter of Nathaniel Lyon, of New Haven, and had two sons and six daughters. He died 10 March, 1872, and his wife two days later.</p>
