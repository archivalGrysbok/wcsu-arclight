         <p>Paul Marvin Rudolph, architect and educator, was born October 23, 1918, in Elton, Kentucky. He graduated from Alabama Polytechnic Institute (B.A., 1940) and Harvard University (M.A., 1947), where we studied under Walter Gropius.</p>
         <p>After serving in the Naval Reserve during World War II, he worked as an architect in Sarasota, Florida and Cambridge, Massachusetts. His designs included residential, commercial, and institutional structures. Major projects included several model homes: the Blue Cross-Blue Shield headquarters building, in Boston; the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan; the Jewett Arts Center at Wellesley College, Massachusetts; the Art and Architecture Building, and other projects, at Yale University; the chapel and other buildings at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama; the Boston Government Center; and the Colgate Creative Arts Center, New York. Rudolph's awards included the Outstanding Young Architects Award, Sa√µ Paulo (Brazil) International Competition, (1954); and the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Arnold Brunner Prize in Architecture, (1958).</p>
         <p>Rudolph taught at numerous architectural schools as a visiting critic or lecturer. At Yale he served as chairman of the Department of Architecture and as James M. Hoppin Professor from 1958-1965.</p>
