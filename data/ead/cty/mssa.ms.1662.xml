         <p>George S. Lewis was a British private with the Bearer Company, Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospital, South African Field Office. He was captured by Boers near Roodwal en route from Bloemfontein to Johannesburg in May, 1900 and was held prisoner for four days before being rescued by Lord Methuen. Lewis was subsequently confined to the Johannesburg Hospital for six weeks. Upon his recovery, he worked at the No. 3 Model School Hospital from mid-August to November, tending British and Boer wounded. Lewis then traveled to the Maitland Camp at Cape Town to await shipment home on board the S. S. "Orotava."</p>
