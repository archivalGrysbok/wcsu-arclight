The papers document Silver's concern for the quality and costs of medical care in the United States and in developing countries and his focus on comprehensive health care planning.

         <p>Collection is arranged in three series: I. General Files, 1955-1999; II. Writing and Teaching, 1951-1999; III. Personal Papers, 1946-1998.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Though the George Silver Papers span the years 1946 to 1999, the materials best document Silver's professional career from the time of his arrival at Yale in 1969. Through correspondence and writings, which Silver addressed to both the professional and the layman, the papers reflect Silver's opinions on and attempts to shape American health policy. They highlight his interests in issues such as health manpower, medical education, the problems of foreign medical graduates, and promotion of a socially responsible attitude among physicians and public health officials. The papers do not include administrative files from Silver's day to day activities at Montefiore Hospital, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, or the National Urban Coalition. There is also only a limited amount of material documenting Silver's teaching at Yale.</p>
         <p>Bruce Stark completed the original arrangement and first finding aid to the Silver Papers in 1982. After Silver gave more materials for the collection, Bella Berson rearranged the materials slightly in order to integrate these additions. This finding aid reflects the changes she has made.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>George Albert Silver's career focused on comprehensive health planning. His concern for the level and costs of medical care in the United States, particularly for children and the elderly, made him a leader in the fight for equitable health care and national health insurance. His interests expanded to expertise in international health, especially health policy in developing countries.</p>
         <p>Silver was born in 1913 in Philadelphia, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1934, and received his M.D. from Jefferson Medical College in 1938. During World War II, Silver served as an officer with the 10thField Hospital in the European theater. After spending thirty months overseas in war-ravaged countries, he found his interests had shifted. Rather than return to private medical practice, he chose to dedicate his career to social medicine and public health. He served for a year as regional medical officer in the migrant labor program of the United States Department of Agriculture. Silver was then awarded a National Foundation Fellowship at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene, and received his M.P.H. in 1947.</p>
         <p>From 1947 to 1951, he was a health officer in Baltimore and assistant professor in local health administration in the School of Hygiene at Johns Hopkins. For the next fifteen years, he was chief of the Division of Social Medicine at Montefiore Hospital in New York City and in charge of the Montefiore Medical Group, the Home Care program, and the Family Health Maintenance Demonstration. He also served on the faculties of Columbia University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the University of Michigan, teaching courses in public health administration and preventive medicine.</p>
         <p>In March 1966, John Gardner, secretary of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, appointed Silver deputy secretary for health and scientific affairs, a position he retained until November 1968, when he joined Gardner at the National Urban Coalition, as an executive associate responsible for program planning in health matters. Silver began lecturing in public health at Yale University in 1965 and fours years later, he was made a professor of public health in the Yale School of Medicine.</p>
         <p>While at Yale Silver wrote three of his four books: <title render="italic">
               Family Medical Care: A Report on the Family Health Maintenance Demonstration
            </title> (1963), <title render="italic">
               Family Medical Care: A Design for Health Maintenance
            </title> (1974), <title render="italic">
               A Spy in the House of Medicine
            </title> (1976), and <title render="italic">
               Child Health, America's Future
            </title> (1978). He also published numerous articles and lectured widely in the United States and abroad on social medicine, group practice, medical care organization, health policy, and health problems in the third world. He also served as a consultant in comprehensive health planning.</p>
         <p>Silver served on the Advisory Health Council of the American Arbitration Association, chair of the Committee on International Health of the American Public Health Association, and a member of the board of directors of the Health Manpower Development Corporation and the Jewish Home for the Aged in New Haven. For the Milbank Memorial Fund, he was a member of the Technical Board and of the Commission for the Study of Higher Education in Public Health.</p>
         <p>Silver's many honors include the Martha Eliot Award of the American Public Health Association in 1980, appointment as Senior Member of the National Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in 1983, and a Rockefeller Bellagio Study Award in 1983. He was named professor emeritus in 1984.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series I includes proposals relating to George Silver's research and consultations, correspondence, and reports. Silver's correspondence is with professional colleagues in the health care field, political figures concerned with health policy, institutions, organizations, government agencies, journals, and publishers. It constitutes the bulk of the material in the series. The files are arranged in a single alphabetical order by person or organization.</p>
               <p>The series documents Silver's broad professional activities, including his chairmanship of an American Public Health Association committee on international health, his efforts on a subcommittee of the Committee for Economic Development to plan a national health care system, and his recommendations to the Milbank Memorial Fund concerning higher education for public health practitioners. These files also contain material relating to his leadership in planning and implementing a new Jewish Home for the Aged in New Haven and his association with the National Urban Coalition for improving medical care for the poor in inner cities.</p>
               <p>Files concerning Silver's tenure in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare contain proposals for new programs, while the John Gardner files reflect a personal friendship and deal less with the on-going work at HEW or National Urban Coalition. While the series includes some files concerning the Yale School of Medicine, these relate to fairly routine administrative matters and are not particularly reflective of the debate concerning the public health curriculum in the school during this period.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains copies of George Silver's journal articles, interviews, round table discussions, reports, letters to the editor, book reviews, lectures, and congressional testimony. Relevant correspondence with publishers and readers, publicity, and reviews are filed with the associated writing. The series also includes correspondence, contracts, reviews, and publicity relating to Silver's books, including one never published. The writings are arranged in one chronological order by date of publication, except for materials relating to books, which are arranged separately. Files relating to Silver's books do not include drafts.</p>
               <p>Since the papers do not include a complete bibliography of Silver's publications, the writing files are useful as a record of Silver's public statements. Autobiographical sketches can be found in "Some Scenes from a Life in Public Health," prepared for response to remarks made at "Silver Day" at the Yale School of Medicine, June 1, 1984, and "Sketches from the Biography of an Unreasonable Man," presented at the American Public Health Association's Honor Ceremony, Medical Care Section, in 1980.</p>
               <p>The series also includes a limited amount of documentation of Silver's teaching experience at the Montefiore Hospital and Yale University.</p>
