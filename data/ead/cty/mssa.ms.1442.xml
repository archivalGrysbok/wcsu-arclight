         <p>Jonathan Humphrey Bissell, son of Titus Lucretius Bissell, Sr., and Eunice (Humphrey) Bissell, was born on June 9, 1800, in Windsor, Connecticut. The family moved to Hartford, Connecticut, during Bissell's youth. He entered Yale College in 1815, received his B.A. in 1819, and returned to Hartford to study law. After beginning his law practice in New Orleans, Louisiana, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina in 1824. Around 1830 he gave up his legal career to become manager and agent for a North Carolina gold-mining company. Bissell never married; he died of pneumonia on March 18, 1845, in Philadelphia, while traveling to New York City on business.</p>
