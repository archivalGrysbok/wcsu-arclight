         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>John Cockrill Shackelford was born August 4, 1829, in Saline County, Mo., the son of Thomas Shackelford, a farmer, and Eliza Cheves (Pulliam) Shackelford. His father moved with his family to Missouri from Tennessee in 1817, and entered several thousand acres of farm land. He was made one of the first county judges of Saline County and his influence was strong in the early history of the state. He died when his son John was only six years old, leaving the care of their large family and of the farm to his wife.</p>
         <p>After attending the best schools in his own state and studying law in the office of an older brother, Mr. Shackelford entered the Law School at Ballston Spa, N.Y. When he had been there nearly two years, a remarkable experience led him to give up law for the ministry. In 1850 he entered Yale, graduating with honors four years later.</p>
         <p>He then returned to Missouri, and in September, 1854, became an active minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In the St. Louis Conference, and later in the Southwest Missouri Conference, he gave himself without stint to the hard work of the pioneer preacher. His health gave way after ten years of this service under the added strain of war conditions and deep personal sorrow because of the deaths of his two sons. He was forced to seek a renewal of strength by a return to country life. From "Rural Retreat," his farm home in Lafayette County, he continued with unremitting zeal the work to which he had dedicated his life, preaching in near-by churches, writing continuously for the church and local papers, and leading in every movement for the advancement of the community. In 1897 Mr. Shackelford and his family moved to Sweet Springs, Saline County, Mo. There he continued his work preaching until within the last few years of his life whenever he was called upon by any denomination in the town or surrounding country. After his wife's death in 1907, he spent part of his time in the home of his son-in-law, Rev. James Clyde Saylor, a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, always lending help and support to Mr. Saylor and his wife in their work. His death occurred at their home in Marshfield, Mo., on July 11, 1918. His body was taken back to Sweet Springs and interred in the family lot in Fairview Cemetery.</p>
         <p>Mr. Shackleford was married November 6, 1859, in Lafayette County, Mo., to Martha, daughter of Lewis and Elizabeth (Kinchelo) Neale, then residents of Lafayette County, but formerly of Virginia. His wife's death occurred December 2, 1907. Of the four children born to Mr. and Mrs. Shackleford, the two sons, Samuel and John Wesley, died in early childhood. The daughters, Emma Neale and Mary Birdie, wife of Rev. James Clyde Saylor, survive.</p>
