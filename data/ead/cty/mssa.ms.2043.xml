         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection consists of over two hundred hand-written, printed, or mimeographed documents from the Jewish community of Vilna (Vilnius), as well as about twenty documents from Kovno (Kaunas) and a few sent to Vilna from other places. The Vilna collection includes letters, announcements, poems, essays, invitations to cultural events, circulars, newsletters, by-laws, and reports of various communal organizations. Among the papers are rare publications, such as a mimeographed text-booklet dated 1940 for students in the vocational program in metals technology at the ORT school of Vilna, or issues of the newsletter of the Yiddishist youth group Bin (Bee). The documents from Kovno include memoranda of the community council, a survey of schools in the area, notices, and forms. According to the vendor, the papers were originally in the collection of the bibliographer, Leyzer Ran. Facsimiles of some of these documents appeared in Ran's 1974 book, Jerusalem of Lithuania: illustrated and documented, but most are unpublished. Many of the documents are marked with Leyzer Ran's distinctive stamp.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Leyzer Ran (1912-1995), was born and grew up in the vibrant Jewish community of Vilna, an intellectual, religious, and cultural center considered "the Jerusalem of Lithuania." After the Holocaust he settled in New York and set about collecting documentary evidence of the lost Yiddish civilization, establishing a reputation as Vilna's foremost bibliographer and ephemerist.</p>

         <head>Arrangement</head>
         <p>The papers contain three sets of documents purchased from the same vendor over a four-year period. For the most part papers are arranged in the order received from the vendor.  This list covers the papers acquired in 2010, the largest portion of the collection. These papers have been placed in folders numbered 1-189, according to the vendor's item numbers. Additional documents acquired in 2014 were placed in subsequent folders, the items from Vilna numbered 190-203 and from Kovno 204-205. The last folder (206) contains a group of documents from Kovno bound loosely together with thread that was acquired in 2012.</p>
