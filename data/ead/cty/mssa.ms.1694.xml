         <p>Arthur Ebbert was born in 1922 in Wheeling, West Virginia. He received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Virginia.  After completion of a one year internship at the University of Virginia Hospital, he went on duty in July 1947 as an Army medical officer, serving almost two years in Japan. Discharged from the Army in April 1949, Ebbert returned to the University of Virginia for post-graduate training in internal medicine. On completion of the three-year program, he joined the University of Virginia faculty as an instructor until coming to Yale in 1953 as the assistant dean of postgraduate education and was promoted to associate dean in 1960. He became the School of Medicine's first deputy dean in 1974 and served in that role until 1987. He also founded and edited the Alumni Bulletin and later Yale Medicine between 1953 and 1986. Ebbert died in Hamden, Connecticut, on June 7, 2012.</p>
