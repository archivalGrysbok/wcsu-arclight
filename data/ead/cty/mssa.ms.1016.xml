         <p>The papers of Alfred Elijah Perkins pertain for the most part to his study at Yale College. They include thirty-two disputes and compositions written between 1828 and 1830 on topics of historical, political, religious, and general interest, a notebook containing an essay on Ecclesiastes IX, 18, and a printed volume, <title render="italic">

         <p>There are, in addition, three letters written from Madeira and Barbados by Perkins to his family in 1833. These describe his voyages to Europe and back, and his impressions of the places he had visited.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Alfred Elijah Perkins, son of Major Joseph and Mary (Watkinson) Perkins, of Norwich, Connecticut, was born on April 5, 1809. A sister married the Hon. John A. Rockwell (Yale 1822).</p>
         <p>He attended three courses of medical lectures, the first in Boston, and the others at the University of Pennsylvania. At the close of the last course, as a result of his strenuous application in preparation for his examinations, he was quite suddenly and severely attacked with pulmonary consumption. He was able to secure in March, 1833, the degree of M.D., and spent the next six months in the South. In September he started for Madeira, going thence to the West Indies, and returning home in the summer of 1834 by way of New Orleans and the Mississippi. He died in Norwich on October 29, in his 26thyear. He was never married.</p>
         <p>By his will he left $10,000 to the Yale Library for the purchase of books; so large a sum had not before been given at one time by any individual to the College.</p>
