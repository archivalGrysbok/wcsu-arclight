         <p>John Quincy Bradish was born in Floyd, N.Y., March 29, 1832, the son of Clark and Hannah (Hayes) Bradish. He was the grandson of Dr. James Bradish, who served as a surgeon in the Continental Army, and a descendant of Robert Bradish, who came from England to Cambridge, Mass., in 1635.</p>
         <p>He was given second dispute appointments in both Junior and Senior years at Yale. He belonged to Brothers in Unity.</p>
         <p>From 1857 until 1861 Mr. Bradish was principal of the Meriden (Conn.) Institute, after which he held a similar position at the Riverside Institute at Warehouse Point, Conn., for two years. In April, 1863, he became a member of the faculty at the Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y., continuing there until 1866, when he was obliged to resign on account of trouble with his eyes. From that time until 1896 he was engaged in business in New York City as a dealer in stationery and fancy goods. Returning to New Haven, he took up the study of law in the office of Lynde Harrison (LL.B. 1860), and in January, 1900, was admitted to the bar. He afterwards practiced in New Haven for a while, giving especial attention to the writing of wills and the securing of patents. He was later engaged in the real estate business in Providence and at Fort Stockton, Texas. Since 1916 he had conducted a stationery business in Anthony, R.I. He was a member of the First Church of Christ Scientist in Providence. In 1920 Mr. Bradish established a fund of over $3,800 at Yale which will eventually be available for scholarship loans.</p>
         <p>He was married December 3, 1858, to S. Jennie Mather, whose death occurred November 1, 1859. On August 28, 1862, he was married a second time to Susannah Rikeman, daughter of Joseph Pearce and Cornelia (Peterson) Simpson. She died August 3, 1904. By his second marriage Mr. Bradish had a son, Stanley Pearce, who graduated from the Yale School of Law in 1899, and a daughter, Cornelia Belle, who died in infancy. Surviving him are his son; a grandson, Donald Millard Bradish, of Anthony, R.I.; and a sister, Mrs. Emily White, of Oak Park, Ill.</p>
