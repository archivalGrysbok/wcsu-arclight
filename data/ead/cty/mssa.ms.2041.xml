         <p>Julia Penelope was an author, philosopher and linguist who focused on lesbian and feminist issues. She was born Julia Penelope Stanley on June 19, 1941 in Miami, Florida. She initially attended Florida State University, but was expelled for being a lesbian during the investigations performed by the Charlie Johns Investigating Committee on Communism and Homosexuality. She moved to the University of Miami, but was expelled from there in 1960 for similar reasons. She finally completed her BA in English and linguistics at City College, City University of New York and earned her Ph. D in English from University of Texas at Austin in 1971. After that she taught at several universities, including the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>
         <p>Penelope's work often focused on the erasure and visibility of women, especially lesbian women. She was also an activist who focused on community building. She was active in Modern Languages Association (MLA) and the National Women's Studies Association (NWSA), often organizing events and panels related to feminist and lesbian literature and language. She also was one of the women who conceived of the Lesbian Herstory Archive, located in Brooklyn, New York. She was controversial, both inside and outside the lesbian community due to her separatist beliefs as well as for criticizing certain aspects of the lesbian community, such as those who participated in BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism) practices. Due to the divergence of beliefs and the resulting infighting between lesbians in the lesbian-feminist community, Penelope stopped writing and teaching after 1998 and became a freelance copy editor. She died on January 19, 2013 at the age of 71.</p>
         <p>Penelope published several articles and books. Her earlier works was published under Julia P. Stanley while her later works were published under Julia Penelope. The data collected in the studies that comprise this collection was used in writing the article "Homosexual Slang" for the journal <title render="italic">

            </title> and <title render="italic">

         <p>The papers concern Julia Penelope's study of language used in gay and lesbian communities throughout the United States, specifically slang. The slang studied included terms for referring to members of these communities, outsiders of these communities, behavior, and actions, including sex-related acts. The results were used in her 1970 article "Homosexual Slang," published in the journal <title render="italic">
               American Speech

               Sexist Slang and the Gay Community
            </title> (Michigan Occasional Papers in Women's Studies, No. 14). The papers are dated from 1964 to 2001 and consist of anonymous questionnaires completed in 1967 and 1973, research notes, drafts, and unpublished and published reports of the studies. Also included is one file of correspondence between Penelope and donor Bert Hansen, as well as Hansen's notes regarding the materials. While a good portion of the questionnaires from both attempts of the study are present, neither run is complete. The 1967 studies are labeled solely by subject number, while the 1973 studies are also labeled with the gender and the birth year of the respondent. (Sometimes the year is approximate based on what the respondent provided.)</p>
