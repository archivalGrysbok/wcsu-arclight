               <p>Sponsored by the Yale University Library, two renowned authors   Booker Prize winner Penelope Lively and Pulitzer Prize winner David McCullough   offer their perspectives on their craft. The event was moderated by University Librarian Alice Prochaska</p>
               <p>Lively began her career as an author of children's books. Her works include "The Ghost of Thomas Kempe," for which she received the Carnegie Medal, and "A Stitch in Time," which won the Whitbread Award. She has been nominated three times for the Booker Prize, an annual contemporary fiction award presented to writers in the British Commonwealth or Ireland, and she won it in 1987 for her novel "Moon Tiger." She is a fellow of the Royal Society for Literature and a member of PEN and the Society of Authors. She was designated as an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1989 by Queen Elizabeth II and was promoted to commander in 2001. Her most recent novel, "Consequences," was published in June 2007</p>
               <p>McCullough has been called the "master of the art of narrative history." A 1955 graduate of Yale College, he has twice won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. In December of 2006, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. His 2001 biography of patriot and founding father John Adams has been turned into a seven-part mini-series by HBO.The DVD includes an interview with McCullough that was filmed at Sterling Memorial Library this past summer</p>

               <p>The Yale University Library and Oxford University Press sponsored a panel lecture on October 1, 2008 to celebrate the 80th birthday of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the comprehensive dictionary of the English language. The speakers were Fred Shapiro, Simon Winchester, Jesse Sheidlower, and Ammon Shea. Each brought unqiue and engaging insights to this discussion of the history, function and future of the dictionary</p>
               <p>The OED was formally lauched June 6, 1928, and it took 70 years to compile the initial 10 volumes, which contained almost 415,000 words. Former British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin called the creation of the OED "the greatest enterprise of its kind in history." Today, the OED fills 20 volumes and weighs 137 pounds. It has been available on the Internet since 2000 as the <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest"
