         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These papers of Dr. Frank Pell Underhill, 1877-1932, consist of correspondence, reports, memoranda, and other materials dealing with data on gas poisoning collected during World War I by the medical division of the Chemical Warfare Service, of which Underhill was a member, and appendices to chapters 2-3, 5-7, and 15 of his book, <emph render="italic">The Lethal War Gases</emph> (1919); and of reports, testimony, and so forth, for the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into the use of alum in foods, records of diet experiments with dogs, and other matters. There is a correspondence file of letters and other papers relating to the New Haven chapter of American Officers of the Great War, to courses in physiological chemistry given in Sheffield Scientific School and Yale Medical School, to publication of Underhill's books with Yale Press, to reports to coroners on chemical tests, and other matters.</p>
         <p>The papers, which are unprocessed, have been very roughly sorted by subject, and all original folder headings have been retained. Many groups of papers arrived unfoldered, and often papers on various topics are intermixed. A series of memoranda and reports of poison gas experiments wer contained in numbered folders, many of them empty, and these have been arranged in numerical order after the empty folders had been discarded. The correspondence file has been put into Box 11; there is a good deal of other correspondence scattered through the collection. A correspondence case of papers concerned with the use of alum in foods now forms the contents of Box 10.</p>
         <p>These papers were transferred to Manuscripts and Archives in 1952. They were given to the Yale Medical School Library by the estate of Frank P. Underhill.</p>
