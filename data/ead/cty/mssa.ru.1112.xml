         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The Office of the Provost was created by vote of the Yale Corporation in 1919. The establishment of the office was part of a general University reorganization plan that was submitted to the Corporation by the Committee on Educational Policy. By the term of Provost Edgar S. Furniss (1937-1958), the office had evolved to essentially its present-day function. The provost is the chief academic officer of the University, responsible for administering all of the internal operations of the University concerned with education and research.</p>
         <p>J. Lloyd Suttle, Deputy Provost for Academic Resources, has been a member of the Yale community for 43 years. He has held his current position since 2001, and previously served as Associate Provost, Adviser to the President, Dean of Administrative and Student Affairs in Yale College, Director of the Office of Institutional Research, and Lecturer in the Yale School of Management. He is author and co-editor of Improving Life at Work: Behavioral Science Approaches to Institutional Change. His present duties include oversight of Yale College, the Graduate School, the Department of History, the Council of Masters, the University Library, the Department of Athletics, and Information Technology Services. Mr. Suttle is a member of the Yale College Class of 1969 (Ezra Stiles) and received his M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale.</p>
