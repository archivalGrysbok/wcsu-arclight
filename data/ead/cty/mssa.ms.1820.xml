         <p>White Brothers, and Clark, Hall and Peck were the two New Haven law firms most active in real property law between the 1860s and 1982. The firm of White Brothers dates from the 1820s, when Henry White was admitted to the New Haven County Bar. White married Martha Sherman, the granddaughter of Roger Sherman, in 1830. Four of his sons eventually joined him in the practice of law. Clark, Hall and Peck was founded in the 1890s by James Gardiner Clark, Henry A. L. Hall, and George Leete Peck. White Brothers and Clark, Hall and Peck merged to form a single law firm in 1974. The firm of Clark, Hall and Peck and White Brothers dissolved in 1982.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Clark, Hall, and Peck and White Brothers records consist of abstracts of title, index card locator files, atlases, maps, probate extracts, project files, and grantor-grantee files. The collection primarily deals with properties located in the cities and towns of New Haven County, Connecticut including New Haven, Ansonia, Bethany, Branford, Cheshire, Clinton, Derby, Durham, East Haven, Guilford, Hamden, Killingworth, Madison, Meriden, Milford, Naugatuck, North Branford, North Haven, Orange, Oxford, Prospect, Seymour, Wallingford, West Haven, and Woodbridge. Properties located in a number of other Connecticut cities and towns are also indexed by these materials. Abstracts of title are the most numerous types of documentation found in the records. The type and amount of materials relating to each property vary significantly.</p>
         <p>A title search is usually performed by an attorney in conjunction with the sale or mortgage of property. The searcher reviews the records contained in various offices of town clerks in order to reveal any encumbrances upon the property. The types of records maintained by town clerks would include deeds, mortgages, liens, rights of way, easements, restrictions, taxes, or other matters that might affect the use of the property. By examining the public records, the attorney could provide his client, usually the purchaser, with a "snapshot" of the legal status of the property, what interest did the seller have authority to convey, what encumbrances would there be if the property was purchased, and whether the buyer could use the property for the purpose he intended. In addition to recorded instruments such as deeds and mortgages, searchers also rely on probate records, vital statistics, and court records, since they disclose other obligations affecting the property. Generally, each instrument involved in a title search shows the owner [grantor or seller], the buyer [grantee], the date, the volume and page where it is recorded in the town clerk's office, the legal description of the property, and the particular terms of the instrument.</p>

               <p>This series contains abstracts of title searches by the White Brothers law firm, primarily between the 1880s and 1982. Since White Brothers was very involved in real estate transactions (particularly in New Haven County), there is significant documentation of property history, though all properties will not have a record.</p>
               <p>The records are arranged by city, city section, or town and are accessed by locating the street name on a map or card index file. The original document arrangement, as devised by the law firm, has been retained. Material relating to New Haven and its associated sections (Annex, Westville, and Fair Haven) appear first, followed by other Connecticut cities and towns. Within the arrangement of each city, city section, or town, abstracts of title are generally found in order of size of the documentation: folded, flat files, and project files. The amount of materials assembled for each tract determined whether they were gathered in folded bundles (small), flat files (medium), or project files (large). Although the largest number of properties will be represented among the folded bundles, the researcher should also examine the entries under the headings for flat files and project files to ensure that all materials in this series are located.</p>
               <p>The city of New Haven is divided into forty-three districts, as shown on the <ref xlink:actuate="onRequest"
                       xlink:href="http://digital.library.yale.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/1004_8/id/336/rec/2"
                       xlink:show="new">Map of New Haven and Suburbs</ref> (Series III, Box 2269). In addition, there are two other areas associated with New Haven that are also shown on this map. The Annex (the area east of New Haven Harbor and the Quinnipiac River)is District 50, and Westville (to the northwest of New Haven) is District 70. The properties in Fair Haven are depicted in a plot map book in Box 387. Other Connecticut cities and towns are arranged alphabetically after the New Haven flat and project files.</p>
               <p>In the case of New Haven addresses, the map should be examined closely to determine which district a particular street has been assigned. Sections of streets may be assigned to different districts depending upon which side of the street a property is located, or the specific address. After locating the district number, the researcher should look in the box listing under that number to find the box containing the desired street. Within the box of folded abstracts, the researcher will generally find the properties arranged alphabetically by street name.</p>
               <p>The researcher should be particularly aware that the abstracts are "snapshots" of the status of property titles at a particular time and that property configurations and addresses may have changed over time. In some cases, the finding aid provides a range of several numerical addresses rather than a single address. In other cases, materials may be found in "non-street number" files, a term used when abstracts indicate a street name, but not a particular number on the street. In addition, properties that abutted two streets may have abstracts under headings for either or both streets.</p>
               <p>In addition to the folded files, researchers are encouraged to review the listing of flat files, both alphabetical (beginning with box 439) and non-alphabetical (beginning with box 450) to ascertain if there is any further documentation. Finally, there are five project files to consult (beginning with box 467): Dixwell-Whalley Avenue (properties located behind Yale University's Payne Whitney gymnasium taken to construct a public housing project), Interstate 91 (properties utilized to create Interstate 91), Oak Street Connector (properties used to link the Yale-New Haven Hospital with Interstates 91 and 95), Tontine Hotel (intersection of Church and Court Streets), and the Yale Bowl.</p>
               <p>Information on properties that are not located in New Haven, or its associated sections (Annex, Westville, and Fair Haven), are found in the files for other Connecticut cites and towns. These materials follow the New Haven files (beginning in box 483) and are arranged alphabetically by city or town name. The records for Ansonia, Bethany, Branford, Cheshire, Clinton, Derby, Durham, Guilford, Killingworth, Madison, North Branford, Orange, Wallingford, and Woodbridge consist of index card locator files, folded abstracts, miscellaneous records, and flat files. To find the file for a particular address, the researcher should consult the index card locator boxes which are arranged alphabetically by street. If a card for a particular address exists, it will have a number assigned by the law firm in the top corner of the card corresponding to the folded abstract or flat file. Using this number, the researcher would look in the finding aid under the appropriate town to determine whether the abstract is in a box containing folded files or flat files. As with the New Haven materials, the researcher must review folded, flat files (numbered/ unnumbered or alphabetical), and miscellaneous files to obtain all materials related to the specific property.</p>
               <p>Documentation from East Haven, Hamden, Milford, North Haven, and West Haven contain only folded abstracts, miscellaneous records, and flat files. There is no index card locator. The folded abstracts are arranged alphabetically by street. The flat files for these towns are arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>A partial index to grantor (seller)-grantee (purchaser) files appears towards the end of the White Brothers series. If an individual or company owned several parcels of property, it was sometimes more convenient for the law firm to arrange the abstracts together by the name of the grantor (seller) rather than to keep them in the district and street order arrangement. The alphabetical index by grantor surname is found at the front of the first box of the grantor-grantee files located in box 935.</p>
               <p>Unidentified flat files and probate records are located at the end of the town or the series.</p>
               <p>Oversize indices and map books that may be useful in research are found in Series III.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series contains documentation of title searches performed by Clark, Hall, and Peck, primarily between the 1890s and 1982. Since Clark, Hall, and Peck was, along with White Brothers, one of the leading real estate law firms, there are records relating to most, though not all, substantial projects and developers in the New Haven County area.</p>
               <p>The original arrangement of the Clark, Hall, and Peck records has been retained. Although this series follows a geographic district arrangement similar to the White Brothers series, the two firms had different methods of accessing their files. Like the White Brothers series, the entries related to New Haven and its associated areas (Annex, Westville, and an additional area known as District A) appear first, followed by other Connecticut cities and towns. Within the arrangement for each city or town, abstracts of title are found in order of size of the documentation, i.e. folded or flat files. The amount of materials assembled for each tract determined whether they are located in folded bundles (small) or flat files (medium). Unlike the White Brothers series, there are no project files. Although the largest number of properties will be represented among the folded bundles, the researcher should also examine the entries under the flat file heading to ensure that all materials are located.</p>
               <p>Materials are arranged by a geographic district system similar to the White Brothers series. New Haven is organized into a system of forty-three districts (1-43), but there are no records for district 34. In addition, there are three other areas associated with New Haven: the Annex (the area east of New Haven Harbor and the Quinnipiac River) is District 50, Westville (the area to the northwest of New Haven) is District 70, and District A (area near the New Haven-Hamden town lines). The records from New Haven's Westville section follow those from the Annex (beginning with box 1184), while abstracts of title from District A appear after the Westville records (beginning with box 1253A). Other Connecticut cities and towns are arranged alphabetically beginning with box 1323.</p>
               <p>For New Haven and some of the other cities and towns, there are alphabetical index card locator files for the streets. In the box listing, the researcher should locate the appropriate town and then find the index card locator file box containing the cards for the desired street. When consulting the index card box, the researcher will find that the cards are filed alphabetically by street name. If there is a card for a particular property, the researcher will find a code in one of the upper corners. The number includes the district designation along with a number assigned by the law firm to that particular property. Examples of the numeration are 3-259, Annex 2-653, Annex 47, or Westville 2943. Once the code is found, the researcher would refer back to the box listing (under the abstracts of title heading) to find which box contains the materials associated with the particular code number.</p>
               <p>In addition to the folded abstracts, the researcher should also review the listings for flat files (numerical and alphabetical), owner name files, and miscellaneous files for the specific town so all materials from this series may be located. Flat files (numerical and alphabetical) for New Haven and its associated areas are arranged beginning with box 1254. At the end of the New Haven alphabetical flat files, there is a unique alphabetical index card file indicating records of actions taken by the Board of Aldeman and City Engineering Department by street name (box 1321).</p>
               <p>Records from other Connecticut cities and towns, arranged alphabetically, appear after the end of the New Haven and associated areas records. Available materials vary by town, but can include an atlas or map book, index card locator files (street and owner), folded abstracts, and flat files. The procedure for accessing these files depends upon the particular aids available for a specific town but is similar to locating New Haven properties.</p>
               <p>The researcher should be aware that some Town of Orange records were commingled with West Haven's District 14 records. West Haven is the only municipality, other than New Haven, in which the abstracts are organized by a district system (Districts 1-14). After 1964, Clark, Hall, and Peck began to consistently use the designation Orange for all records from that town and the term West Haven for all abstracts from West Haven's numerical districts. The West Haven records are arranged as follows: abstracts from West Haven numerical districts 1-14, flat files from the numerical districts, West Haven flat files, and flat files from Orange when those records were included in West Haven's District 14.</p>
               <p>Another index card locator file (box 2134) containing an alphabetical listing of all the names of property owners (individuals and businesses) for whom Clark, Hall and Peck performed title searches is found after the records for other Connecticut cities and towns. Each index card lists the numbers of all abstracts which correspond to that person's or firm's name.</p>
               <p>Probate records are located at the end of the Clark, Hall and Peck series. An alphabetical index card file of last names is followed by the probate file extracts, also arranged alphabetically by last name.</p>
               <p>Oversize indices and map books that may be useful in research are found in Series III.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series contains indices, atlases, and maps that White Brothers and Clark, Hall and Peck maintained to assist them in performing title searches. Both the handwritten and typed indicies were superseded by the index card filing system and do not have much current utility. The atlases and maps range from 1888 to the middle of the twentieth century and are of historical value since some depict detailed information about the built environment and land ownership patterns.</p>
               <p>Handwritten and typed indices for abstracts of title appear first. They are generally arranged by city or town, and list each owner and a description of the property along with locator information such as an abstract number. This was superseded by the index card system.</p>
               <p>The New Haven land record and conveyance indices are brief summaries prepared by Clark, Hall, and Peck of land records found in the New Haven city clerk's office. Every entry lists the volume and page number where the particular document is found in the clerk's office, the names of the seller and buyer, the type of conveyance (warranty deed, lease, mortgage, etc.), and a description of the property. These volumes are incomplete and are of little value for accessing the records in the Clark, Hall, and Peck series.</p>
               <p>The handwritten probate index is an alphabetical listing of Clark, Hall and Peck's probate records which was superseded by the index card file of last names.</p>
               <p>The map books in the collection all belonged to the firm of Clark, Hall and Peck. Of most interest to the researcher will be the New Haven Atlas, which shows the district system used by the law firm; and the tax assessment volumes for Fair Haven, Westville, and West Haven. These last three volumes contain detailed area maps showing property and building lines.</p>
               <p>Other map books in the collection are of historical interest. The 1911 Atlas of New Haven, Connecticut contains maps that detail the city's layout and property owners. Maps, Volumes 1, 2, and 3, contain a combination of manuscript and printed maps, some of which are handcolored. They date from the 1860s and 1870s through the mid-portion of the twentieth century. The maps detail housing developments; lots for sale and auction in New Haven; different areas of the city, and the surrounding towns; and notable properties, such as mansions, farms, and factories. An untitled 500 page folio volume contains manuscripts sketches of various areas of New Haven, and handwritten notes regarding property ownership.</p>
               <p>Individual maps used by both law firms are found at the end of Series III.</p>
