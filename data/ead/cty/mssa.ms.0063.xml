The papers consist chiefly of records connected with the operation of their schooner, Live Oak (1823-1851) and financial and legal papers relating to land transactions in Fairfield, Connecticut (1800-1846). Also included are a small amount of family correspondence, genealogical materials, financial records of the First Congregational Society of Black Rock, earning and expense records of the Danbury and Norwalk Railroads, and accounts for a farm in Black Rock (1836-1885).</abstract>

         <p>A collection of letters, deeds, and other papers, 1795-1928, of the family of Captain Thomas Bartram, 1771-1838, of Black Rock, Fairfield, Connecticut. Catain Bartram was a shipmaster and was joined in this business, and later succeeded by his sons, Joseph and Thomas Burr Bartram, who were merchants and associated in the shipping business with Sturges and Clearman.</p>

         <p>In addition there are 33 bills, receipts, etc., 1848-1851, dealing with the affairs of the first Congregational society of Black Rock, Connecticut, of which Thomas Burr Bartram was treasurer.</p>
         <p>There are 40 deeds, 1800-1846, all to land in Black Rock or Fairfield, Connecticut, unless otherwise indicated.

Two are to Thomas Burr Bartram from: John G. West, June 28, 1838; William Wheeler, December 30, 1846. The remaining two are: from Captain Thomas Bartram to Joseph Bartram, October 15, 1829, and from Linus K. and Samuel Henshaw, March 30, 1826. There are 3 undated maps and surveys for unspecified lands.</p>
         <p>Three other papers include two powers of attorney to Captain Thomas Bartram: from his niece, Mary Wheeler Bartram, 1804-, June 10, 1825; from Ebenezer Bartram, 1762-, in the estate of Isaac Jennings, March 22, 1822; and an agreement October 8, 1810, between Captain Thomas Bartram and William Wheeler for a fence line.</p>
         <p>Five account books and two checkbooks, 1820-1928, consist of the following:</p>
         <p>Day book, 1820-1827, of Joseph Bartram, b. 1800, shipmaster of Black Rock, Connecticut. The entries deal with the sale of the cargo of the schooner "Live Oak", which consisted mostly of shoes, grain, beans, and fish. The entries were made in Black Rock, Fairfield, Salem, Massachusetts, and New York City.</p>
         <p>Three Account books of Thomas Burr Bartram, 1803-1886, as follows: Day Book, 1827-1830, kept in New York, Salem and Boston; Day book, 1830-1831, has accounts similar to the above. There are also entries in this volume for 1862-1863 and 1872. Several pages and parts of pages torn out, and a considerable amount of scribbling in the front and back of the volume. Account Book with mixed day book and ledger entries, 1836-1885, consists primarily of farm accounts in Black Rock. The entries deal with charges for the use of team, payment of workers, and the sale of farm produce, wood, and meat. There are also charges for wharfage, and some of the later accounts deal with dividends. The volumes also include undated but detailed information on the financial condition, earnings, and expenses of the Danbury &amp; Norwalk Railroad.</p>
         <p>Two books of check stubs, 1881-1883 and 1883-1886, the latter lacking a cover. Some of the entries on these stubs are in Thomas Burr Bartram's hand, but the writer of the greater part of them is unidentified as is the bank upon which the checks were drawn.</p>
         <p>Records, 1918-1928 and undated, of the securities of Alice Anna Bartram, Thomas Burr Bartram's daughter, and possibly of her mother, Ann Marie (Burr) Bartram. Most of this volume is blank.</p>
         <p>7 volumes – 31 x 10, 29 x 16, 40 x 15, 39 x 15, 23 x 33, 21 x 15 (in folder), and 20 x 16 cm.</p>
