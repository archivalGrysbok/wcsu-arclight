The original audio produced varied in size, file format, and file naming conventions.  Many recordings were split into multiple parts by the original digital recording devices (logical files). Processed master files were created by merging the separate parts and normalizing into standard file formats. In some cases, naming conventions of the originals may have resulted in processed masters and use copies that were created in the incorrect order.  When available, refer to the transcript for guidance in determing order of the recordings. Transcripts refer to the original audio files when providing contextual notes (e.g. [END TAPE 1]). </materialspec>

                  <p>Richard Abbatiello recalls how urban renewal affected his life as a child growing up in New Haven. He was born on Chestnut Street in the East Street neighborhood, living above his father's machine shop, which his father started after leaving the A.C. Gilbert factory. Urban renewal forced the business to move to North Haven, and the family to move to Fair Haven Heights. Abbatiello discusses how the move affected him and the differences between the two neighborhoods, and reflects on his friend groups, working as a teenager in the family business, ethnic diversity, the roll of the Farnham Neighborhood House, and the merits of urban renewal. He also talks about his childhood admiration for Yale athletes like Johnny Lee and Albie Booth, and how that shaped his perception of the University.</p>

                  <p>Shafiq Abdussabur grew up in the Dixwell neighborhood in New Haven in the 1970s. Abdussabur recalls that Dixwell was not unified neighborhood. Although the street was almost entirely African-American, lines of geography and class were readily apparent to most residents. He suggests that there were effectively five distinct neighborhoods on Dixwell, and that class and geographical snobbery ran rampant among Dixwell residents, particularly the children with whom Abdussabur grew up. There was a key difference, he recalls, between people who were "poor" -- single parent families, living in the Elm Haven projects, on welfare -- and those who were just "broke." Abdussabur's family fell into the latter class. Despite these class divisions, he recalls that community life in the Dixwell area was vibrant, with lots of opportunity for kids and many positive Africa-American role models. It was, he says, "really a black-empowered zone from Dixwell all the way up." Abdussabur now works for the New Haven Police Department.</p>

                  <p>Fred Acquavita started teaching in the New Haven Public Schools in 1968, part of a crop of young, radical teachers to enter the New Haven schools at that time. He discusses his radicalization as a teacher and member of the teachers' union, the New Haven Federation of Teachers, in which he served in leadership positions. He describes his conflicts with the Board of Education and "conservative" teachers, describes his attempts at progressive teaching in various schools across the city, and offers his perspectives on education and unionization.</p>

Alderman discusses the nature of the scrap metal business, and Jewish and family businesses in general.

                  <p>Theresa Argento recalls life before and during urban renewal in Wooster Square. One of seven children born to Italian immigrant Nadio Carrano, Argento offers memories of the neighborhood and family life pre-redevelopment -- comparisons to life in Amalfi, the role of the Sargent Hardware Company in the neighborhood, trips to Lighthouse Point, Lucibello's Pastry Shop, and to New York City to see Frank Sinatra sing. Her family owned Carrano's produce market on Chapel Street, which was demolished in the course of construction of interstate 91. Argento describes being evicted from the family's home above the store, and moving with her mother to the Annex section of New Haven. She also describes how redevelopment affected the St. Andrews Society, an Italian fraternal organization, and St. Michael's Church. Argento often gathers with other former neighborhood residents to reminisce about the old neighborhood at events like the Saint Andrews Feast and the Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival.</p>

                  <p>Norma Barbieri, the daughter of Italian immigrants, grew up in the Wooster Square neighborhood. She describes her father's decision to immigrate and his enduring love for the Italian language. Barbieri spoke Italian at home, but recalls being forced to speak English in school. She tells how as a child she played with being bilingual, laughing at her mother as she read the comics aloud in broken English, or how Barbieri gave nicknames to all the neighborhood characters.Theresa Argento, sitting in on the interview, offers her own related reminiscences, and Barbieri and Argento together describe their efforts to have Italian taught in local schools, and recall stories about growing up in Wooster Square, and how the neighborhood changed over the course of their lives, particularly after urban renewal.</p>

                  <p>Marvin Bargar grew up in New Haven's Legion Avenue neighborhood, graduated from Hillhouse High School in 1943, then returned to New Haven in 1950 after serving in the Army and graduating from the University of Connecticut. He discusses growing up in New Haven's Jewish community, the changes to the Legion Avenue neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s, and his current efforts to preserve the city's Jewish history. Bargar first recalls his childhood in the Legion Avenue area. Most of the families in the area were Jewish or Italian American and lived in two- or three-family homes. He then proceeds to talk about the changing face of the neighborhood after World War II and suburban flight. As families became more affluent, they purchased cars and moved to single-family homes in the suburbs. Bargar, his wife, and children moved to Westville in the late 1950s but, dissatisfied with the schools, they moved to Hamden in 1968. Bargar laments Richard Lee's redevelopment projects because he believes that they destroyed Jewish community and businesses in the Legion Avenue and Oak Street areas. Bargar also discusses his work with the Jewish Historical Society, part of Southern Connecticut University's Ethnic Heritage Center, and his interest in repairing and restoring the Orchard Street Synagogue.</p>

                  <p>Betsy Barnston was born in the East Rock neighborhood to a German-Jewish family, descendents of what she describes as the original 1853 Jewish immigrant to New Haven. She describes the balance her family attempted to strike between remaining Jewish and assimilating to Christian culture. She talks about not being able to join the New Haven Lawn Club, and tensions between the Jews from Germany, who came to New Haven in the 19th century, and those from Eastern Europe who came later and tended, in her estimation, to be less assimilated and more religiously observant. Barnston describes her experiences at a Jewish summer camp, and also her family's move to Hamden in the context of other families she knew moving to the suburbs. The interview focuses around Barston's synagogue, Mishkan Israel, which moved from Audubon Street in New Haven to Hamden. Barnston also talks admiringly about Mishkan Israel's Rabbi Robert Goldburg, who was active in the civil rights movement and invited Stokely Carmichael to speak at the temple, and mentions her own involvement in the inter-racial organization The Group.</p>

                  <p>Doug Bethea grew up in the Dixwell neighborhood. After graduating from high school, he decided to give something back the community, and organized the National Drill Team and Drum Squad, a drill team designed to give New Haven young adults an opportunity to see the world and a reason to stay off the streets. Although Bethea guesses that he has helped 2000 local kids over the years, he says that he is "very disappointed with the way the city is now, with the way that the area is now." Bethea compares the Dixwell neighborhood he sees and lives in today -- gun crime, drugs, no control or respect -- with the community he remembers from his childhood. Bethea discusses the sense of family and community that suffused that area during his childhood, and mourns the loss of this feeling. Attempts to improve life in the community by legislative or political means are doomed to failure, Bethea suggests, until residents of Dixwell rediscover the meaning of family and community. He also discusses the loss of his son to gun violence.</p>

                  <p>Anthony Bialecki was a student at the un-school of New Haven in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Born in 1953, Bialecki grew up in Fair Haven but his family moved to North Haven when he began high school. A self-described member of the counterculture, Bialecki dropped out of high school during his sophomore year and, against his father's wishes, began to attend the un-school of New Haven, a small alternative school with commitments to political activism and community involvement. Bialecki discusses his time in high school and his interest in antiwar and civil rights activism. Much of the interview focuses on the Black Panthers and Bialecki's impressions of them as a white activist. He considers their relation to women, to older generations of African American activists, and to white political groups. He also talks about the Women's movement, the Weathermen, the American Independent Movement, and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Bialecki recounts the May 1, 1970 May Day demonstrations, which occurred when he was a student at the un-school. He describes the events that day, the speakers who attended, the response of the university, and the significance of the protests, especially in light of more violent contemporary events such as Kent State. Bialecki touches on his experiences in the Local 35 union at Yale, Yale's politics at the time, and the relationship between Yale students and local activist groups. He also compares youth political activism today to that of the 1960s.</p>

                  <p>Bret Bissell moved to New Haven in the mid-1960s as an intern for the National Assocation of Intergroup Relations. He eventually became executive director of the Human Relations Council in New Haven. After this group folded, Bissell, a self-described "social engineer," worked for a number of federally funded agencies, dealing at various points with integration, community planning, and housing. He discusses New Haven's years as a "model city," when the city served as the test subject for dozens of state and federal programs. Bissell calls New Haven's redevelopment project "well-managed," but he recognizes that it tore communities apart and encouraged white flight to the suburbs. Given his work, Bissell had an opportunity to view first-hand the relocation of New Haven families during redevelopment, and he spends a great deal of time discussing the effects of these relocation on the city, on its neighborhoods, and on public housing. He also discusses his family history, which includes a Civil Rights activist mother and a brother in the Weather Underground.</p>

                  <p>Virginia Blaisdell moved to New Haven in 1962 after graduating from Wellesley College and became involved in the American Independent Movement. Blaisdell left that group in the early 1970s as she became involved in feminist politics. Her interview focuses on her experiences as a feminist and her relationships with other political activist groups. Blaisdell discusses her impressions of the American Independent Movement and the Black Panthers, both of which she felt were too male-dominated. She also talks about the whiteness of the women's movement and the tensions between African American rights groups and women's rights groups. In the 1970s, Blaisdell participated in a womens' liberation rock band, helped organize New Women's and Our Bodies courses, and helped women access abortions. Her interview also discusses her contentious relationships with the New Haven Police Department and Yale University. Blaisdell was one of forty women who successfully sued the city of New Haven for illegal wiretapping activities. Blaisdell currently works for the unions at Yale, and talks about her belief in the university's tendency to be conservative and resistant to reforms. Blaisdell also talks about her experience as a photographer and her work for the New Haven Advocate.</p>

                  <p>John Bontatibus was born in Clinton Avenue in the Chatham Square section of Fair Haven in 1932, which was then known as "Clam Town." Bontatibus remembers working on his father's milk farm in Branford, and making deliveries around the New Haven area. Bontatibus dwells on the variety of childhood activities available around Fair Haven: street games after school, playing in Indian Cave in Fair Haven Heights, ice skating in Hollywood Park, being in the Boy Scouts, going to Savin Rock in West Haven, dances at the Atwater Training School. He also recalls how the combination of Dutch Elm Disease and the Great 1938 Hurricane destroyed most of New Haven's Elm trees. He talks about the neighborhood's ups and downs since the 1980s, focusing on differences between renters and homeowners, and talks about the work of the Chatham Square Neighborhood Association. He also discusses his view of how race relations have evolved over the years.</p>

                  <p>Arthur Brandenberg came to Yale in 1961 to serve as chaplain to Methodist students and took part in antiwar and civil rights activism on campus until he left in 1971. On the verge of being fired from Duke University for his liberal racial views, Brandenberg accepted an invitation from William Sloan Coffin, Jr., the University Chaplain, to come to Yale. Brandenberg discusses the religious community at Yale in the 1960s and the community and national activism of the campus ministries. Brandenberg took an active part in the Yale Religious Ministry, a coalition of Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic groups at Yale that became involved in social politics in the 1960s. Brandenberg remembers the student organizing initiatives by undergraduates Peter Countrymen and Joseph Lieberman and law student Maryanne Wright. He also tells the story of his arrest in St. Augustine Florida, where he and several other members of the Yale Religious Ministry were jailed after a civil rights protest. He talks at great length about Coffin and about Yale President Kingman Brewster and praises their liberal views on civil rights and their activism. Brandenberg also discusses his perception of the Black Panthers, an organization that he believed was too militant.</p>

                  <p>Lillian Brown discusses life in the African-American community located in the Newhallville and Dixwell neighborhoods of New Haven. Brown moved into her home in Newhallville in 1953, and remained for the next five decades. She raised six children, and worked at the Winchester rifle factory. She discusses the changes wrought by urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s, changes that she feels were not for the best. Brown feels particular ire for the adminsitration of mayor Richard Lee, whose urban renewal projects, she feels, disregarded the needs of the black community and left huge holes in the Newhallville landscape. Brown's opposition to urban renewal led her to become more active in city politics, culminating in her election as City Treasurer in early 1970s. She discusses the strategies used by black politicians and civic leaders to better the lives of their constituents in the face of a frequently hostile city government. Brown comments on the long-term changes in the landscape and community of Newhallville, including the construction of housing projects and the disappearance of small businesses.</p>

                  <p>Sydney Bruskin was born in Ansonia, CT, moved to New Haven as child, and remained in the city for most of his life. The child of immigrant Jewish parents, Sydney completed elementary school in New Haven before enrolling at Hillhouse High School. Bruskin describes the life of a high school student in New Haven in the 1930s, focusing on his friends (mostly the children of Jewish immigrants), classes, and ex-curricular activies. After graduating from Hillhouse, he attended Yale, but, due to the depression, was forced to live at home and commute to school. He discusses the difficulties caused by these circumstances, as well as the anti-semitism faced at Yale. Bruskin Majored in French, but had trouble finding a teaching job during the Depression. After borrowing a bit of money from his father, Bruskin opened a bicycle rental and repair shop on Chapel Street.</p>

                  <p>Guido Calabresi was raised in New Haven, and received his BA from Yale College and his JD from Yale Law School. Calabresi discusses his connections to the Tyler Cooper law firm, a "progressive" firm, according to Calabresi, with deep roots in the New Haven community. Morris Tyler (Calabresi's father-in-law) was involved with the Dixwell Community House, while his partner Jim Cooper started the New Haven Foundation and Legal Aid in New Haven. Calabresi discusses the way in which lawyers can act a "force of good" in their communities, suggesting that this is the largest significance of jurists such as Cooper and Tyler. The Tyler Cooper firm would represent the city of New Haven in their "redevelopment" (i.e. Urban Renewal) plans in the 1960s and 1970s. Calabresi also discusses changes in the orientation of Yale Law School, suggesting that a localism and connection to New Haven that characterized an earlier generation of Law students has given way to a more national focus.</p>

                  <p>Edna Carnegie, the daughter of immigrants from Nevis (in the Caribbean), taught English in New Haven public schools for 25 years. She was among the first African Americans to teach in the New Haven public school system. Carnegie attended college at St. Augustine's Episcopal College in Raleigh, NC. She talks about going to college during the Great Depression, a luxury that was only made possible by the generosity of Carnegie's church in New Haven. She also talks about her experiences on segregated public transportation in the Jim Crow South. Along with her teaching, Carnegie was active in church and community organizations. She taught Sunday School for 40 years at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in New Haven, where she was also involved in the Girls Friendly Society. The Friendly Society allowed Carnegie to travel abroad on a number of occassions, including trips to Europe, Australia, and Israel. Carnegie was a founding member of Dwight Development Corporation, which was involved in community activism and organizing in the Dwight Street area, and was an active participant in the New Haven NAACP and the Civil Rights struggle.</p>

                  <p>Erna Carron has spent the better part of her life on Chatham Street, in Fair Haven. She was born and raised there, and, for the past 55 years, has lived one house down from the one in which she grew up. She discusses the "mom and pop" stores in the Chatham Street area, and the make-up of the community when she was young. She talks about her childhood friends and activities, and discusses the differences and similarities between her upbringing on Chatham Street and her children's'. Carron grew up in a German-speaking household, and compares this to the growing Spanish-speaking presence in Fairhaven today. Half-way through the interview, David Carron (Erna's son) joins in. He continues the conversation, talking about his childhood on Chatham Street, and the linguistic and cultural lines that divide Fair Haven.</p>

                  <p>Father John Casey grew up in the East Rock neighborhood of New Haven, attending St. Joseph's Parish on Edwards Street. After attending public schools in New Haven, Father Casey enrolled in Seminary and was sent to a number of parishes in the Hartford Diocese before his assignment to St. Boniface's in New Haven. Casey talks about history of Catholicism in New Haven, focusing in particular on the ethnic and national divisions within the city's Catholic population. At one time, Casey recalls, there were six Catholic parishes within two blocks of each other, each catering to a different national group -- Irish, Italian, French, German, Polish, and Lithuanian. The shifting demographics of New Haven, however, have forced the closure of a number of churches and have dulled the ethnic identities of those that have remained. Although St. Boniface had once been the "German church," Casey recalls, its parishioners were now mostly ethnic Italians. These changes, Casey says, are not necessarily for the worse, but mark an important change from an era in which Catholicism and ethnicity were central features of daily life for many New Haven residents.</p>

                  <p>Robert Cavanagh was born and raised in Framingham, Massachusetts. He attended Yale College, then Yale Law School, graduating in 1959. Although he considered work in New York, Cavanagh accepted a job at Wiggin and Dana, a New Haven firm, after receiving his degree. Cavanagh's arrival coincided with the era of redevelopment in New Haven, spear-headed by Mayor Richard Lee and administrator Edward Logue. Cavanagh denies that redevelopment played much of a role in his decision to practice in New Haven, but brokering deals between the city and landowners formed much of his work. Cavanagh recognizes that the redevelopment effort failed in a number of important ways, but refuses to condemn Lee and Logue for their efforts. They were, he says, trying to do a good thing for the city of New Haven. Cavanagh also talks about his years practicing law, some of his favoite cases, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of a law career in a smaller city such as New Haven.</p>

                  <p>Henry "Sam" Chauncey Jr. was Special Assistant to Yale President Kingman Brewster during the 1970 Black Panther trials and May Day demonstrations and later became Secretary of the University. He recalls the University's strategies and decisions in regard to the demonstrations. Brewster and many faculty members, Chauncey explains, believed that the May Day demonstrators should be protected but that violence and riots should be averted at all cost. He discusses his collaboration with New Haven Chief of Police Jim Ahearn and their joint attempts to maintain order. He tells a story of preventing the Weathermen from coming for the demonstrations by arranging for their buses to be sabotaged and explains that this was done to avert a riot. Chauncey discusses the Black Panthers, who he believes were fundamentally good and not prone to violence. Rather, he explains, they represented just one part of the revolutionary climate of the day. Chauncey also describes his suspicion that President Richard Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell conspired to blow up Yale's ice rink and Peace Building as part of their assault on liberal universities and the Eastern Establishment. He assesses Yale's changing relationship with the community in the early 1970s, its attempts to foster better community relations, and the internal reforms to admissions and curriculum that took place under Brewster.</p>

                  <p>Francis Clark is an alderwoman in New Haven, the former Executive Director of the Arts Council and a Staff Member of the Connecticut Commission on the Arts. Clark was born and raised in New York City, and came to New Haven in 1956. She discusses Mayor Richard Lee's redevelopment programs in the 1960s, focusing specifically on the development of Audubon Street. As part of the city's efforts to revive its downtown, leading New Haven citizens fought for the construction of an arts center, to be located on Audubon Street. After a flurry of work in the 1960s, the Audubon program stalled for a decade. It was resumed in the 1980s, and now stands as a center of the arts in downtown New Haven, housing the Arts Council and the Neighborhood Music School. Clark recognizes that the redevelopment efforts failed in many important ways, including an insensitivity to pre-existing community structures, but she insists that the developers' intentions were noble. Clark mentions that she has lived through three periods in which a tangible excitement and a sense of possibility filled the city of New Haven: the redevelopment years of the 1960s; the early 1980s, when aspects of redevelopment left unfinished were picked up again; and recent years.</p>

                  <p>Curtis Cofield came to New Haven in 1965 to serve as Pastor for the Immanuel Baptist Church, on Chapel Street. Cofield describes the challenges of being a pastor of a predominantly middle-class, African-American congregation in the midst of the Civil Rights movement. His congregation, he explains, did not expect him to be radical and Cofield took a moderate liberal stance on many issues. He discusses the intimidation he experienced from the Black Panthers and other more radical groups. He opposed the violence and destruction that he believed characterized their message. Cofield labored to bridge gaps in the community through inter-congregational collaboration. He talks a bit about the May Day demonstrationsand the attempts to improve racial relations in their aftermath. He also talks about the economic aspects of the Civil Rights movement.</p>

                  <p>Marvin Cohen was born and raised in New Haven, and, after college, returned to the city to open a nursery. Asked by Art Spiegel (creator of the graphic novel Maus) to design a Holocaust memorial for New Haven. Cohen offered a simple design, featuring a Star of David and thirteen evergreen trees. His sketch was supplemented with work by architect Gus Franzoni, and the memorial placed on Whalley Avenue near Edgewood Park. Cohen describes the difficulties in finding an appropriate place for the memorial, and a number of challenges from within the Jewish community regarding the propriety and design of the monument. Cohen shares a number of his scrapbooks and his memorabilia with the interviewer.</p>

                  <p>John Daniels was mayor of New Haven between 1990 and 1994. He was born and raised in the city, and attended Villanova University on a football scholarship. He credits his interest in politics to two distinct events: a meeting with New Haven Mayor Dick Lee when Daniels was a senior in High School, and Daniels' volunteer work on John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960. His political career began with a spot on the Board of Alderman, as a replacement Alderman for the 19th Ward. At that time, the 19th was the only ward represented by an African-American alderperson. Daniels served as an Alderman for 16 years, then served 10 years as State Senator, and finally 4 years as Mayor of New Haven. Daniels talks about the place of African Americans in the New Haven community, suggesting that many white people in the city are invested in keeping black people relegated to the bottom rungs of society. Even during his four years as Mayor, Daniels says, African Americans never really had control of the city. Daniels bemaons the current state of the city of New Haven, noting the lack of dissenting voices against the policies of Mayor John DeStefano, and describing what he sees as a concerted attempt to run poor Hispanics and African Americans out of the city in order to return New Haven to a white majority.</p>

                  <p>Che Dawson was born and raised in Bridgeport, CT, but retained close ties to the New Haven community. In 1994, while in college, Dawson took a summer job as a counselor at LEAP (Leadership, Education, and Athletics in Parternship) in the Church Street South neighborhood of New Haven. LEAP was founded in 1992. The experience changed Dawson's life and career path, and after college, Dawson returned to New Haven to work full time with LEAP. Dawson describes the manner in which the LEAP program affects not only the students and communities it serves, but its counselors and employees as well. Dawson learned the importance of self-sacrifice and commitment through the program. The secret to LEAP's success, Dawson suggests, is its continuing commitment to, and connection with, familes and communities. LEAP proved itself to be trustworthy and effective, and, in so doing, was able to integrate itself more deeply into the fabric of the communities it served. At the time of the interview, Dawson had left LEAP.</p>

                  <p>Harry Debenedet, the son of Italian immigrants, grew up in the Hill Section of New Haven before moving to North Haven at age 12. As an adult he worked as a police officer in New Haven County. Debenedet discusses his participation in several Italian American societies in New Haven, including the Marchegiano Society, the Saint Andrew Society, the Santa Maria Maddalena Society. Debenedet was also a founding member of the Police Order of Centurions, an Italian American fraternal organization. He gives the history of these groups, recounting that most began as mutual aid societies organized around the Italian town from which its members emigrated. Today, Debenedet notes, the remaining societies focus on connecting Italian Americans and preserving their national cultural heritage. Debenedet also talks about the Italian neighborhoods of New Haven, explaining that northern Italians tended to live in the Hill section while southern Italians lived in the Wooster Street area. He then discusses the effects of urban renewal (refrred to as redevelopment) on the Italian neighborhoods and communities of New Haven and states that it "destroyed" the Hill Neighborhood. The various societies, he suggests, help maintain connections among second and third generation Italian Americans.</p>

                  <p>Milton Devane was born in New Haven in 1929, attended Yale College in the late 1940s, and graduated from Yale Law School in 1958 after serving in the Navy during the Korean War. Devane then went on to work for the Tyler Cooper law firm in New Haven, which represented the New Haven Redevelopment Agency in the 1960s. Devane discusses the culture of Yale Law school in the 1950s and admits that he chose Yale in part because it was a less cutthroat and less traditional school than Harvard. He then discusses working for Morris Tyler and James Cooper. He describes them as great mentors to young lawyers and committed to the New Haven community and to the law profession. Much of the interview focuses on the Redevelopment Agency's activities and the relationships between Development Administrator Edward "Ed" Logue, the Tyler Cooper firm, and the New Haven community. Devane admits that some mistakes were made in New Haven's urban renewal activities but criticizes the "revisionists" who only find fault in redevelopment.</p>

                  <p>Pauline DiGioia grew up in Hamden in a working-class, Italian-American family. In the early 1950s she worked at the A.C. Gilbert toy factory as a secretary but left after three and a half years to raise her children. Nevertheless, DiGioia developed lifelong relationships with her colleagues, who came to call themselves the "Gilbert Girls." She remembers her years at A.C. Gilbert as very happy times and remarks that Gilbert cared a lot about his employees. She describes the yearly summer picnics and Christmas dinners that he organized for his employees and their families. DiGioia also talks about growing up in Hamden and recounts stories of being a child, going to the beach, and her family life at home. She talks about her Italian grandparents and Italian American parents and their hard-working natures. After leaving the A.C. Gilbert company, she took college courses in physical education, raised her children, and participated in the Hamden Women's Club and in several golf clubs. She also encouraged her daughters to take up swimming. After her husband retired, DiGioia worked as an administrative assistant at several jobs at Yale University. At the time of the interview, she resides in Branford, where she swims, golfs, volunteers, and enjoys her grandchildren.</p>

                  <p>Joe Dimow moved to New Haven in 1945 after being discharged from the army and became involved in political activism and community programs in the late 1950s and 1960s. Dimow and his wife first lived in the Hill section of New Haven and he worked in an automotive machine shop. Dimow had been the chair of the Communist Party in Hartford Connecticut and later became involved in the NAACP and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). He discusses how the McCarthy era and the subsequent rise of the New Left at the end of the 1950s changed the political climate in 1960s New Haven. The interview focuses on Dimow's experiences with African American politics and his community activities with the West Hills Neighborhood Corporation. He talks a great deal about the Black Panthers, whom he had mixed feelings about. While he admired their activities, he worried that they were too militant. Dimow also describes the relationship between the Black Panthers and the New Haven Jewish Community and discusses the issue of black anti-Semitism in the 1960s. He talks about the New Haven Black Panther trials, the administrations of Richard Lee and Edward Logue, and the liberal political activities of Rabbi Bob Goldburg and lawyer John Williams. He also discusses the ways that Yale University contributed to the "liberal stmosphere" of 1960s New Haven.</p>

                  <p>Edward Dobihal moved to Hamden in 1964 and spent his career in New Haven working at the Yale Divinity School and as Chaplain at Yale New Haven Hospital. He discusses the role of churches in the Civil Rights movement, in both New Haven and in the southern United States. He also talks about the changing relationship between New Haven's churches in the early 1970s. Dobihal came to Connecticut from Washington D.C., where he had participated in the 1963 March on Washington. A member of the First Methodist Church, Dobihal was part of a community of politically active church members in New Haven that included figures such as William Sloan Coffin. Dobihal talks about the climate Civil Rights movement and compares New Haven's political and racial climate to places he knew in the South, and also considers the different levels of church involvement in the movement in the North and the South. He touches on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, integration, the role of interfaith, interracial churches in the civil rights struggle, and other related issues. Dobihal then discusses the early 1970s and the tensions that split the New Haven Council of Churches. He took part in forming Downtown Cooperative Ministries, which became Interfaith Cooperative Ministries, after the 1970 May Day demonstrations. He talks about trying to unite congregations for social change across racial and faith lines, including the growing Black Muslim populations. Dobihal mentions that he was one of several New Haven residents whose phones were illegally wiretapped by the government in this era.</p>

                  <p>Henry Dynia worked for Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates, the architectural frim that designed the New Haven Coliseum. Dynia discusses the design of the Coliseum, mentioning that it was designed to compliment the existing Knights of Columbus building. He says that Kevin Roche designed the building during a "Brutalist, minimalist period" in architecture. He states that the Coliseum was a bold design for its time, something he believes the public has largely misunderstood. Dynia then discusses the problems that plagued the Coliseum after it opened in 1972. He blames the largely vacant Ninth Square neighborhood, fears of crime in the area, a lack of long-term planning for upgrades and improvements, and ineffective advertising for the Coliseum's disappointing existence and ultimate structural decline. But he also believes that the Coliseum and its parking spaces are important for New Haven and was upset when the mayor decided to demolish it before asking for more community input.</p>

                  <p>The Reverend Doctor Edwin Edmonds arrived in New Haven in 1959 to serve as Pastor for the Dixwell United Church of Christ and quickly became involved in African American political activities. Edmonds came to New Haven from Greensboro, North Carolina, where he had been a Professor of Sociology at Bennett College and President of the local branch of the NAACP. He took on a number of racial issues through his church and through the NAACP. Edmonds recounts his efforts to integrate New Haven's schools and the discrimination he faced in the attempt to find affordable housing and his wife's difficulties finding a job as a teacher. He states that the local trade unions and the White Citizens' Council, a coalition of businessmen, both tried to restrict African American access to jobs and job training. Edmonds appealed to Mayor Richard Lee to put pressure on these groups. This led to the establishment training programs for African Americans who wanted to learn a trade and efforts by Lee to integrate the New Haven police force. Edmonds also cofounded the group Community Progress Incorporated, which was created to organize citizens into local advisory groups who could make recommendations for community development initiatives and to lobby cooperatively for civic improvements and fixes for neighborhood problems. Edmonds also talks about the creation of Head Start in New Haven.</p>

                  <p>Walter G. Farr graduated from Yale College in 1948 and from Yale Law School in 1951. In 1955, after working in New York City, he returned to New Haven and joined the Tyler Cooper law firm, where he worked as part of the outside counsel to the New Haven Redevelopment Agency. Farr also served as the head of the New Haven Civil Liberties Union and the Treasurer of the Human Relations Council. His work involved negotiating real estate deals for eminent domain and ensuring the legality of building condemnation. He describes himself as a liberal lawyer, committed to public interest. The interview focuses on his experiences with and perceptions of the New Haven Redevelopment Agency, its key supporters, and its activities. Farr talks about the goals of Redevelopment Administrator Edward J. Logue and Mayor Richard C. Lee and the civic ideals of Morris Tyler, James Cooper, Ralph Taylor, Harold Grabino. Referring to Robert Dahl's book Who Governs, Farr states that "who governed was us" namely, the community of liberal lawyers in New Haven. He says that the Redevelopment Agency and its lawyers were optimistic in their ability to improve New Haven. But he admits that in retrospect there were some mistakes in urban renewal projects that hurt New Haven's communities. He also discusses the culture of the New Haven Bar. In 1962, Farr began work for the US Agency for International Development (USAID). He later taught at New York University, directed the Model Cities Administration, and worked for the federal government.</p>

                  <p>Henry Fernandez moved to New Haven in 1990 to attend Yale Law School then co-founded LEAP (Leadership, Education and Athletics in Partnership) and served as its Executive Director for the next six years. As a college student in Boston, Fernandez had worked in summer programs for children who lived in public housing. He wanted to establish similar programs in New Haven. With fellow Yale student Matt Klein and Law Professor Anne Calabresi, Fernandez started LEAP. The interview focuses on LEAP's formative years. Fernandez discusses the assistance of local philanthropists like Roz and Jerry Meyer. He also talks about organizing the program and the relationships that he forged with the New Haven Housing Authority and Board of Education. LEAP was organized to serve low-income youth, primarily those living in public housing, and to provide them with educational and athletic activities in the summer. Fernandez envisioned this program as a way to deter violence in neighborhoods such as Church Street South, Elm Haven, Newhallville, and Dwight Kensington. He also intended LEAP to build relationships between the New Haven community and students at six local colleges, whom LEAP recruited as counselors. Fernandez talks fund raising, organizing programs, and ensuring the safety of counselors. He concludes by discussing the public image he helped craft for LEAP: an organization of diverse people from different backgrounds working together to improve community life for children.</p>

                  <p>As the daughter of a Jamaican woman and a Cherokee man, Alba Fleming identifies herself as West Indian rather than African American. An academically motivated student who eventually graduated from Yale University, Fleming was a senior at Hillhouse High School when the 1967 race riot erupted there. Fleming talks about the climate of the school in 1967 and 1968, describes the events that occurred on the day of the riot, and shares her experiences as a person of color during that time. Fleming explains that most of her friends were white and that she did not share the resentments that African American students faced. She did not feel disrespected by the white administration and did not participate in groups such as the Black Student Union. She discusses the tense atmosphere that developed in the wake of the riot and her fear that she would be targeted ay African American students for her associations with white students. The interview touches on the spread of the riot to the New Haven community and the subsequent attacks on businesses. Fleming also assesses the decline in Hillhouse High School's academic reputation in the decade after the riot.</p>

                  <p>George Foote taught history at Hillhouse High School from 1962 until 1970, when he became one of the first ten teachers at High School in the Community, an alternative school founded in 1970. Following a race riot at Hillhouse High School in 1967, Foote began to think about ways to defuse the racial tensions in New Haven's integrating public school system. He presented the idea for an alternative high school to fellow teachers and to the New Haven Board of Education, which he describes as a very progressive body in the late 1960s. Thanks to federal grants available for alternative schools through Title Three, Foote raised money to begin the school. Foote describes the teachers as mostly middle-class radicals and says that he was the only working-class teacher of the group. All, however, were committed to changing the educational system. High School in the Community attracted leaders of the Black Student Union at Hillhouse High School, including such students as Ronnie Barnes, its leader. Foote believed that the school could be a site to empower African Americans and the New Haven African American community and thus effect social change. The interview also covers his time at the Sound School, an alternative school devoted to teaching marine science, marine technology, and sailing. Foote talks about alternative and magnet schools and issues of race and social class, focusing on special challenges for middle-class African American students and parents.</p>

                  <p>Edmund Fusco was a real estate developer who became involved in the Church Street mall project in the early 1960s. Mayor Dick Lee and redevelopment leader Edward Logue initially approached a New York developer named Roger Stevens. Stevens worked on the project for a few years, before selling his interest to Fusco. Fusco discusses the reason for the failure of the project, concluding that a shopping center in an urban area made very little sense in an era of suburbanization and sprawl. Suburbanites, he says, had no interest in coming downtown to shop, and Fusco regrets that he didn't see this at the time. In addition, Fusco discusses the possibilities of a public/private partnership. Can both the city and the developer benefit from a redevelopment project? Must one win out to the disadvantage of the other? Fusco concludes that, in theory, such a partnership can work, but individual personalities make it difficult in practice.</p>

                  <p>Gerde Genece, a Haitian American, lived with her children in the Hill neighborhood of New Haven until 1995 but moved to Fair Haven because of the drug-related crime. Genece and her neighbors organized a neighborhood watch in her new community to fight intimidation and prevent violence. She discusses the time her son was mugged and kidnapped and how it motivated her to stand up to criminals in her neighborhood. Genece explains that her neighbors have all started to watch out for one another and have become involved with the local police station in order to improve their neighborhoods. She also talks about her life as a person of color in New Haven and the prejudices she has experienced.</p>

                  <p>After graduating from Harvard and the Urban Teaching Program at Wesleyan, Jack Gillette took a job teaching history and social studies at Hillhouse High School in New Haven. Gillette discusses his reasons for choosing to work at an underprivileged, almost completely African American, high school, and the challenges he faced in so doing. Gillette arrived in New Haven in 1970, just as the teachers went on strike for the first time. He discusses his decision to join the strike, and reflects on the relationship of the teachers' union to the larger labor movement. He also discusses the obligations of the teacher to his students, and how this affects unionism and labor activism among teachers. After the 1970 strike, the teachers walked out again in 1973, and once more in 1975, before striking a binding bargaining agreement. Gillette left teaching in 1980, but maintains connections with the profession and the teachers' union through his wife, who continued to teach.</p>

                  <p>Karyn Gilvarg arrived in New Haven to attend architecture school in 1975, and is now the Executive Director of City Planning for the city of New Haven. In its early years, she recalls, the City Planning department was basically a "handmaiden" for the Redevelopment Agency, focusing on economic development and urban renewal, rather than city planning as such. Although Gilvarg missed the peak years of redevelopment and urban renewal under the administration of Richard Lee, she reports that redevelopment schemes and extensive plans for downtown New Haven continued well into the 1970s and 1980s. The downtown mall, in particular, dominated the attention of New Haven city planners for much of this period. Gilvarg also discusses the future of New Haven city planning, explaining that providing incentives for biotech companies to move to New Haven and increasing the availability of housing downtown are two directions in which she hopes to move.</p>

                  <p>James Gorang is a teacher at the Dwight Elementary School in downtown New Haven. Gorang arrived at Dwight in 1987, and spent fifteen years as a Special Education teacher before moving into Special Ed administration. Gorang talks about the make-up, curriculum, and pedagogy at Dwight School, which recently converted to a focus on civics and social sciences. Gorang discusses his relationship with his students and their parents, and the relative importance of parental involvement in elementary education. In addition, he speaks to the challenges of teaching towards standardized tests, as required by the recent No Child Left Behind legislation. Gorang talks about the appeal of the Dwight Elementary School, as compared to other New Haven elementary schools, and the opportunitites that the school's location -- near Yale and the cultural offerings of downtown New Haven -- provides for its teachers and students.</p>

                  <p>Charles Grady joined the New Haven police department in 1959, and remained on the force for 32 years. In the late 1960s, he was assigned to the Youth Services Division of the NHPD. Among other activities, Grady worked as a plainclothes detective within New Haven high schools. Grady describes a number of incidents that occurred during his years in the schools, including a threatened take over of Lee High School by a black nationalist organization, which may or may not have been the Black Panthers. Grady commends Mayor Richard Lee for his handling of the 1967 riots, suggesting that the Mayor's willingness to talk with members of the black community, including the Hill Parents' Association, prevented the city from burning. He also suggests that the administration of Yale University played an important role in facilitating discussion and keeping the peace in the city during the late 1960s.</p>

                  <p>Edward Grant was born in New Haven in 1922. During World War II, Grant was stationed in New Orleans, deep in the segregated South. Grant was involved in a few minor acts of civil disobedience in New Orleans, and returned from the war with a determination to overturn racism and segregation in New Haven. Grant pursued this goal on a number of fronts -- working to include black history in school curriculums, involving himself the Civil Rights group CORE (Congress of Racial Equality), and working closely with the Q-House community center in New Haven. Grant discusses his involvement with Democratic party politics in New Haven, including his work to secure the election of Mayor Richard Lee. In retrospect, Grant recognizes the shortcomings of Lee's redevelopment plans, but insists that the blame should be placed on the state of Connecticut, not on Lee. Grant talks about the strained relationship between Yale University and New Haven's African-American community, and discusses his relationships with Yale Presidents Bartlett Giamatti and Kingman Brewster. Grant also describes the 1967 Black Panther Trials and the protests and riots that surrounded them.</p>

                  <p>Rachel Hamenachem runs the Westville Kosher Market. Born in Jerusalem, Hamenachem moved to New Haven in 1985. Her husband opened the Market with a partner, whose retirement forced Rachel Hamenachem into the business. The market caters to a small but faithful clientele, how appreciate the freshness of the market's meat, its ability to meet special orders and special requests, and the personalized service provided by Hamenachem. Hamenachem considers her store to be part of the community in which it's located, and takes pride in knowing the names and stories of her customers. After 20 years in the business, however, Hamenachem fears that small speciality stores may be on their last legs in New Haven. As grocery stores pick up more kosher products, the Westville Kosher Market finds its client base shrinking. In years past, Hamenachem recalls, there were multiple kosher delis, butchers, and bakeries on Whalley Avenue between downtown New Haven and Westville. At the time of the interview, Hamenachem's market is the only kosher speciality shop left.</p>

                  <p>Rhea Hirschman was a leading participant in the women's movement in New Haven in the 1970s and early 1980s. She discusses her initiation into the women's movement through a group called Women vs. Connecticut, which aimed to challenge the state's anti-aborition legislation before Roe vs. Wade. After Roe, Hirschman continued her participation in a variety of women's causes. She worked closely with the Speaker's Bureau, which sent individuals or teams of women to various public sites to lecture on causes related to women's rights, sexuality, or health. Hirschman was involved with the New Haven Women's Center, one of longest operating centers of its kind, and took part in grass roots community education efforts as well as working with domestic violence and rape crisis centers. She also had a radio show and ran a women's book shop for six years. Hirschman also discusses the importance of cultural prodcutions to the dissemination of feminist ideas, mentioning specifically the Theater of Light and Shadow, a political theater group, and the influence of feminist folk, rock, and pop music.</p>

                  <p>Irene Hladkyj moved to New Haven in 1950, joining an already sizable and active Ukrainian community. Hladkyj describes the church as the centerpiece of the Ukrainian community, and remembers that she "always, always" lived near other Ukrainians. The peak years of Ukrainian immigration to the U.S., Hladkyj reports, were between 1947 and 1953. After this point, immigration slackened and the Ukrainian population of New Haven began to decline. Hladkyj raised children, and worked in an number of factories in the area, including the A.C. Gilbert toy factory. Hladkyj describes the founding of a Ukrainian Heritage Center in New Haven in 1984. The center was designed to preserve Ukrainian culture and to show Americans "what it's all about." Hladkyj considers the preservation of Ukrainian heritage a personal mission, and describes a number of benefits over the years designed to raise money for assorted Ukrainian causes, including a concert to benefit the children of Chernobyl.</p>

                  <p>Mary Johnson attended New Haven Teacher's College during the Great Depression. After graduation, she taught in Milford, CT, then in Cheshire, CT, eventually moving to Troupe Middle School in New Haven. Johnson's husband worked at Winchester Repeating Arms factory, where he was very involved in the union, before being hired by his international as an organizer. Early in her tenure at Troupe, Johnson became involved with the New Haven Federation of Teachers, and was a lead negotiator in teachers' strikes in 1968, 1970, 1973, and 1975. Johnson spent several nights in jail during these strikes. Johnson is proud of her union activities, and recognizes the real gains achieved by the striking teachers. She suggests, however, that the radicalism which underlay the 1970s strikes has dissipated, leaving a class of teachers disinterested in their union and unaware of its past.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Edward Joyner arrived in New Haven in 1968 and began teaching sociology and African-American history at Hillhouse high School in 1970. Joyner aligns himself with a crop of activist teachers who arrived in New Haven in the late 60s and early 70s. He talks about the student movement which sought to bring courses in African American history and literature into the Hillhouse curriculum and to hire teachers and counselors more in touch with the African-American experience in New Haven. He describes a great deal of generational tension among teachers at Hillhouse, between those older conservative teachers who opposed change, and younger leftists who supported the student movement. Joyner views the New Haven student movement as a rational, organized, grassroots attempt to create real change in the school system. He also talks about the founding of High School in the Community, and its effect on Hillhouse High School.</p>

                  <p>Laura Keegan recently moved from State College, PA to the Chatham Square Area of North Haven. She shares an apartment with her boyfriend, Walter, who works at Sikorski. Keegan talks about her adopted neighborhood, talking at length about her landlord, Arthur. Upon moving into the neighborhood, Keegan had no expectations, but quickly heard a number of negative stories about Fair Haven from her co-workers. These stories, she says, have proven entirely untrue, and she comments on Fair Haven's bad reputation, suggesting that it's wholly undeserved. She is mostly happy with her neighbors, but has a few suggestions for increasing feelings of community in the Chatham Square area, including the use of internet forums. Keegan compares New Haven to State College, concluding that both are typical college towns. Keegan discusses her artistic ambitions, and her plans to apply to graduate school.</p>

                  <p>Born and raised in New York City, Mark Kinzly is the child of drug addicted parents, and a former alcoholic and drug abuser himself. He came to New Haven in 1984, and spent the next five or six years attempting to get clean. He describes the drug scene in New Haven, and explains why crack cocaine proved so devastating to the African American community. Kinzly discusses the correlation between illness (particularly Hepatitis and HIV) and intravenous drug use, and describes the birth of the needle exchange program in New Haven in 1990. Starting as a grassroots effort, a number of health workers and addiction advocates began the program to offer addicts clean needles in order to curb the spread of infections. In 1991, Kinzly hit rock bottom and managed to get clean. After doing so, he began to volunteer at the New Haven needle exchange program. Kinzly describes his experiences working in the needle exchange van, and lists some of the reasons for the success of the New Haven program, as well as the challenges faced by needle exchange nationwide.</p>

                  <p>After growing up in New Haven and attending Smith College, Elizabeth Kubler returned to New Haven to study at the Yale Art School. Kubler quickly involved herself in the arts scene in New Haven. She began her work with the Women's Auxiliary of the New Haven symphony orchestra, which provided food for the musicians and planned a number of special events. In the 1960s, Kubler was involved in the creation of the Neighborhood Music School and was a key player in the formation of Long Wharf theater, along with founders Jon Jory and Harlan Kleinman. Kubler served on the Board of Long Wharf for decades. Kubler also discusses the development of the Audubon arts district, the creation of the New Haven Arts Council, and the City Spirit Artists grant from the Federal Government, received in 1976, which created an organization to promote public art in the city. She comments on the commitment of a number of New Haven mayoral administrations to the arts since the 1960s, and suggests that New Haven's success in fostering the arts is largely due to the concerted efforts of a small group of citizens constantly pushing the city to further its commitment to art. She includes Mary Hunter Wolf and Charles Newton "Newt" Schenck in this category.</p>

                  <p>Cornelia Leavitt (nee Mitchell) graduated from Hillhouse High School in 1944, one of the top students in her class. Leavitt, an African American, attended Hillhouse High School at a time when only about five per cent of the student body was African American but she asserts that race was never an issue that she paid much attention to. She has very fond memories of Hillhouse, its excellent academics, its inspiring teachers, and her close group of friends. If there was discrimination, Leavitt maintains, she was oblivious to it. Leavitt touches on ethnicity and talks about Jewish and Italian populations at the school. She also alludes to economic issues that affected some students in post-Depression New Haven. She discusses World War II and its impacts on her personally and on the community, remembering that many people she knew were killed or pronounced missing in action. The school, she says, provided a strong community network to keep people together even in times of hardship. After graduating, Leavitt attended Fisk University and the Universities of Wisconsin and Connecticut. She was among the first African American social workers in the state of Connecticut and her sister, Emma Ruff, was the first African American prinicipal of Hillhouse High School.</p>

                  <p>Marie Lloyd, the daughter of German immigrants, was born in New Haven and grew up in the State Street area. She recalls her memories of attending church and school at St. Boniface Church. Lloyd started school at St. Boniface in 1921 and completed eight grades. She mentions that German, Polish, Italian, and Irish individuals all attended St. Boniface. Lloyd also discusses the community that St. Boniface fostered. She attended dances there and was part of the Women's Society. After she married and moved out of the State Street area, she lived too far from the church to engage in its social activities or to send her children to school there. But she continued to attend with her family each Sunday, as did her parents, siblings, and their families. Lloyd then talks about how things in the church changed as its parishioners moved to the suburbs. She and her husband left New Haven in 1955 because they wanted better housing and better schools and believed that New Haven was "getting rough and tough." As more families left, the church began to lose members. At the time of the interview, the Archdiocese at Hartford planned to close St. Boniface because it did not have enough parishioners. Lloyd laments the loss of community that she will feel if the church closes.</p>

                  <p>Matthew Lopes was born in New Haven, attended public schools in the city, graduated from Yale College in 1972, and went on to receive his Masters in Public Health and to complete three years of medical school at Yale. After working in Hartford for several years, Lopes returned to New Haven to run the city's AIDS Division and helped establish the city's Needle Exchange Program. The fist part of the interview describes the culture of Yale College and its professional schools in the 1970s and the increasing ethnic, class, and gender diversity of the schools under President Kingman Brewster. Lopes then talks about starting the New Haven Needle Exchange Program. Despite political opposition from conservatives in Hartford, Lopes, Elaine O'Keefe, Bill Quinn, and the Mayor's Task Force on AIDS succeeded in establishing their pilot program and received $25,000 from the State Legislature to fund it. Lopes talks about the outreach programs that he helped establish in various neighborhoods of New Haven. He also discusses the supportive political culture in New Haven from the Mayor's office and the Chief of Police. Lopes also talks about the New Haven AIDS Services Department more generally, discussing its activities in HIV counseling and testing, AIDS education outreach, and assistance in finding housing for AIDS patients. Finally, he talks about public health as a career path.</p>

                  <p>Curlena McDonald moved into the Dwight Street neighborhood from Newhallville in the late 1980s, just as drugs were beginning to become a large problem in the New Haven African-American community. McDonald speaks about the disappointment within the black community at that time, regarding the lack of substantive change in the years following the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. In the early 1990s, McDonald recalls, black residents of the Dwight area found themselves stuck between an influx of drug dealers and a New Haven police force that many deemed untrustworthy and dangerous. As a result, community members formed the Management Team in an attempt to arrest the spread of drugs and crime. Among other things, the Management Team provided small grants for area youths to undertake projects to clean up and beautify their neighborhoods. When the Management Team found partners in Yale and St. Rafael's Hospital, the organization morphed into the Greater Dwight Development Corporation. Among other ventures, McDonald reports, the Corporation was able to bring a Shaw's Supermarket to the Dwight area, to encourage home ownership, and to open a Montessori school and a business school. McDonald discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages of the movement from a grassroots organization to a better funded, more centralized structure. She surveys what the community activists of the Management Team have been able to accomplish, and what's left to achieve.</p>

                  <p>Linda Maier arrived in New Haven in 1953. Her father had left the South in search of work in 1950, and brought his family to New Haven to join him three years later. Redevelopment forced the family from their home on Canal Street. In 1989, she got involved in community activism, working on neighborhood watches and beautification in the Dwight Street area. She describes a number of community initiatives to combat gangs, drugs, and crime, including a "John of the Week" program, which attempted to discourage prostitution in the Dwight area by publicly embarrassing men purchasing sex, and a garden project and environmental awareness program for children in the neighborhood. Maier was also a leader in the Management Team, which instituted community policing in the Dwight area in the early 1990s, and continues its work today. Maier discusses the efforts of the Management Team and its sister organization, the Greater Dwight Development Corporation, in bringing a supermarket to the Dwight area, opening a Montessori school, and developing an effective home-buyer assistance program. She promises more housing for the elderly and better rental properties in the Dwight area in the future. Maier served briefly as an alderwoman, but reports that the process left her disappointed. Maier also discusses the relationship between Yale and the community.</p>

                  <p>Robert Mailhouse grew up in the East Rock neighborhood of New Haven and attended Hillhouse High School from 1936 until 1940. The interview focuses primarily on his experiences during that period. Mailhouse's father, a Yale graduate and electrical engineer, started the Plymouth Electric Company in New Haven. Mailhouse says that his family was not terribly hard hit by the Great Depression but that they moved in with his grandparents to save money. He talks about Hillhouse High School's wonderful academic reputation, its good teachers, and its success at preparing him for college. He enjoyed many social activities there, particularly athletics, and was a member of one of the high school fraternities. Prompted by the interviewer, Mailhouse spends a good deal of time discussing the African American students at the school. He recalls that African American students made up only a small percentage of the class. He did not perceive much overt racism towards them but remembers that African American and white students did not generally socialize that much. He believes that this was voluntary on both parts and that students did not give it much thought. After graduating from Hillhouse, Mailhouse attended Colorado College. He talks about his time there and compares high school with college.</p>

                  <p>Dominick Maldonado was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in Fair Haven. After graduating from Wilbur Cross High School, he joined the Air Force then returned to New Haven and worked with substance abusers at Crossroads, Inc., a residential treatment facility. In the 1980s, he began work in HIV/AIDS outreach, education, and prevention. Maldonado recalls growing up as a Puerto Rican in New Haven and the discrimination he faced. Most of the interview focuses on his work in HIV/AIDS in the Latino community and with the Needle Exchange Program. In the early 1980s, Maldonado states, there was little HIV/AIDS information available except for members of the homosexual Anglo community. Maldonado created Hispanos Unidos to reach out to the Latino community and to confront its cultural taboos about HIV/AIDS. He was also one of the first three members of a community outreach team that worked with addicts in the New Haven community to educate them about HIV and intravenous drug use. In 1987, Maldonado, Sher Horosko, and Elaine O'Keefe, came up with the idea of a Needle Exchange Program as a way to move beyond education. In 1990, they received a $25,000 grant from the Connecticut State Legislature to start a pilot program in New Haven. Yale Researchers Edward Kaplan and Bob Heimer secured $250,000 in services from Yale and a van from the university for the program. Maldonado remarks that this assistance and the support of Police Chief Nicholas Pastore helped make the Needle Exchange Program a national model.</p>

                  <p>Christine Melnyk immigrated to New Haven with her family in 1949 and joined the city's sizeable Ukranian American population. Melnyk discusses the Ukranian American community and her involvement with it as a child and an adult. Her family arrived as part of a second wave of Ukranian immigrants fleeing Russian political control, an influx that peaked during the 1950s. Melynk's family lived near the Ukranian Church that was on Park Street and spent much time there. She also joined Platzt, a Ukranian society, went to Ukranian school three times a week, and joined the Ukranian National Women's League of America after college. Her family spoke Ukranian in the home, and Melnyk's own daughters learnd Ukranian before English. She talks about her identification with two cultures, American and Ukranian. She also discusses her efforts to preserve and promote Ukranian culture as an adult, through activities in various societies, annual community celebrations, and through outreach at the Ethnic Heritage Center at Southern Connectitcut State University. She worries that the newer Ukranian immigrants have less interest in their cultural heritage than did the members of her generation and discusses her fear that the community has become somewhat stagnant.</p>

                  <p>Karen Mielcarz first started visiting downtown New Haven in the late 1970s while she was a student at the Paier School of Art in Hamden. Since that time she rented housing in the Newhallville neighborhood, on Chapel Street, and in Hamden and then bought a home in Fair Haven in the early 2000s. She recalls how much she enjoyed being a young person in New Haven in the late 1970s and early 1980s and talks about going to shows at Toad's Place, the Agora Theater, the Grotto, and at the Coliseum and about patronizing small businesses and restaurants like Blessings, Group W Bench, and Dava. She also remembers working at print shops on State Street. In the early 1990s she married but divorced several years later. When she remarried in 2001, she and her husband bought a home in Fair Haven because it was beautiful and affordable and they were tired of being tenants. However, she explains that crime and high costs have made being a landlord more difficult than she realized it would be. Mielcarz misses some of the things that she believed made New Haven unique in the 1970s and 1980s. Though she enjoys the arts culture and restaurants of present-day New Haven, she feels that it is unaffordable. She also laments that crime has made her neighborhood a difficult place to live.</p>

                  <p>Mary Miller was the Festival Director of the International Festival of Arts and Ideas from 2001 until 2005. Miller spent her childhood in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she began playing the violin at the age of three. As an adult, she had a career in the orchestra before becoming a music critic. Later she became the festival director for the United Kingdom's festival of Nordic Culture and organized community outreach programs for the English National Opera. In 2001, she received an invitation to take over New Haven's International Festival of Arts and Ideas. Miller admits that she had not planned to move to the United States, but was intrigued by New Haven's international population and its interest in culture and arts. Miller spends much of the interview discussing her philosophical approach to the Festival. She sees it, and art more generally, as a means to encourage social cohesion and bring different parts of the New Haven community together. Ethnic, national, and cultural differences can be bridged through the arts, Miller suggests. She also discusses attempts to involve children in the arts. Later, she discusses funding difficulties and the Festival's attempts to collaborate with other local organizations, including Yale University, the Dixwell neighborhood's gospel festival, and the Long Wharf, Shubert, and Yale Reperatory Theaters.</p>

                  <p>Kovilka Milvojevic and her daughter, Verica, fled Bosnia in 1992 and spent several years in Germany before coming to New Haven in 2000 through the help of the Interfaith Ministry Refuge. The two women discuss their experiences as refugees and the home that they purchased in the Chatham Square area of Fair Haven. The two Milvojevics remember coming to the United States with only two suitcases each and discuss their first few years in New Haven. They lived in a Westville apartment initially but Verica moved to attend Albertus Magnus University several months after they arrived. Kovilka talks about her language difficulties but says that the Interfaith Ministry Refuge and her employer, Yale University, helped her become established in Connecticut. The two discuss the differences that they perceive between the United States and Bosnia. They appreciate the freedom of religion and speech but believe that many Americans are unaware of international events and drive their cars too much. With a grant for low-income families and assistance from the Yale Homebuyer Program, Kovilka bought a home in Chatham Square. The two talk about how much they enjoy the neighborhood and their efforts to improve it through block watch programs and other community uplift programs.</p>

                  <p>After graduating from Yale College in 1987 and Yale Divinity School in 1993, Michael Morand began his career working for the Yale University Office of New Haven and State Affairs. Morand describes the work of this Office in encouraging New Haven's economic development. This office was established in 1995, two years after Richard Levin became president, as a way to connect Yale to the community and to look for ways to make the city attractive to investors and businesses. He discusses community development and public relations initiatives such as the Yale Homebuyer Program, the Yale Entrepreneurial Society, and Market New Haven. He also recounts efforts to increase flights to Tweed-New Haven Airport and to encourage biotechnology and venture capital initiatives in the city. Morand spends much of the interview touting the benefits of New Haven, to both residents and businesses, and comparing it to other towns. He also contrasts New Haven's current development plan of "strategic incrementalism" to the larger-scale urban renewal and Model City efforts of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

                  <p>Daniel Naddis moved to Connecticut for work in 1982 and chose to live in New Haven because of its Jewish community resources, including a synagogue, Jewish school, and the availability of Kosher provisions. Most of his interview talks about the changing availability of Kosher food and its effects on the community. Naddis emphasizes that patronizing local businesses, such as bakers and butchers, is a way to nurture community and communal institutions. Yet cost, convenience, quality, and increasing strictness of Kosher standards have made it difficult for small businesses to compete with larger supermarkets, especially Stop and Shop. Naddis is involved with the Kosher Advocacy Group, which urges unity among the Jewish community by trying to reach consensus on Kosher regulations. In addition to Kosher food, Naddis talks about day schools and other educational opportunities for New Haven Jews. He also compares New Haven's Jewish community with London, England, where he used to live.</p>

                  <p>Lola Nash set up the first Head Start Program in the United States in the Elm Haven neighborhood of New Haven. She was also one of the founders of the Edith B. Jackson family daycare center in New Haven and, in the 1980s, established a daycare at Yale New Haven Hospital to provide child care to nurses and other female employees. Before coming to New Haven, Nash cultivated a background in early childhood education by working in many diverse programs. She graduated from college in 1945 then worked for government-sponsored day care centers in New York City, a wartime program to allow mothers to labor in factories and other industries. She then traveled to Burma with her husband and home-schooled their children while teaching music to local children. After returning to the United States, she taught at public schools serving low-income communities in New York. She and her husband moved to New Haven in the 1960s because he was hired to set up alternative school programs. Nash was then asked to establish the Head Start program, which was funded as a pilot program and further supported by Ed Ziegler and the Yale Child Studies Center. She talks about her experiences there, her teaching philosophies, and Head Start's commitment to physical and emotional needs of children and their parents.</p>

                  <p>The son of Italian immigrants, Frank Nasti, Jr. grew up in Fair Haven and became involved in redevelopment projects there in the late 1960s. In 1968, Nasti became president of the Fair Haven Project Area Committee, a group of local residents who made recommendations to the New Haven Redevelopment Agency about urban renewal initiatives. Nasti and other members of the Committee lobbied to change New Haven's demolition plans and instead pushed for the construction of single- and two-family homes. He helped raise money for their construction and secured building permits. As President of the Corporation for Urban Home Ownership, a non-profit development corporation, Nasti worked to construct of affordable urban housing for purchase and rental throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the interview focuses on his experiences in these endeavors. Nasti criticizes Richard Lee's urban renewal efforts for being out of touch with local needs and desires. He also talks about the demographic shift in Fair Haven from Italian and Irish to Latino populations and the decline of industrial and manufacturing jobs.</p>

                  <p>Craig O'Connell was a teacher in several New Haven elementary schools and the founder of Teachers for a Progressive Union. Born in New Haven in 1947, O'Connell grew up in a working-class family in Newhallville. He attended Catholic School, graduated from Fairfield University, and became a fourth grade teacher in Newhallville in 1969. In the 1970s, he worked for the Martin Luther King School, a charter program that tried to foster community involvement in the schools. Most of O'Connell's interview covers his experience in the teacher's union. He first went on strike in 1970 and recalls that few other elementary school teachers joined him on the picket line. After the thirteen-day strike, however, O'Connell began to organize fellow teachers at his school. He also formed the group Teachers for a Progressive Union, a radical organization that addressed issues of racism, civil rights, gender inequities, class size, and working conditions. This group, O'Connell notes, was at odds with other union leaders and the Board of Education, which focused on traditional issues such as salaries and benefits. O'Connell also talks about the teachers strikes in 1973 and 1975, how hard-line stances from the Board of Education helped nurture public support for teachers, and how the culture of teaching has changed since the 1970s.</p>

                  <p>Born in Birmingham in 1935, Curtis Patton began to fight for civil rights from an early age, a commitment he carried with him to Yale in the 1970s. In high school, Patton joined the youth division of the NAACP. He remembers hearing a 1951 speech by Mordecai Johnson, the president of Howard University, which predicted the coming Civil Rights movement. After graduating high school, Patton attended Fisk University which he describes as a center of civil rights activism. At Fisk, Patton's professors encouraged disobedience as a way to protest segregation. He recounts occasions when he broke racial barriers in movie theaters and on trains. He also remembers the two times he encountered Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1955 Montgomery and at Fisk the following year. Patton attended the University of Michigan during the 1960s and discusses watching events unfold in Alabama from afar. In 1970, he became an assistant professor at Yale. A large portion of the interview focuses on Patton's hero, Edward Bouchet, an African American servant to a white Yale student who earned a Ph.D. in physics from Yale in the 1870s. Patton concludes with a discussion of the Black Power Movement and how it differed from the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

                  <p>Herb Pearce grew up in New Haven, graduated from Commercial (later Wilbur Cross) High School in 1935, and went to work for the A. C. Gilbert Company in Fair Haven for the next twenty-one years. Pearce knew the Gilbert family because he delivered newspapers to their home and it was this personal relationship that helped him secure a full-time job during the Great Depression. Pearce discusses the various jobs that he performed at the toy factory. He began building models for department store displays, then became an inspector, a manager, and, after World War II, represented the company's sales department in Ohio and Michigan. He remembers A. C. Gilbert as a family-oriented man who paid attention to workers' grievances and interests. These traits, Pearce believed, kept workers happy and prevented unions from getting a foothold in the factory. Pearce also touches on the factory's shift to wartime production from 1941 to 1945, the large number of female workers in the factory, and what the average work day looked like. The interview concludes with a discussion of his decision to leave the factory in 1957 to start his own business, A. C. Gilbert's death in 1961, and the sale of the company the following year.</p>

                  <p>Ray Piascik works for the U.S. Postal Service. He has lived in New Haven his whole life, and currently works for the Yale branch of the USPS on Elm Street. He is a life-long fan of the rock band the Doors. Piascik says that he attended roughly ten doors concerts during the band's existence. In this interview, Piascik describes the events at a Doors concert in New Haven, during which Jim Morrison -- the Doors' lead singer -- was arrested. The arrest sparked a small riot in the arena. Piascik also describes his other musical interests, and meeting the Rolling Stones at the airport.</p>

                  <p>In 1970, recently separated and the mother of four small children, Patricia Pierce chose to attend the May Day demonstrations on the New Haven Green. The event marked a turning point in her political activism and awareness. Pierce grew up in an upper-middle class family and attended Vassar. She came to New Haven in 1964 because her then husband, attorney Cheever Tyler, got a job at the Wiggin and Dana law firm. Although the couple had separated by the spring of 1970, Tyler instructed Pierce to take their four children to Branford to avoid potential violence on May 1. She left her children with a friend and came back to New Haven to observe the activity for an hour or so. Pierce reflects on the events of the day and the political consciousness that she began to develop in their aftermath. She talks about becoming an activist in the 1970s, the women's movement, her decision to get a Ph.D., and her later community involvement with Planned Parenthood and the Amistad Academy charter school. Pierce, the Dean of the Yale School of Management at the time of the interview, also discusses the political apathy that she perceives among undergraduates today.</p>

                  <p>Lawrence Pisani graduated from Yale College in 1942 and received his Ph.D. in 1951. He talks about his father, an Italian immigrant who covered Connecticut for New York City's Italian daily newspaper and published his own weekly paper for the New Haven Italian community. Pisani discusses the role of these and other local Italian papers in nurturing Italian community. The papers offered information to help immigrants assimilate and become naturalized U.S. citizens. Yet at the same time they served as tools to preserve pride in Italian regional and national heritage and to keep readers abreast of social and cultural events in the Italian communities around New Haven. Pisani discusses the way that members of the Italian community and newspapers reacted to Mussolini. While he believes that most denounced him after he allied with Hitler, he notes that in the 1920s many Italians (and Americans) believed Mussolini might bring progress to Italy. Although he touches on Mussolini and fascism here, Pisani says that the main focus of the newspapers was in social and cultural cohesion rather than political reporting.</p>

                  <p>Carl Pullen grew up in Bridgeport but moved to New Haven after graduating high school to work for the police department. He talks about his experiences as an African American police officer in the city during the Civil Rights movement. Pullen and other minority police officers faced discrimination in the police force. Pullen claims that the examinations for promotion were biased and that minority officers received the worst assignments in the roughest areas of the city, such as his assignment to Dixwell Avenue. In the 1970s, Pullen became involved with the Silver Shield organization, a society within the Police Department that became a force for civil rights and anti-discrimination. Pullen and several other officers filed and won a lawsuit that alleged discrimination. Afterwards, New Haven appointed its first African American Chief of Police and dismantled barriers to promotion for African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and women. Pullen also recounts his experiences with the May Day Strikes and the Black Panthers. After retiring, Pullen earned a Master's degree in History, worked for the Hamden School System, and then joined Yale University's security department. He briefly recounts his experiences at Yale and with students there.</p>

                  <p>Carl Pullen joined the New Haven Police Department in 1962 after serving in the Marine Corps and worked as a patrolman and detective for thirteen years. This interview focuses on his experiences on the police force in the 1960s. Pullen remembers the era as a period of great social unrest. He recalls working in the Hill section as a plainclothes officer during the May Day Demonstrations. He tells the story of arresting Doors' lead singer Jim Morrison at a 1967 concert. Although the media and many fans claimed that the police mistreated Morrison, Pullen discounts their allegations. He also talks about the protests of the 1960s. Pullen admits that he agreed with the sentiments of some protesters but not necessarily their radicalism. He also felt the professional imperative to remain a neutral party. Pullen talks further about his experience as an African American police officer, the discrimination that he and other minorities faced, and the successful lawsuit that he and other officers filed that won better assignments, promotions, and fairer hiring for women and ethnic minorities.</p>

                  <p>Douglas Rae is a Professor of Political Science at Yale University. He talks about his involvement with the mayoral candidacy of John Daniels. After Daniels' victory, Rae became his Chief Administrator. The central political strategy going into the election, and the central initiative coming out, was a program of community policing to help lower crime in New Haven without "equipping white cops with nightsticks to beat up on black people." Rae describes the trouble with the New Haven police department in attempting to institute a community policing program, and the steps taken by Mayor Daniels to restructure the NHPD after his election. The Daniels administration attempted to attract more women and minorities, and, in an effort to increase trust between the community and the police force, the mayor recruited officers born and raised in the inner-city neighborhoods in which they worked. The key to effective policing, Rae suggests, is an engaged populace and a police force that approaches the community with civility, rather than treating it as a adversary to be conquered.

                  <p>Tom Ragozzino was a history teacher and principal in the New Haven public school system from 1963 until he retried in 1998. His interview focuses on racial tensions at Lee High School, where he was a history teacher, on race riots at Lee and other area high schools, and on the effects of the riots on the school system in the 1970s. Ragozzino discusses the December 1967 race riot at Hillhouse High School, the February 1967 eruption at Lee High School, and several other racially motivated disturbances at other schools. He suggests that the climate of the late 1960s, defined by national race riots, the Civil Rights Movement, drugs, violence, and changing demographics within the schools, infiltrated New Haven's school populations and that administrators. Ragozzino believes the older generation of teachers and guidance counselors had no idea how to react to growing racial issues. He also blames outside agitation for increasing tensions in the schools and the media for overblowing minor events. He then criticizes the 1970s curricular and institutional reforms that occurred in response to the riots, which he believes led to a decline in standards that ultimately hurt students more than it helped them. Ragozzino also touches on issues of white flight, changes in the racial makeup of students, teachers, and the administration, and high turnover in the school system. He also criticizes the charges that many teachers were racist and blames vocal minorities for making such accusations.</p>

                  <p>Rafael Ramos is the producer for the Bregamos Theater in Fair Haven. Bregamos is a community theater whose mission is to bridge cultures, encourage intergenerational projects, and introduce Fair Haven residents to all aspects of the theater. Bregamos, Ramos explains, roughly translates to "We'll work it out." The theater aims to build community through collaboration and to make theater accessible to individuals who have had little experience with it. The theater offers after-school workshops to introduce young people to acting and production. It encourages alternative theater, such as hip hop musicals. Ramos also discusses the theater's relationship to the larger arts community in New Haven.</p>

                  <p>James Richardson grew up in Brooklyn, New York and later moved to New Haven, where he is now a priest, local activist, and community organizer. Richardson describes his growing interest in the church, starting from his membership in religious communities in Belgium and France and, later, Canada, Baltimore, and Chicago. He describes his membership as ethnically and economically diverse, talking about the staff's broad-based efforts to appeal to the entire congregation. He discusses the challenges of creating a sense of religious community amidst cultural and economic differences. He also talks about the church as a site of cross-cultural worship and communication, despite these differences. He describes the importance of church members uniting to help each other and to help other local churches and community service organizations interested in helping people improve their housing situations. He details his church's recent public service projects in education, employment, housing, health care, community service, and mentorship, all to encourage a sense of community in New Haven neighborhoods.</p>

                  <p>Yakeita Robinson was born in Bridgeport, CT, and moved to New Haven after 8th grade. In 2001, during her sophomore year at Hillhouse High School, a LEAP (Leadership, Education, and Athletics in Partnership) recruiter visited her school, prompting Robinson to apply for a job as a counselor. She has worked with LEAP since that time, rising to the rank of Site Coordinator. Robinson has been stationed in the Church Street South area since she began. Robinson discusses her work with the Church Street South community and her administrative responsibilities at LEAP, as well as the ethnic, racial, and geographic make-up of children in the program. Robinson stresses that LEAP's primary importance is providing participants with opportunities otherwise unavailable in their communities, including computer classes, karate and dance classes, public speaking courses, and swimming pool access. Along with her work with LEAP, Robinson has a degree in cosmetology and hopes to own a business some day.</p>

                  <p>David Rosen, who grew up in New York City, describes his experiences practicing law in 1969 at New Haven Legal Assistance, a legal aid office. He shares anecdotes about his interest in civil rights cases. He describes the difficulty of ensuring a fair trial amidst historical judicial racism against black defendants. He discusses his role as a legal assistant on behalf of Black Panther Bobby Seale in the internationally known 1970 dual indictment of Seale and Panther Ericka Huggins for the 1969 murder of fellow Panther Alex Rackley, who was suspected of being an FBI informant. Rosen describes how the mounting local, national, and international racial tensions surrounding the case intensified and complicated legal efforts to withhold confidential trial details from the public. Rosen specifically mentions evidence collection and jury selection as two areas in which he and other Civil Rights lawyers focused. He describes these areas as influencing the pursuit of justice, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the black defendants. He shares what he believes were the case's strengths and weaknesses and evaluates the roles of the counsel, judiciary, and public in both the case's proceedings and the defendants' eventual acquittal. He mentions several key individuals, including distinguished law professor Tom Emerson, Charles Garry, who was Seale's defense lawyer, Katie Rohrback, who was Huggins's defense lawyer, plaintiff and key state witness George Sams, and then-Yale President Kingman Brewster.</p>

                  <p>Helene Rosenberg came to New Haven after World War II. She discusses her experiences as a Polish survivor of the Holocaust and her involvement in New Haven's Holocaust memorial projects. Rosenberg recalls several personal stories about being a Jew in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II, her brushes with the Gestapo, and her eventual capture. A nurse, Rosenberg was forced to work in German hospitals during the war. She also discusses her struggles as an immigrant in New Haven who spoke little English and her efforts to raise her children in the Jewish community. In the 1970s, her husband, the President of the Jewish Federation of New Haven, was one of the driving forces behind the Edgewood Park Holocaust Memorial that was constructed in 1977. Rosenberg recalls his efforts and those of Mayor Frank Logue to create the first Holocaust memorial in the United States. She also talks about the Holocaust survivor film project and the efforts to create a video archive of survivors' stories.</p>

                  <p>Constance Royster was born in New Haven, but moved to Bethany, CT while she was in ninth grade. After spending a year at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, Royster transferred to Yale as part of Yale College's first co-ed class. She discusses her experiences at Yale and the difficulties of being a "pioneer." Royster discusses her impressions of the Bobby Seale/Erika Huggins Black Panther trials in 1970, focusing specifically on the manner in which the experience bonded together formerly disparate segments of the Yale and New Haven communities. Erika Huggins, coincidentally, is a distant cousin of Royster's. She also speaks to the nature of racial and gender relations on Yale's campus in the early 1970s. After graduation from Yale, Royster attended law school and became an attorney in New York City. Royster discusses changes she's seen in the New Haven area since her childhood years, including the destruction of important residential and community centers such as the Elm Haven projects. She sees, however, positive changes on the horizion, epitomized by the increasing cleanliness, safety, and vitality of New Haven's downtown.</p>

                  <p>Eunice Baker, born in New Haven, recalls the multicultural area of her neighborhood since 1920, sharing anecdotes of her family members and neighborhood friends. She mentions her parents' decision to come to America from the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts and Nevis, following the earlier immigration of her extended family members. She describes the ties and expansion of her U.S. extended family network as they all settled in the New Haven area. She shares anecdotes of playing with her childhood neighbors, many of whose families spoke no English. She discusses her later interest and involvement in social work, starting as an adolescent. She talks about family, friends, education, and church in her community, values that she believes created the sense of a common immigrant experience among culturally and economically diverse individuals and families. She discusses the effect of conflict on her family and community, particularly war and economic instability. She fondly recalls the recreation, music, and media that were popular during her childhood and adult life. She uses examples from her own life and those of various Civil Rights leaders to stress the importance of youth education then and today.</p>

                  <p>David Saenz moved to the Chatham Street neighborhood in Fair Haven five years ago. He discusses some anecdotes from his earlier life, including his rescue of two stray cats. Saenz is mostly content with his neighborhood, but describes a running feud with a neighbor who raises fighting pit bulls next door. The pit bulls, Saenz says, have attacked a number of people and killed one of his cats, but the police refuse to take action. Saenz has harsh words for the police in his neighborhood, suggesting that they're overworked and ineffectual. On a number of ocassions, Saenz says, he has called the police to report a crime and failed to recieve any response at all. He also discusses the plight of illegal immigrants in his neighborhood, who have been the victims of a number of crimes but are too scared by their immigration status to report crimes to the police. Saenz also describes a neighborhood street festival he recently attended.</p>

                  <p>Michael Santarcangelo describes his employment with Yale University since 1963. He focuses on his membership in the Yale University Union, in which his father also participated during the 1950s. He describes his interest in union organizing that started from being exposed to his parents' experiences in the union. After joining the union, he was eventually promoted to leadership positions and created strong business and personal relationships with fellow union members and leaders, such as John Wilhelm and Vinny Sirabella. He talks about why he believes that unions enhance the philosophy and practice of employer-employee relationships, sharing examples illustrating union measures in three stages: mobilization, demonstration, and negotiation. Specifically, these are: identifying the working conditions or contract terms believed to be a problem in need of change; communicating with other area and state union members to research the working conditions and contract terms of their employers; uniting members with a common interest in changing the issue and a common vision of the way in which it may be improved; forming a platform of the conditions or terms to be changed reflecting its members' concerns; creating organizing tactics against resistant labor administrators and other non-union affiliating employees; and, finally, presenting their grievances to labor authorities to negotiate and, in certain cases, change, the employees' working conditions or contract terms. Santarcangelo stresses the importance of mutual respect and tolerance in the employer-employee and labor authority-union relationships and in the general working environment.</p>

                  <p>Joel Schiavone, born in New York, is a New Haven developer. He discusses his efforts to develop downtown New Haven since the 1970s. He talks about the challenges of integrating multiple areas and ideas in a development project, encompassing architecture, finances, business, and psychology. He describes why and how he got involved in developing downtown New Haven. He mentions urban renewal in the 1950s and 60s as a motivation, which, he describes, weakened downtown New Haven districts and neighborhoods. He talks about why he believes downtown areas are important to urban growth and reputation. He describes the renovation and expansion of New Haven downtown districts and neighborhoods in the context of Yale University and gives his opinion of their interplay over the years. He lists past projects to revitalize New Haven and analyzes his perceptions of their strengths and weaknesses, specifically mentioning Chapel Street's development. He compares New Haven's downtown development to that of other urban cities and college towns, such as New York City, Boston, Oxford, and Austin. He shares his vision for downtown New Haven's future, defined, he says, in for-profit sectors and the integration of downtown sites and residential neighborhoods.</p>

                  <p>Joel Schivaone, born in New York, is a New Haven developer. He describes his work on various downtown projects since the 1970s and his impressions of what makes downtown areas functional, safe, and exciting. He talks about the change he's noticed over the years in New Haven's downtown arts and shopping districts, comparing them to those in other urban cities. In particular, he describes the architectural visions, strengths, and problems of the construction, maintenance, and marketing of the New Haven Coliseum. He discusses New Haven's developing downtown districts, such as Long Wharf, the Arts District, Chapel Street and Dwight Street. He weighs the roles of for-profit and non-profit corporations and activities on urban development, describing his take on the importance of a strong financial relationship between facilities and their corporate sponsors. He discusses the role of a Coliseum arena in the development of a downtown district. He compares New Haven's now-demolished Coliseum with those in both small urban cities, such as Hartford, and larger metropolises, such as New York City and San Francisco. He discusses past and present projects to revitalize New Haven neighborhoods and districts and gives his interpretation of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

                  <p>Sheila Shanklin recalls the beginnings of the Dwight area Management Team. The Management team is a grassroots organization devoted to community policing, home-buyer assistance, and beautification in the Dwight Street area of New Haven. Shanklin describes the first meetings of the organization in a storefront on the corner of Day and Chapel Streets. She also describes the yearly festival organized by the Management Team. After a number of years of successful Management Team activity, the members formed a sister organization, the Greater Dwight Development Corporation. The centralization allowed for easier access to funds and political power without blunting the grassroots, community-centered nature of the organization. Shanklin explains the membership structures of the Management Team, and describes its relationships with Yale and St. Rafael's hospital. She also touches on the slight resentment that some Dwight residents seem to feel about the activities and leadership of the Management Team.</p>

                  <p>Barbara Sharnick describes her childhood interactions with her mother and grandparents, drawing upon the role of her congressionalist faith on her childhood and concept of family. She speaks from a New Haven nursing home. She illustrates a typical day there, in which she often has most of the day free to reflect, write short stories, and spend time with other residents. She shares anecdotes about marriage and sacrifice, family and obligations, and her relationships with other residents. She talks about aspects of the nursing home that enhance and detract from her vision of a home. She compares her relaxed, reflective time as a nursing home resident with her active experiences as a young woman studying journalism, working in government and advertising, traveling around the country and parts of Europe, and raising a family with her late husband, John. She describes shifts she's noticed throughout her lifetime in social relations, including interactions between the young and old and those between children and their parents. She draws upon her past and current experiences and those of others in her reflections. She talks about her visions of an ideal nursing home, a group home of several elderly residents with home medical care and an active living arrangement in which they could help each other by paying bills and cooking together, among other things.</p>

                  <p>Robert Silverman's family moved to New Haven in the mid-1930s and to the Legion Avenue neighborhood in 1939, where they became a part of the local Jewish community. He grew up and lived there until 1954, when Richard Lee's redevelopment projects forced residents and businesses out. Silverman talks about the many small businesses that he patronized in the neighborhood, including local grocery stores and various bakeries including Lenders' bagels. Although the area was largely Jewish, he talks about the ethnic diversity there and the lack of significant tension. He also discusses the nearby Oak Street area, which he characterizes as composed largely of African American families and poorer Italian and Jewish families. Silverman then discusses the redevelopment projects of the 1950s under Mayor Richard Lee and New Haven's designation as a Model City by the federal government. While everyone in his neighborhood was initially excited at the renewal proposals and the money they promised to bring in, they soon turned against the project when they realized the extent of the demolition plans. As homeowners and businesses were displaced, Silverman remembers, they lodged complaints against the Lee administration but to no avail. He laments the tragic loss of community and the local business establishments as a great tragedy of the redevelopment schemes.</p>

                  <p>Sam Slie was born in 1925 and grew up in the Oak Street neighborhood of New Haven. He discusses his experiences as an African American in New Haven during the Great Depression and in the southern United States during World War II. Slie describes the Oak Street neighborhood as very ethnically diverse. He had Jewish and African American friends and talks about the variety of small businesses that Jews and African Americans owned. He did not personally feel much racial tension growing up. Slie talks about the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. He then talks about the high school tracking system in New Haven, in which academically motivated students attended Hillhouse High School while others attended Commercial High School or Boardman Trade School for training in manual labor careers. Slie attended Hillhouse High School and admits that he was intelligent but somewhat unmotivated as a student. His first real wakeup call to institutionalized racial discrimination occurred when a Marine recruiter came to Hillhouse during his senior year and informed him that he was ineligible to join the Marines because he was African American. After graduating, Slie was drafted and set to Fort Benning Georgia for training. As the only African American soldier in his regiment, Slie faced significant discrimination and the reality of Jim Crow segregation when he arrived in the South. He recounts his experiences with the color line in North Carolina and Georgia and his growing awareness of racial prejudice during his early adulthood.</p>

                  <p>Mercedes Soto, who grew up in Gary, Indiana, describes her involvement in LEAP since 1995. LEAP, Leadership, Education, and Athletics in Partnership, is a New Haven youth mentoring program that began 1992. She discusses her experiences working with displaced and unmotivated New Haven youth in both after-school and summer programs. She describes the visions, challenges, and rewards of interacting with and empowering young people. She talks about the skills she believes LEAP creates and enhances in New Haven youth, including those in leadership development and tolerance. She explains why she believes the experiential learning encouraged by LEAP is fundamental not only to an academic curriculum, but also to the development of the self. She talks about the relationship of LEAP and school systems, detailing the problems the organization has faced over the years. She describes the spread of LEAP into other surrounding cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport. She talks about the challenges and rewards of continuing and expanding upon the strengths of the New Haven chapter. She shares anecdotes of people, events, and situations that she believes illustrate LEAP's role in enhancing relationships among and within youth, their families, teachers, administrators, and the community.</p>

                  <p>Peter Spodick was born in New Haven, and attended Yale College and Yale Law School. He grew up in Woodbridge, but spent a great deal of time in New Haven as child. He describes his childhood as an age of innocence. Although he was part of small Jewish minority in Woodbridge, Spodick felt no discomfort on this count. He remembers walking the streets of downtown New Haven at night, with no sense of fear. But now, Spodick suggests, things have changed. Spodick describes the changing role of Yale in the New Haven community, the shifting landscape of downtown New Haven, and the failure of personal relationships in the city. Spodick's father worked in New York City movie theaters during the silent film era, so Spodick's move to the film industry came as little surprise. Spodick discusses his career in the movie theater business, including run-ins with the Walk Disney Company and with Steven Spielberg. Spodick also discusses the old Lincoln Theater in New Haven, which specialized in foreign and artistic films, and recalls the days when New Haven had a number of small movie theaters. York Square Cinema, which closed in 2005, was the last of its kind.</p>

                  <p>Nancy Stitzer, a white student, was part of the first generation of students who were bussed to Bassett Junior High School. She also Hillhouse High School during the 1967 race riot there. Stitzer remembers the bussing and integration experience very negatively and believes that it hurt the cohesion of her school class. She explains that many students went to private schools if their parents could afford it, while those who could not faced bussing and redistricting that broke up their classes and friendships. Because of bussing, Stitzer explained, she could not participate in afterschool activities at Bassett. She considers those who made it through the bussing years to be "survivors." Stitzer also talks about the 1967 race riot at Hillhouse High School and remembers being very frightened of the violence. She is surprised to learn that the riot started internally, for she remembers Black Panthers starting the riot. She is also surprised to learn about the police presence after the riot, brought on at the behest of many of the older teachers at the school.</p>

                  <p>Samuel Teitelman, a first-generation Russian immigrant, was born in Cuba and came to New Haven with his parents in the 1920s after living shortly in New York City. He describes living in the Oak Street-Legion Avenue neighborhoodand recalls visiting the small businesses owned by people from a variety of backgrounds, including Jewish, Italian, and Polish. He discusses the familiarity among neighbors from a variety of countries and cultures, the different degrees of their assimilation to the American language and culture, and their varied connections to their immigrant homelands. He talks about the growth of ethnic enclaves as immigrants moved to different New Haven neighborhoods with the new settlement of other minority and immigrant groups. As a child, he spoke Yiddish at home, but he says that outside of the home, he mainly spoke English, both with his Jewish and non-Jewish peers. He talks about the centrality of the Jewish culture in his upbringing. He describes his childhood as predominately spent going to his synagogue's services and activities, which he describes as a social and educational outlet for his family. A soldier in WWII, he describes his later adjustment to civilian life, sharing changes he noticed in his childhood neighborhood's population and establishments. Now active at his childhood synagogue, he discusses his visions for its future, weighing the costs and benefits of preserving and renovating its facilities.</p>

                  <p>Virginia Tenzer was born in Watertown, CT, the 11th of 12 children of Italian immigrant parents. After graduating UConn, she married a Yale graduate student, and moved to New Haven in the early 1950s. Tenzer's husband's work moved them around a lot, but the couple returned to New Haven upon his retirement in 1994, buying a co-op in the University Towers. Tenzer describes the peculiar co-operative structure of her building, which led to a protacted legal battle with a group of developers in the late 1990s. These legal issues depleted much of the cooperative's money, forcing the Towers to declare bankruptcy. Tenzer talks about her neighbors, the building's management, and social life in the building.</p>

                  <p>Murray Trachten, born in Arizona, moved to New Haven as a young child. He describes his multicultural Greenwood Street neighborhood in a devout Jewish household among extended Russian family members. He describes his neighborhood as lower middle-class and his neighbors as ethnically diverse, including people of Jewish, Italian, and African-American descent. He says that his family's social life centered on the local Hebrew school, The New Haven Hebrew School, and their local synagogue, Orchard Street Synagogue. He shares examples of times he was aware of and sometimes uncomfortable with his difference as a Jewish student in his encounters with non-Jewish students. He remembers having mixed feelings about this difference. He says that he enjoyed the sense of security of being with his family but did not enjoy not being able to interact with other children, especially on Sabbath days. He talks about learning English in school while remaining fluent in Yiddish and his family's stress on education. He describes how his notion of cultural difference changed during his college years at NYU and later years in law school, where he was exposed to cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity. He talks about the role of his Jewish faith and upbringing in how he has raised his family. He discusses changes he has noticed in his childhood neighborhood, particularly after effect of 1950s and 60s urban renewal policies on Jewish businesses.</p>

                  <p>Adeline Tucker was born and raised in the Dixwell neighborhood of New Haven then married and raised children in the city during the 1960s and 1970s. She discusses her memories of that period. An African American woman, Tucker took an interest in civil rights issues as a teenager. Her older brother was chair of the local branch of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and she became a member. Her brother forbade her to travel to the South with him to protest, but she participated in sit-ins in New Haven. As an adult, she became a member of First and Summerfield Church because she appreciated its social activism, its interracial congregation, and the political engagement of its pastor, Jim Davis. Tucker discusses the convergence of the Civil Rights movement with the anti-Vietnam demonstrations. Tucker was active in civil rights work. While she opposed the war, she felt that many antiwar demonstrators did not support soldiers and thus did not demonstrate against it. She discusses her impressions of the Black Panthers, whom she considered too militant. She remembers the May Day demonstrations in 1970 but did not take part because she stayed at home with her young children. She also comments favorably on Yale President Kingman Brewster and the student activists of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

                  <p>Charles Twyman, born in New Haven, discusses the ethnic enclaves in his neighborhood in the early 1920s, consisting of German- and Irish-Americans and, to a lesser extent, African-Americans. He shares anecdotes about his childhood friends and neighbors. Twyman details his experiences as a soldier in the Army during World War II. He describes the effects of segregationist military policies on his interactions with his white peers and their effects on the perception of unity, purpose, and patriotism among his black peers. Recalling the phrase, "We don't take colored," he details the irony of encountering exemplary black soldiers, including the 10th Cavalry (the "Buffalo Soldiers"), who, because of their race, were largley relegated to service positions. He describes adjusting to civilian life after the army. He used the GI Bill of Rights to go to New Haven State Teacher's College, now Southern Connecticut University, taught at an integrated elementary school, and later got involved in local politics. He shares stories about his experiential teaching methods, including class visits to the courthouse and hospital. He recalls his confrontations with the racist attitudes and actions of some of his students. He talks about the permeability of segregation in all aspects of life, including local businesses and other public areas. He discusses his role as the Chairman of the Dixwell Community Council amidst Mayor Lee's urban renewal policies, describing his efforts to address the negative reactions of displaced residents including Black Coalition members.</p>

                  <p>Cheever Tyler, who grew up in California, moved to New Haven in 1964 to practice law. Beforehand, he attended Yale University, Michigan Law School, and served in the Navy. He describes what drew him to law, mentioning its political and policy foundations and its community interactions. He discusses his decision to move to New Haven after clerking at a New York law firm, preferring New Haven's urban resources, small-town familiarity, artistic venues, and community service networks. He reflects upon his thirty-year career at New Haven corporate law firm Wiggin &amp; Dana, which he describes as creating "a real sense of community." He compares the practices and traits of small/rural and big/urban law firms, discussing differences in popular cases, working environments, and community interactions. He shares anecdotes illustrating the professional and personal qualities of several of his most successful peers, including John Barnett, Dick Bell, Dick Bowerman, Bill Cavanaugh, and the late Newt Schenck. He provides other examples of lawyers in different settings and career junctures who devotedl time to community service. He also discusses the growing difficulty of offering pro bono services amidst inflation and rising professional costs. Tyler discusses his interpretation of the varying aspects of volunteerism in the legal practice and the professional and ethical responsibilities of lawyers. He talks fondly about the collegiality among lawyers within and among firms and the role of lawyers as participants in the larger community.</p>

                  <p>Moses Vargas, born in Michoacan, a Mexican state, has lived in East Haven since 1986, before which he lived in New York City and North Branford. A cook and Mexican restaurant owner, Vargas describes several of his signature ingredients, recipes, and cooking methods inspired by his mother and grandmother. He reflects upon his happiness with his job, including the regular customers, the safe neighborhood, and the opportunity to improve his cooking skills by participating in competitions. He recalls that his interest in cooking came not from any formal training but after his brother helped him get a job as a dishwasher in a New York country club. He also describes his business' challenges, including the difficulty of financially managing during the winter, when many of his Mexican customers return to Mexico for the warm weather. He talks about the difficulty of not being able to open restaurants in surrounding cities because of permit complications. Still, he describes cooking as both a passion and a responsibility, giving him a sense of self and allowing him to support his wife and two children. He struggles with whether he considers Mexico or the United States his real "home," and what that means. But he maintains that while living in Mexico among extended family members gives his family sentimental and cultural value, living in the United States provides his family with political liberties, economic stability, and educational opportunities. He describes the economic, political, and cultural differences between his neighborhood in Michoacan and that in East Haven and the changes he's noticed in both over the years.</p>

                  <p>Eugene Vitelli, born and raised in New Haven, describes his forty-year career as a teacher and administrator in several New Haven high schools: Hillhouse High School, Fair Haven, and Wilbur Cross. He describes the 1967 and 1970 black student-led, Black-Panther influenced race riots at Hillhouse, and explains what he thinks led to the riots. He mentions that some black students felt that Hillhouse staff favored and spent more time with white students, using more resources to help them prepare for college students than those on black students. He also mentions that some black students believed that the mainly white teachers overlooked and omitted black literature in the English and history curriculum, overlooking minority, and especially black, experiences and viewpoints. He adds that he believes that part of the staff's greater emphasis on white students and Anglo-American curricula stemmed from their unfamiliarity and discomfort in interacting with minority students. In discussing the varied reactions to the riots, Vitelli recalls his own efforts to address student complaints and restore school order. These efforts, he concedes, were unconvincing to the many white students who chose to transfer from Hillhouse to other high schools, such as Richard C. Lee High school, Notre Dame High School, and Ezra Academy, which soon became overwhelmingly white. He reflects that the black majority student body at Hillhouse is still apparent today. Vitelli recalls the difficulty of negotiating with white and black students, teachers, administrators, police, and parents, each of whom had different opinions of the cause of the riots and different visions for its settlement.</p>

                  <p>Susan Voigt was the child of Jewish immigrant parents, born three years after the family's arrival in the United States. After graduating from college, she opened a restaurant on Grand Avenue in Fair Haven with her older brother, who had previous experience in the nightclub business. At the time of the interview, Voigt's restaurant had been in operation for 27 years, surviving a number of economic downturns and the changing demographics of Fair Haven. She describes a failed 1990s attempt to gentrify Fair Haven, suggesting that such good natured designs might be effective in theory, but stumbled in practice. Even so, Voigt describes a remarkable resurgence in Fair Haven over the last eight or so years. This improvement was not necessarily government led, but resulted from Fair Haven residents taking responsibility for cleaning up their own communities. Voigt talks about the importance of home ownership to community morale. She describes her family's immigration experience, and suggests the importance of immigration to the culture of Fair Haven over the years.</p>

                  <p>Paula Walker moved from New York to New Haven in the late 1990s, and now lives with her family in the Chatham Square neighborhood in Fair Haven. Walker describes a divide in her neighborhood between residents who own their own homes, and those who rent homes from absentee landlords. The latter class, Walker suggests, tends to be less invested in the upkeep of their residences, and less engaged with the health of the community. Walker organizes weekly events for children in a Fair Haven park in order to encourage community. Walker is also active in the Community Foundation, a grassroots community organization dedicated to Fair Haven. Walker mentions that the New Haven Police Department tends to ignore Fair Haven, suggesting that "unless you're selling drugs or getting shot the cops usually don't respond very fast to most things here." In general, Walker is proud of her neighborhood and pleased to live with there. With a little more pride and respect on the part of certain residents, she suggests, Chatham Square could be made even better.</p>

                  <p>After serving in Europe in World War II, Malcolm Webber moved to New Haven in 1968 to work for the Anti-Defamation League, which he describes as the "community relations agency" for the Jewish community of Connecticut. When the movement to erect a Holocaust memorial in New Haven got underway, Webber and his wife involved themselves immediately. On a trip to Europe, Webber visited Auschwitz. He collected some dirt which, he says, contained the ashes of Holocaust victims. Webber brought the ashes back to New Haven, where they were interred below the memorial. In addition, Webber discusses his efforts to write a Holocaust unit for use in Connecticut schools, which, up to that point, had failed to provide sufficient coverage. He describes the birth of the Yale Holocaust survivors video collection, which provided an opportunity for local survivors to share their testimony, and a means to ensure that these stories were not lost to history. Webber and his wife, who is present for most of the interview, compare their impressions of the Holocaust to other genocides in the world today.</p>

                  <p>Paul Wessel talks about empowering and organizing communities and small business owners in and near New Haven. He discusses his experiences developing, organizing, and improving merchant organizations. He mentions the Livable City Initiative, an anti-blight urban housing program, and GAVA, the Grand Avenue Village Association, an organization of local merchants along Grand Avenue. He talks about common platform issues in both organizations, such as health care and health insurance, municipal planning and economic development, immigrant involvement and representation, city-hired instead of locally hired employees, and negotiation among contesting visions of progress and fairness. He details his leadership roles in GAVA and its past and current aims, strengths, and weaknesses. He discusses its collaborations with other labor initiatives, such as SAMA, the Spanish American Merchant Association. He talks about interacting socially and politically with business owners and aldermen to continue the economic development of New Haven and Fair Haven communities.</p>

                  <p>From the 1950s through the early 2000s, Manson Witlock operated a typewriter repair shop on Broadway Street and later York Street. He discusses his life as a small business owner in New Haven and the changes that he has seen living in the area for over seventy years. Whitlock's father owned a turkey farm in Bethany and his family also owned bookstores in Bethany. Whitlock begins by talking about the 1950s and the election of Mayor Richard C. Lee, one of his classmates at Hillhouse High School. Whitlock talks a bit about Lee's urban renewal projects but says that he did not feel that affected by him. However, he admits missing the shopping in department stores that were demolished as part of the redevelopment work. He cites Yale's decision to become co-educational as a major turning point in the downtown and campus environment. His interview touches on the race riots and the tensions of the 1960s and 1970s, but Whitlock maintains that he tried to simply ignore the turmoil as much as he could. He remained busy until the 1980s, when computers began to replace typewriters. Rent spikes in the 1990s also affected his business. But at the time of the interview in 2004 he continued to service typewriters.</p>

                  <p>Ed Winnick grew up in Woodbridge and New Haven. He attended Dartmouth College, served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, and went to Yale Law School. He talks about what drew him to law school, identifying his law-practicing family members as influences. He discusses working for his first law firm, Winnick &amp; Winnick, and focusing on negligence practice. He mentions several specific cases undertaken by his firm over the years. He talks about the congeniality he's encountered between lawyers within and among firms, listing peers he described as successful lawyers, such as Morris Tyler. He describes the historic ethnic and religious exclusivity of lawyer-populated country clubs. Ironically, it is this exclusivity that was a product of the congeniality that created and enhanced legal relationships. He talks about representing small Jewish businesses and the extent that legal decisions may affect personal relationships, and vice versa.</p>

                  <p>Karen Wolffe, who came to New Haven in 1969, helped found High School in the Community. HSC focused on teaching by experience instead of memorization. She recalls how her experiences as a civil rights worker in SNCC influenced her vision of schools and teachers exposing young people to tolerance. She talks about the reaction of outside school officials to HSC's no-textbook curriculum, open-ended teaching methods and philosophy, and its lack of administrators. She describes the challenges and rewards of founding a school and academically and personally interacting with unmotivated students. She talks about the classroom as a community in which students learn about and from each other. She shares anecdotes describing her efforts to make her curriculum applicable to her students' daily lives.

                  <p>Doris Zelinsky, the daughter of Polish Holocaust survivors, was a member of the first class of women admitted to Yale College. After graduating, Zelinsky remained in New Haven to work for the Office of Policy Analysis under Mayor Frank Logue and became involved with the erection of a memorial to Holocaust survivors in the city. Zelinsky tells the story of a day in late 1976 when a group of survivors and members of the New Haven Jewish Federation came to the Mayor's office to ask for a parcel of city land on which to build the memorial. Zelinsky explains that this was an unusual request because the monument was not for people from New Haven and because there were few similar memorials in the United States at the time. She remembers that the proposal confused some people, such as Logue's assistant Rosa DeLauro. But, she recounts, Mayor Logue took great interest in the proposal and helped see it through to its inauguration the following year. She discusses her experiences as the commemoration ceremony and its rededication ceremony in 1981. Zelinsky further recounts Logue's commitment to the proposal and the culture of monument building in the United States at the time. She also talks about her parents' experiences as survivors and the stories that she heard from other survivors growing up. Finally, she discusses her involvement in the creation of a video documentary to capture the oral histories of survivors. Ed Zelinsky, her husband and an Alderman, helped with this project.</p>

                  <p>Ed Zelinsky left Omaha to attend Yale College in 1968, then graduated from Yale Law School and remained in New Haven as an attorney and a member of the Board of Alderman. He discusses his childhood and adult involvement in Jewish affairs, his entry into city politics in the 1970s and his involvement in the construction of the Holocaust Memorial at Edgewood Park. Zelinsky discusses the political climate of the 1970s. Running as a reform Democrat, he became the first Yale student elected to the Board of Alderman. He shared this political affiliation with friend Frank Logue, who beat incumbent Bart Guida in the 1975 mayoral race. Zelinsky then discusses his role in appealing for the Holocaust Memorial. The New Haven Jewish Federation brought the proposal for the memorial to Mayor Logue in 1976. Although they proposed the New Haven Green for the site initially, the city ultimately decided to construct it in Edgewood Park. This was part of Zelinksy's Aldermanic ward so he represented his constituency in favoring the project. He recounts Frank Logue's support for the project, his memories o the 1977 dedication ceremony, and his views on the 1981 expansion of the memorial.</p>
