         <p>The Central Committee Knesseth Israel was a charitable organization of the Ashkenazic Jewish community in Jerusalem founded in 1866 to provide financial support to needy individuals and religious institutions. According to Mark Wischnitzer's 1946 report prepared for the Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds, its "activities included financial relief to needy members of the Kolelim [institutes for advanced Talmud study], free loans, support of various institutions, promotion of vocational training, distribution of matzoth and holiday gifts, and the supervision of holy places and religious observances."</p>
