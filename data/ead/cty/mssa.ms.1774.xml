Of particular interest are the publications of synagogues in London and other centers of Jewish life in England commemorating special occasions in the life of the congregation or major events taking place in Great Britain. These include sermons preached by the local rabbi, editions of special prayer services in honor of the consecration of a synagogue, and memorial services for notable Jewish personages and for members of the royal family. Among the prayer pamphlets found in the collection are those held in many synagogues when England entered World War I and II and in memory of those who died in those wars. The bylaws and financial records of many congregations are also included in the collection as well as the publications of lectures on various topics delivered there. The collection provides a broad picture of Jewish religious, communal, and social life over a period of more than a hundred years.</abstract>

         <p>Asher Lewis Shane was born in the Welsh Valley. His desire to study law brought him to London where he placed first in the All England Laws Exams of 1933. After practicing commercial law and serving in the military during World War II, he established a highly successful real estate development company. At the time of its sale in the early 1980s, his company was the largest privately held property company in the United Kingdom. Mr. Shane also served as president of the Jewish Historical Society of which he was a member for some forty years, and for which he wrote several scholarly papers. Shane began collecting as a young man. Over time, he developed a large library of antiquarian and rare books, atlases, travel books and prints. His interest was focused especially on the history of European Jewry, particularly in England.</p>
