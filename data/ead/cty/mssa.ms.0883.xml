         <p>Norman White Cary, son of Rev. Josiah Addison and Gertrude (Jenkins) Cary, was born in New York City, New York, on October 29, 1849. He was prepared for college at the Rev. Dr. J. W. Faire's Classical Institute, Philadelphia, and Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. He graduated from Yale with the class of 1870 and received an A.M. from Yale in 1873. That same year, he also graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary. He entered the ministry of the Presbyterian Church and was pastor over numerous churches along the east coast and in the northern Midwest. Around 1885, he had the desire to teach and began a school in North Dakota, then moved to Baltimore to learn chemistry and physics at Johns Hopkins University. He quickly returned to the ministry, though, and eventually also began selling life insurance. He and his wife, Hannah S. Craig had three children Addison Reading (1886), Medora Alice (1888), and Norman Leroy (1892). He died on May 11, 1928.</p>

               <p>The records consist of letters exchanged between Norman White Cary and his mother and sister during his four years as a Yale College student. There are also several letters from classmates and other friends. Mrs. Cary, who was the head of a school for young ladies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was an anxious and over-protective parent who wrote once a week and insisted on prompt answers. As a result, Cary's letters provide a continuous and detailed record of his life at Yale between 1866 and 1870, including his studies and finances, social and cultural events, student activities and societies, and general information about life in New Haven. The letters of his mother and sister in turn describe family happenings, their school, and social and cultural events in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cary's letters are heavily laden with intense solicitude for Cary's physical and moral well-being.</p>
               <p>The letters are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
