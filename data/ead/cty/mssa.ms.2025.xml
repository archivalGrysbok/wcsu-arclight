         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Good Vibrations was founded in 1977 by Joani Blank in San Francisco, California. Blank is a sex educator and sex therapist who taught classes and led therapy groups on different aspects of human sexuality throughout the 1970s. Blank also operated Down There Press, which published books, pamphlets and guides for sexual self-help. Good Vibrations was opened as a response to requests for a "clean, well-lighted place" to shop for sex toys and books. It was established as a feminist, sex-positive environment that serves all genders and all sexualities. The store also offers sex education workshops on a variety of topics related to sexuality and sexual practices. The business also has a mail-order business and catalog. Today, the mail order business continues through the company website. The business became a cooperatively owned establishment with all the employees in 1992. In 1994, Joani Blank left the company to pursue other interests. In 2006, Good Vibrations changed from a cooperative model to a corporate model of ownership. As of 2015, Good Vibration operates seven stores in California, mainly in and around San Francisco, one store in Brookline, Massachusetts, and an online site. Good Vibrations also produces its own erotic videos as part of their video production company Good Releasing.</p>
