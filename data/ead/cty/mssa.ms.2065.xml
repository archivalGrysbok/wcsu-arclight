Wilhelm participated in several anti-war groups in New Haven, including the Committee of Fifteen, a group of Yale faculty and staff, and the American Independence Movement. The majority of the collection consists of ephemera, including newspaper clippings, bulletins, statements of organizations, and booklets. Newspaper clippings are from both Connecticut-based and national newspapers, such as the <title>

            </title> and the <title>
               New York Times
            </title>. Bulletins are from several anti-war/peace organizations, most of them local to New Haven. These include the American Independence Movement, Draft Action Group, Peace Community News, and the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors. There are also materials related to two specific events, the May Day Rally and the "Un-sell the War" campaign. Materials date from 1967 to 1971.</abstract>
