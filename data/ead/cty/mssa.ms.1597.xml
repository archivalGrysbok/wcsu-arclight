         <p>Loring Kenneth Jordan</p>
         <p>1888 Nov 1 -</p>
         <p>Our request for his history since 1919 brought the following response from Jordan: "There is only one answer to this question, WORK and more WORK. Most of 1910 was spent in graduate work at Sheff. After a few months in ranch experience in Idaho, my residence was entirely in engineering and construction on hydraulic and hydroelectric projects as assistant engineer and engineer for various concerns; among them were â€“ H.M. Byllesby &amp; Company, the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, the Western States Power Company, the Colony Holding Corporation, the Crocker Huffman Company, the Marin Water &amp; Power Company, the Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District, and, after 1818, as manager of the Moulton Water Company.</p>
         <p>"I have lived all over California â€“ Oakland, San Francisco, Redding, Merced, Colfax, Auburn, etc., are a few of the towns and way stations, not to mention Sacramento or various others, as well as construction camps. My residence was for eight years in the town of Colussa, where I endeavored to follow a Yale tradition and do some public-spirited work. I served as president of the high school trustees there and also a term on the grammar school trustees and mixed up in most all of the activities of a small community. Of course, I got small thanks for it.</p>
         <p>"My hobbies are few â€“ duck and deer hunting and trout fishing when there is an opportunity and golf and horseback riding some.</p>
         <p>"My general charge of the land interests of C.W. Clarke Company keeps me covering a large territory, as these holdings comprise some 80,000 acres of properties in this state, which are scattered widely. Some are three hundred miles south of here and some more than three hundred miles north, and at all stages in between, so I cover a district similar to that from Maine to Virginia. For years I have had to spend the most of my time in an automobile and am not far from finishing my first million miles of driving. I still have hopes of a ship."</p>
         <p>The C.W. Clarke Company is a private property corporation, and the North Fork Ditch Company is a private property corporation, and the North Fork Ditch Company is a public utility water company. Jordan belongs to the El Paso Country Club, and he is a Democrat and a Mason. He was married December 24, 1914, at St. Joseph, Mo., to Grace Wilma, daughter of George Henry and Barbara (Bechtel) Hoover. Mrs. Jordan attended Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. The Jordans have two children, Loring Kenneth, Jr. born December 1, 1915, at Atascadero, Calif., and Nina Vinette, born September 13, 1917, at Redding, Calif.</p>

         <p>William Amos Jordan</p>
         <p>1893 Jan 11 -</p>
         <p>Jordan has been with the Southern New England Telephone Company since 1915. In August, 1942, he was transferred from New Haven to Middletown, Conn., as manager in charge of the Middletown, East Hampton, and Moodus exchanges, but since March, 1948, has been back in New Haven in his present capacity. During the war he was chairman of the Middletown War Finance Committee (War Bond drives) and a member fo the general committee of the War Council and of the Middletown Transportation Committee. He is a member of the Church of the Redeemer in New Haven, during the period from 1939 to 1942 being clerk of the church, and while living in Middletown he served for three years as a trustee of the First Church of Christ, Congregational. Jordan belongs to Wooster Lodge, No. 79, A.F. and A.M., in New Haven.</p>
         <p>"My only travels, outside of New England," he says, "have been an annual trip to Missouri to visit my mother, who was 100 years old on July 24, 1951, and who is still active and mentally alert. My only hobby at the present time is gardening. During the last twenty years I have devoted much time to figure skating and have been a member of the New Haven Skating Club. I did a little stamp collecting, and I still keep up a collection of Yale Football memorabilia that makes it possible for me to check facts about every game Yale has played since we entered college."</p>
         <p>On June 15, 1918, he was married in Woodmont, Conn., to Marion Josephine Porter, daughter of George Willis and Mathilde Von Noll Friedrich Porter. Their daughter, Mary Porter, who was born in New Haven, December 5, 1924, received a B.A. Degree at Vassar in 1945 and an M.A. at Wesleyan in 1947. She married Newell Charlton Gilbert, Washington and Lee '41, son of Frank Wellington Gilbert, Yale '16, and has a son, Charlton Hovenden, born on January 2, 1951.</p>
