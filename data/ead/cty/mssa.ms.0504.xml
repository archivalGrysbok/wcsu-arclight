The Civil War papers include letters from Lt. Col. Andrew Terry, among them one describing the capture of Roanoke Island in 1862. The Virginia papers are largely records of the Lee and Fendall families (1811-1865). In addition there is a letter written by Henry Clay on the election of 1848. A small number of papers pertain to Morton C. Treadway, the collector of these items, and document his activities as treasurer of the Horton Manufacturing Company and his service as treasurer of the Yale College class of 1910.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This small collection of letters and other items given to Yale University by Morton Candee Treadway in 1952 consists of papers pertaining to several unrelated people.</p>
         <p>Folder 1 contains two letters written to Richard Bland Lee (1761-1827) about lands in Virginia. Further Lee family correspondence is found in folders 2-5, included in a group of papers pertaining to Phillip Richard Fendall (1794-1868). Fendall was a Princeton graduate who practiced law in the District of Columbia. He was related to the Lees, and their letters to him deal with personal and legal matters. The remaining papers deal with legal and political matters, including a claim against the Union Army by George Mason for destruction of his property, and an attestation of his loyalty to the U.S. Government. Also among these papers is a letter from Henry Clay (1848 Jun 6) concernining money lent to Columbia College and concerning the elections of 1848.</p>
         <p>Folders 6-7 contain general orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Terry in 1862 from the Union Army, and the letters from Terry to his brother. Terry was stationed on the steam " <emph render="italic">Chasseur</emph>" off North Carolina, and his letter of 1862 Feb 11 describes a battle fought at Roanoke Island on February 6-7.</p>
         <p>Folders 8-9 contain papers pertaining to Morton C. Treadway. Included are letters written to the Horton Manufacturing Company by Joseph Jefferson concerning fishing equipment (there is also one letter from Jefferson to Grace Ella (Seymour) Ingraham), letters to Treadway from Chenting T. Wang and Carl A. Lohmann concerning the Yale class of 1910 and a portrait of Robert Taft, and a letter from John Huston Finley (1935 Aug 25) enclosing a photograph of Grover Cleveland and William C. Boyden.</p>
         <p>The final item in the collection is an undated autograph of Kathleen Norris.</p>
