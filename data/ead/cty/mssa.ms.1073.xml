         <p>The James Stewart McDermott Papers consist almost entirely of letters that McDermott wrote to his mother and sister from Yale College (1938 Sep-1942 Apr), Quantico, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. (1942 May-1944 Jan), Camp Pendleton (1944 Mar-Sep), and various unspecified locations in the Pacific (1944 Sep-1945 Feb). Besides many observations about ordinary events at Yale and in the Marine Corps, there are accounts of conversations with Maury Maverick, U.S. Representative from Texas, and James Grafton Rogers, deputy director of the Office of Strategic Services, and descriptions of social life in wartime Washington.</p>
