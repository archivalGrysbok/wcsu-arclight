         <abstract id="aspace_61abce852ecf8430069185de4cbddb58">The papers of Alexander M. Bickel include correspondence; writings, both published and unpublished; memoranda on legislation and government policy; papers from his legal practice; papers relating to his teaching at the Yale Law School; and personal papers and photographs. Bickel's writings as well as his legal cases reflect his general political position as a classical liberal, and revolve around such issues as segregation in the schools, racial discrimination, the role of the Supreme Court in American life and politics, separation of powers, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. From 1958 until his death, Bickel often assisted in drafting social legislation. As the papers document, most prominent among these efforts was his share in the school desegregation legislation (1970-1974). His interest in the reform of the Democratic Party is shown in such materials as drafts of testimony before the Credentials Committee of the Party (1968). His active support for Charles H. Percy in 1967 and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 is shown by substantive correspondence and memoranda from these years. As an editor of <title render="italic">
               The New Republic
            </title> he wrote on legal and political issues, contributing many signed and unsigned editorials and articles. His extensive writing and reviewing for other popular magazines and in monograph form are supported in the papers with correspondence and drafts. His service in the U. S. Army during World War II and his work with the High Commissioner for Germany and the State Department in the early 1950s are also documented.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Alexander M. Bickel Papers consist of eighty-four archives boxes of letters, notes, drafts, and printed and near-print matter related to his work in scholarship, journalism, teaching, politics, government, and law. All phases of his career are well represented from his editing of Brandeis's<emph render="italic">Unpublished Opinions</emph>to the posthumous publication of<emph render="italic">The Morality of Consent</emph>except that few items document his classroom work. His earlier activities in law and diplomacy are represented thinly or not at all, and there is nothing antedating his clerkship with Judge Magruder.</p>

         <p>Alexander Mordecai Bickel, professor in Yale Law School and contributing editor of <title render="italic">
               The New Republic
            </title>, was a pre-eminent scholarly and popular authority on the Constitution, the Supreme Court, and the roles of the several branches of government in shaping public policy. Speaking and writing as teacher, scholar, lawyer, journalist, Democrat, and adviser to government officials, he was in the 1960s and early 1970s an important contributor to national discussion of such legal and political subjects as school desegregation, reapportionment, the Electoral College, the interpretation of the First Amendment, the powers of the President, the significance of the Warren Court, and the meaning of the liberal tradition. These are among the principal events in his personal and professional life:</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series I, CORRESPONDENCE, consists of several thousand letters and a few memoranda, of conversations arranged in three sections: <emph render="italic">Incoming, Outgoing,</emph> and <emph render="italic">Invitations Refused</emph>. The outgoing correspondence is fragmentary before 1960. The incoming and outgoing letters have been separated and differently arranged to facilitate retrieval by subject (as suggested by the chronology of Bickel's preoccupations) as well as correspondent. But the papers in this series constitute, at most, a large fraction of the correspondence found in Bickel's files after his death. Many letters have been placed in other series because they belong to the record of some special activity. Cross-references in the folder listing for the <emph render="italic">Incoming</emph> section of this series make it possible to locate these by writer except in the case of routine exchanges with editors, secretaries, conference organizers, and congressional committee staff. Requests to speak in public or write for publication that Bickel did not accept have been set aside as <emph render="italic">Invitations Refused</emph> along with his replies.</p>
               <p>Bickel's varied career before he began teaching at Yale brought him a lasting acquaintance with several prominent men in American law and government. Among his earliest correspondents were Felix Frankfurter, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; Dean Acheson, former Secretary of State; Calvert Magruder, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals, First Circuit; and Robert R. Bowie, director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff and later Assistant Secretary of State. But the letters of these men remaining among his papers may not be of great value to students of their careers. The most important are Acheson's recollections of his participation in <title render="italic">
                     United Mine Workers v. Coronado
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Duplex v. Deering
                  </title> as law clerk to Justice Brandeis (1955 Dec 7, 1964 May 27). Bickel gave Frankfurter's letters to Harvard Law School, leaving behind only a few memoranda and some slip opinions, and the Magruder and Bowie letters have little substance. The only letter from John J. McCloy, under whom Bickel served when he was High Commissioner in Germany, is a note transmitting a recent speech.</p>
               <p>As Bickel's reputation grew, members of Congress became interested in his opinions, and his correspondence broadened accordingly. Many of the longest and most important sequences of letters in this category have been placed in Series V-VIII. What remains in this series are mainly isolated requests for Bickel's opinion. A few of these letters, such as those by Senators Birch Bayh, Edward M. Kennedy, and Joseph Tydings, bespeak a continuing association, but neither these inquiries nor the occasional form letters from other members of Congress add much to the public record of the writers' activities and opinions.</p>
               <p>Bickel was also a friend or occasional correspondent of several members of the Nixon administration. The letters of Daniel P. Moynihan, assistant for urban affairs and ambassador to the United Nations, and Leonard Garment, adviser on civil rights, show that both men provided a channel of communication between Bickel and the President. Other letters of Nixon aides can be found in Series VI. The significance of Bickel's association with Nixon appointees outside the White House is more difficult to estimate. All the correspondence with his friend Robert Bork occurred before he was named Solicitor General, and most of the letters by cabinet member Elliot Richardson merely acknowledge congratulations on his successive appointments. Bickel was also acquainted with men serving in the three previous administrations, but the letters they exchanged provide no evidence of access to the president or influence on his ideas. Texts of speeches accompany the letters of Moynihan, Donald F. Turner, and several other presidential appointees.</p>
               <p>Many other incoming letters were written by Bickel's professional colleagues, a few working in the federal government but most teaching or practicing law. These tended to be personal associations as well, and the subjects are correspondingly mixed. Exchanges of ideas and of first-hand information about historically important events are far less common than reports of personal news and transactions of routine professional business, but there are a few exceptions. The letters of Philip Elman include a recollection of the <title render="italic">
                     Rosenberg
                  </title> case (1966 Jan 20, after he had left the Solicitor General's Office) and several observations about his work as Federal Trade Commissioner. The letters of Eugene V. Rostow include discriminating reactions to Bickel's writings, lengthy expressions of opinion on domestic and foreign policy questions, and texts, of speeches and essays. Those of Frederick B. Wiener are rich in comment on current legal and political events. Among the federal judiciary, Bickel's principal correspondent was Henry J. Friendly, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, whose letters contain favorable comments on Bickel's writings and other expressions of esteem.</p>
               <p>The major letters in the <emph render="italic">Outgoing</emph> section are those containing lengthy comments on issues of the day, most addressed to public officials but a few composed for the benefit of friends and colleagues. Most of these were written in response to requests for his opinion. Among the topics are passport regulation (1959 Jul 8, to Senator J. William Fulbright), the presidential succession (1964 Jan 27, to Senator Hubert Humphrey), legislation to limit court-ordered reapportionment (1967 Jun 6, to Senator Howard Baker), judicial rule-making (1970 Jan 22, to Dean Acheson), and congressional imposition of a moratorium on the death penalty (1971 May 6, to Senator Philip Hart). Many of the subjects thus treated he also discussed in <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title>, and some were the focus of special activities documented in other series, but a letter in this series sometimes provides an earlier expression of his ideas. Other outgoing letters mix personal news and routine business in the manner of the incoming letters from friends and colleagues. Bickel rarely discussed with outsiders the details of important events in which he participated, but his letters do afford a few observations about the preliminaries to the Supreme Court decision in <title render="italic">

                  </title> (e.g., 1955 Dec 8, 1967 Sep 22, 1971 Mar 18).</p>

               <p>Series II, BOOKS, has items related to every one of Bickel's works. The most common element is correspondence with the publisher, dealing mainly with technical matters. There are also reviews of every volume published through 1975 except <title render="italic">
                     The Caseload of the Supreme Court
                  </title>. The holdings of drafts are much more variable. There are several posthumous versions of <title render="italic">
                     The Morality of Consent
                  </title> (edited by friends, as explained in a memorandum by Jeannette Hopkins, 1975 Mar 4) and partial texts of <title render="italic">
                     The Unpublished Opinions of Mr. Justice Brandeis
                  </title> (annotated by Felix Frankfurter), <title render="italic">
                     Politics and the Warren Court
                  </title>, and <title render="italic">
                     The New Age of Political Reform
                  </title>. Earlier versions of parts of most of the books can be found in Series III and IV in the form of speeches and articles. Besides the works published or committed for publication, there is a manuscript, "The Constitutional Law Primer," rejected by Harper &amp; Row. Bickel also planned an American government text with political scientists Nelson Polsby and Aaron Wildavsky, but the venture came to nothing, and the related correspondence has been placed in a closed file (APPENDIX).</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series III, SHORTER WRITINGS, has three sections: <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title>, <emph render="italic">Legal Articles and Journalism,</emph> and <emph render="italic">Book Reviews</emph>. The second of these combines "Articles in Legal Periodicals and in Books" and "Articles in Other Publications" in the printed bibliography.[1] "Most of Bickel's works are represented. For every title listed there is at least one form of the text ear sheets, a copy of the manuscript submitted to the editor, or (in relatively few cases) an earlier draft. In most instances there is correspondence with the editor, usually dealing more with technical matters than with content. There are also occasional letters from readers, but the reactions of public figures and of Bickel's friends and colleagues can be found instead in Series I. When an article credited to Bickel in the printed bibliography does not appear in the folder listing, it may be that no text was found in the papers, in which case any correspondence is in Series I; but some publications originated as addresses sponsored by the organizations that published them, in which case a manuscript of the text can usually be found in Series IV. Pieces written for publication but not printed are included in the appropriate sections.</p>
               <p>Bickel was an editor of <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title> as well as a contributor of signed articles and book reviews, and he occasionally corresponded with other editors about policy. His authorship of unsigned editorials is almost always shown by the survival of his draft or by his having marked his contribution on a tear sheet, but the appearance of a title in the folder listing should not be taken as proof of even partial authorship, He organized his <title render="italic">
                     New Republic
                  </title> files by subject, and he may have kept pieces written by others to complete his record of the journal's editorial stance, His editorials cover a wider range of legal subjects than his books, speeches, and signed articles.</p>

               <p>Series IV, PUBLIC SPEAKING, is similar in content to Series III. For every title listed there is some form of the text, most often a typed draft or handwritten notes, and usually there is also correspondence with the sponsor of the presentation. Most of the texts are speeches before academic or professional audiences, but there are also notes for after-dinner remarks and transcripts of panel discussions and broadcasts.</p>

               <p>Series V, SENATE JUDICIARY, documents Bickel's service as consultant to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers, chaired by Sam J. Ervin, Jr., and administered by Rufus L. Edmisten, Bickel helped plan the subcommittee's, program and contributed opinions on topics under investigation. The papers consist of correspondence, memoranda, committee prints, and prepared statements by Bickel and other witnesses (often printed after delivery) on these subjects: committee veto as a means of legislative oversight, constitutional amendment by state convention, executive privilege, impoundment of appropriated funds, and several topics related to the federal judiciary. Ervin's letters in this series and in Series I show his respect for Bickel but add little to the public record of his own constitutional thinking.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series VI, LEGISLATION, documents Bickel's collaboration with members of Congress and the executive branch in drafting legislation. As with Series V, the content of the papers overlaps considerably with newspaper accounts and government publications. There are letters, memoranda, congressional committee prints, and drafts of testimony in sections on these topics: <emph render="italic">Eighteen-year-old Vote, Electoral, College, Executive Agreements, Executive Information, School Desegregation, Standing to Sue, Subversive Activities, War Powers,</emph> and <emph render="italic">Wiretapping.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The section <emph render="italic">School Desegregation</emph> adds most to the public record. The major activity is Bickel's collaboration between 1970 and 1974 with United States Representative Richardson Preyer in developing legislation to provide alternatives to court-designed plans of school desegregation. Among the papers are some of Bickel's draft bills and his correspondence with Preyer and other members of Congress, especially William B. Spong, who sponsored similar measures in the Senate. A number of the remaining items relate to other congressional efforts to deal with school desegregation. These include Bickel's prepared statements for the Senate Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity and the House Committee on Education and Labor and his correspondence with Daniel P. Moynihan and other White House aides in a period when they were helping President Nixon develop a position on court-ordered busing.</p>
               <p>The other sections show Bickel in a more limited advisory role. <emph render="italic">War Powers</emph> and <emph render="italic">Executive Agreements</emph> document his assistance to several senators as draftsman, witness, and correspondent in legislating an increase in Congress's control over the President's use of military force abroad. <emph render="italic">Electoral College</emph> shows his collaboration with members of Congress, lawyers, and political scientists to develop proposals for reform as an alternative to abolition. <emph render="italic">Eighteen-year-old Vote</emph> reveals his assistance, in association with other constitutional scholars, to President Nixon and members of his staff in contending that the federal government could not impose this measure on the states except by constitutional amendment. <emph render="italic">Standing to Sue</emph> has Bickel's testimony opposing on constitutional grounds a bill designed to create citizen and taxpayer standing to bring suit to enforce the "establishment of religion" and "free exercise thereof" clauses of the First Amendment. Wiretapping has Bickel's endorsement (1958) of legislation to prevent wiretapping by private persons and regulate its use by government officials. Executive Information has his analysis of the problems of standing likely to occur in achieving enforcement of legislation to facilitate congressional access to information from the executive branch. Subversive Activities has a memorandum (1959) for Senator Thomas Dodd.</p>

               <p>Series VII, POLITICS, deals with Bickel's support for the presidential aspirations of Senators Charles H. Percy and Robert F. Kennedy in 1967 and 1968. His association with Percy (in conjunction with other Yale professors) was not a commitment to his hypothetical candidacy but merely an exploratory response to President Johnson's anticipated pre-emption of the Democratic nomination. The major items are Bickel's own writings: a lengthy letter naming the leading domestic and international problems of the nation and suggesting responses to them (1967 Oct 18), a defense of the negative income tax (1967 Nov 10), and three memoranda on crime control and civil disobedience. Percy responded favorably (Nov 3) to his moderate stance on withdrawal from Vietnam but criticized his ideas on race and poverty as narrowly economic and insufficiently sensitive to the value of local and personal initiative and participation.</p>
               <p>Bickel's support for the candidacy of Robert Kennedy was deep and unqualified, but the papers in this series reveal little about this foremost commitment of his political life, The major item is his memorandum for the senator's use, "Implementation of Federal Civil Rights Legislation." He explained his admiration for Kennedy and offered his final assessment of his career in several pieces in <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title> (Series III, 1968-1969) and an address before the Consular Law Society (Series IV, 1968 Oct 30). He had opposed Kennedy's nomination as Attorney General, and the file for that article has notes on Kennedy's response in conversation with Gilbert A. Harrison and Bickel's undated reassessment in the light of Kennedy's performance in the office (Series III, <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title>, 1961 Jan 9).</p>
               <p>Bickel occasionally recommended a colleague for a judicial or legal appointment, but the only other evidence of political activity on behalf of an individual is a letter to Connecticut Democratic leader Emilio Q. Daddario urging support of Joseph Duffey for the Senate nomination (Series I, 1970 Jun 4),</p>

               <p>Series VIII, COMMITTEES, consists of correspondence, memoranda, draft and final reports, speeches, and clippings documenting the activities of legal, political, and academic advisory bodies to which Bickel belonged or rendered aid. Several of these committees were created to propose reform of the Democratic Party or the federal courts. The others merely performed routine chores.</p>
               <p>Bickel was a member of the Democratic Party's <title render="italic">
                     Hughes Commission
                  </title> on the Democratic Selection of Presidential Nominees, but the papers in this section document little of its activity independent of his contribution. The major items are three drafts (the first not written by him) of his testimony on the Commission's behalf before the Credentials Committee of the 1968 Democratic National Convention; his memorandum on "Reforming the National Convention"; a preliminary version of the Commission's report, <title render="italic">
                     The Democratic Choice
                  </title>; and letters written during the following year by persons interested in implementing its proposals. Among Bickel's correspondents was Geoffrey Cowan, associate director of Commission staff, who transmitted a copy of his lengthy letter to Theodore H. White disputing White's account of Cowan's participation in <title render="italic">
                     The Making of the President, 1968
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Roughly concurrent with his membership on the Hughes Commission in the summer of 1968, Bickel took part in the efforts of the <title render="italic">
                     Committee for the Formation of the New Party
                  </title> to offer an alternative to the anticipated choice between major-party presidential candidates Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. The papers in this section consist of letters, committee mailings, research material on state election laws, and a Bickel memorandum on "Fourth Party Legal problems." It is not apparent how large a part he played in the committee's organization, but he met with members before July 31, recommended it to several correspondents, and agreed to serve as one of its candidates for presidential elector. He also supported a third-party candidacy in a speech before the Coalition for an Open Convention (Series IV, 1968 Jun 29) and in two final paragraphs he contributed to a <title render="italic">
                     New Republic
                  </title> editorial (Series III, 1968 Aug 3).</p>
               <p>Bickel was merely a consultant to the party's <title render="italic">
                     McGovern Commission
                  </title> on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, formed early in 1969, but the papers in this section provide a fairly full record of its activities as well as showing his personal contribution. Most of the items are letters, reports, and memoranda prepared by the Commission staff in multiple copies for the information of commissioners and consultants and sometimes the press as well. The memoranda for internal use supplement the public record by showing the staff's contributions to the development of proposals that eventually carried the endorsement of the entire Commission.</p>
               <p>Bickel's participation is documented mainly in a packet of materials he culled from his own Commission files and reproduced for the use of Theodore H. White in writing <title render="italic">
                     The Making of the President, 1972
                  </title>. His purpose was to trace the development of ideas about representation of minority groups and minority political views prior to the adoption in November 1969 of quotas for delegate selection, at which time he stopped collaborating with the Commission. (But see his <title render="italic">
                     New Republic
                  </title> editorial, Series III, 1970 Feb 7.) The items he selected have been kept with the covering letter. They include correspondence with Senator George McGovern and a memorandum of a conversation with him, notes on Commission and Commission staff meetings, and an exchange of letters with fellow consultant Richard Wade.</p>
               <p>Bickel was not affiliated with the party's <title render="italic">
                     O'Hara Commission
                  </title> on Rules, mate to the McGovern Commission, but merely testified before it. The papers in this section include his prepared statement, an exchange of letters with chairman James G. O'Hara, press releases, staff memoranda, reports, and copies of other witnesses' testimony.</p>
               <p>Bickel's other major stints of committee service were performed on behalf of the federal courts. In 1971 he participated in the Chief Justice's Special Advisory Group on Federal Civil Litigation; the following year, in the Study Group of the Federal Judicial Center on the Caseload of the Supreme Court. Notwithstanding the difference in name, both were formed at the request of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, and both met under the auspices of the Federal Judicial Center. Bickel's participation began in the summer of 1970, when he helped Burger develop ideas for an address before the American Bar Association. His contribution is documented in a memorandum of a telephone conversation (Jul 20) and an eight-page letter (Jul 23). There is no copy of the draft he annotated and returned to Burger. Their correspondence on court reform extended through the life of both committees, though concentrated in the second half of 1970. Their letters on other subjects are in Series I.</p>
               <p>Both committees met several times in Washington but transacted much of their business by mail. The papers related to their activities (in the sections <emph render="italic">Civil Litigation Advisory Group</emph> and <emph render="italic">Caseload Study Group)</emph> consist mainly of research material, letters and memoranda exchanged among members and with Federal Judicial Center staff, Bickel's notes on group meetings, and draft and final recommendations. The notes on meetings of the caseload study group include summaries of statements made by Supreme Court justices appearing before the committee.</p>
               <p>There is no evidence of reaction to the civil litigation advisory group's "Suggestions for Improving the Process of Federal Civil Litigation," nor of efforts to implement its proposals except Burger's speeches and his correspondence with Bickel. The case is very different for the caseload study group's recommendation of a National Court of Appeals. Among the items documenting reception of this proposal are clippings from newspapers, magazines, and legal periodicals; letters of former Chief Justice Earl Warren and Circuit Judge Clement F. Haynsworth responding to premature revelations of the group's conclusions; a transcript of the press conference releasing the finished report; and speeches and reports by justices, lawyers, and professional associations. Bickel's efforts on behalf of the recommendations included collaborating with the American Bar Association's Special Committee on Coordination of Judicial Improvements (reports in this series; correspondence in Series I), taking part in a televised debate on "The Advocates" (Series IV, 1973 post-Oct 11), and writing <title render="italic">

               <p>Series IX, CONFERENCES, relates to meetings sponsored by foundations and study centers for discussion of legal, political, and social problems: planning for the year 2000, medical experimentation on humans, government reogranization, civil disorder, the electoral process, and regulation of the press. The papers consist of correspondence with conference organizers, working papers prepared by participants, and transcripts of proceedings. The transcripts of the Conference on the Ethical Aspects of Experimentation with Human Subjects and the two meetings of the Working Party on Rights and Values of the Commission on the Year 2000 show Bickel as a major contributor to the discussion.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series X, LEGAL PRACTICE, consists of correspondence among lawyers, drafts of briefs and other legal writings, notes for oral argument, and legal papers and research material forwarded to Bickel by the attorneys with whom he collaborated and by others concerned in the cases. The correspondence is mainly routine, and neither the letters nor the enclosures add much to the formal statements of the facts. The special value of these papers lies rather in their resources for the study of Bickel's legal work. His service as law clerk is represented by his memorandum, "The Search and Seizure Issue," for Judge Magruder in <title render="italic">
                     Best v. United States
                  </title>. (His better-known memorandum for Justice Frankfurter in <title render="italic">
                     Brown v. Board of Education
                  </title> is in Series IV with other papers related to his law review article, "The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision" [1955].) The rest of the papers relate to his own formal and informal practice.</p>
               <p>The cases that most concerned Bickel as journalist and adviser to government officials were suits brought on behalf of black children to achieve desegregation of public schools. He was reluctant, however, to take part in such litigation because he did not want to risk compromising his reputation as a disinterested observer (<title render="italic">
                     United States v. Indianapolis School Board
                  </title>, 1972 Mar 16). When he did participate, he did so as a consultant, not appearing as a witness or being named as attorney of record. This series has sections related to three cases involving school desegregation; <title render="italic">
                     Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg, United States v. Indianapolis School Board
                  </title>, and <title render="italic">
                     Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>Bickel participated in <title render="italic">
                     Swann v. Charlotte:-Mecklenburg
                  </title> by providing the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) with an "Outline and Prospectus" of a brief <emph render="italic">amicus curiae</emph> to be filed with the United States Supreme Court. He argued that the constitutional obligation of "disestablishment of legally enforced segregation" did not require "enforcement by law of racial dispersal in the schools." The papers in this section include the "Outline and prospectus," CORE's brief <emph render="italic">amicus curiae</emph>, the Supreme Court's slip opinion annotated by Bickel, and his correspondence with Roy Innis, national director of CORE. Bickel elaborated the distinction in the prospectus and interpreted the Supreme Court's decision for the Senate Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity (Series VI, <emph render="italic">School Desegregation</emph>, 1970 Sep 24, 1971 Jun 15).</p>
               <p>In January 1970, the United States District Court closed the first phase of <title render="italic">
                     Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education
                  </title> by requiring the board to arrange that no minority constitute a majority in any Pasadena public school. The documentation of Bickel's interest begins a year later, with his first exchange of letters with Henry Marcheschi, a Pasadena businessman then conducting a successful campaign for a seat on the board as an opponent of forced busing away from neighborhood schools. His correspondence with Bickel between 1971 and 1974 deals with developments in Pasadena and with Bickel's collaboration with Congressman Richardson Preyer in drafting legislation to foster alternatives to the sort of plan the District Court had prescribed for Pasadena. Marcheschi also transmitted legal papers connected with the case and his own exposition of a plan to achieve "Voluntary Integration and Equal Educational Opportunity" while respecting the principle of neighborhood schools.</p>
               <p>When the Pasadena School Board decided in October 1973 to petition for modification of the District Court order, its attorneys began consulting with Bickel. From then until his death, Bickel was kept informed about the progress of the case, and he advised intermittently on its management. The papers belonging to this period of collaboration consist almost exclusively of letters addressed to Bickel and documents connected with the litigation. With the exception of an analysis (1974 May 18) of the court's opinion and order in response to the board's petition (May 3), Bickel's advice must be reconstructed from references in the letters he received.</p>
               <p>Bickel agreed to participate in <title render="italic">
                     United States v. Indianapolis School Board
                  </title> following an interim order (1973 Jul 20) of the United States District Court that certain suburban school districts assist in desegregating the Indianapolis public schools by accepting black children transferred from the city. The attorneys for the affected school districts had immediately begun an appeal, but at his suggestion they applied for a stay of proceedings pending the entry of a final order by the District Court. To this application he contributed a critique of a motion for stay and supporting brief drafted by the Office of the Attorney General of Indiana. His other contributions, made in person or by telephone, can only be inferred from incoming letters. It was also at his suggestion that the Indiana attorneys decided to contribute a brief <emph render="italic">amicus curiae</emph> to the Detroit school desegregation case <title render="italic">
                     Bradley v. Milliken
                  </title>, but his final illness prevented his own participation. Nowhere in the papers does he discuss the District Court's desegregation plan.</p>
               <p>Closely related to the school desegregation cases was <title render="italic">
                     De Funis v. Odegaard
                  </title>, in which a white citizen of Washington State sued for admission to the state university law school, claiming that in denying his application it had unconstitutionally discriminated against him because of his race. Bickel first took part in the summer of 1973, when De Funis's attorneys were preparing to appeal the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court to the Supreme Court of the United States. He was retained by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, on whose behalf he drafted two briefs <emph render="italic">amicus curiae</emph>. The first supported the appeal and the alternative petition for certiorari; the second, finished by a colleague, argued the case on the merits. Among the papers are attorneys' correspondence, briefs filed with the Supreme Court by the Anti-Defamation League and several other <emph render="italic">amici,</emph> and some of the documents filed with the state courts at various stages in the litigation. The United States Supreme Court remanded the matter to the Supreme Court of Washington for further proceedings, but Bickel did not take part in this later stage of the case.</p>
               <p>Two other matters raised Fourteenth-Amendment questions in contexts having nothing to do with race. The more substantial of these was the <title render="italic">
                     New Jersey Contingent Fees
                  </title> case, a pair of suits brought by trial lawyers to oppose the State Supreme Court's recently established schedule for determining the amount due the attorney when the fee was contingent on the size of the settlement. Bickel participated virtually from the beginning and played a large role in the day-to-day management of the case. The litigation followed a complicated course, moving repeatedly between the state and federal courts and up and down within each system, and procedural and jurisdictional problems were correspondingly prominent. Bickel was equally concerned with these matters and with the constitutional questions the new regulation raised, particularly with regard to the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and the clause in the New Jersey Constitution regarding judicial rule-making. The principal items documenting his contribution are letters, drafts, and notes for oral argument. Much of the consultation with fellow attorneys took place in meetings or over the telephone, but the letters are more informative than most of his legal correspondence. The papers also include briefs, motions, and opinions pertaining to every stage in the litigation.</p>
               <p>Some of the same constitutional questions were considered in the <title render="italic">
                     Connecticut Credit Rate Research Project
                  </title>, in which Bickel was retained with another lawyer to study the prospects for successful litigation against a state statute allowing retailers to charge no more than one per cent monthly interest in open-credit plans. They concluded that the statute might be held to violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by not imposing the same requirement on other lenders, but advised that the courts would probably reject this interpretation. The papers in this section consist of research material, correspondence, and draft and final versions of the commissioned memorandum.</p>
               <p>The free-speech and free-press guarantees of the First Amendment were a second focus of Bickel's legal career. In <title render="italic">
                     New York Times Co. v. United States
                  </title> (the Pentagon Papers case) and in several other matters commanding national attention, he argued for the protection of the First Amendment. In <title render="italic">
                     Buckley v. AFTRA
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Lewis v. AFTRA
                  </title>, he defended the position of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists that it could require commentators on public affairs to pay membership costs without abridging their First Amendment rights.</p>
               <p>Most of the papers related to <title render="italic">
                     New York Times Co. v. United States
                  </title> are part of the formal record of the case: transcripts of proceedings in the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals, the government brief filed with the latter, briefs of both parties filed with the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court opinion, and various orders, memoranda, affidavits, and petitions. The principal items documenting Bickel's contribution are his preliminary outline (with Floyd Abrams, of counsel to the <title render="italic">

                  </title>) of the oral argument before the District Court and his notes for oral argument before the Court of Appeals. His name precedes that of William E. Hegarty (another attorney for the <title render="italic">
                     Times
                  </title>) on the brief supporting the <title render="italic">
                     New York Times's
                  </title> petition to the Supreme Court opposing the Appellate Court's restraining order, but there is nothing to show their respective contributions. The correspondence, all of it following the Supreme Court decision, is routine except for an exchange between Bickel and Hegarty (1971 Jul 19-28) on the merits of leaving it to the political process to prevent undue exercise of prior restraint. Bickel's letter to Judge Henry J. Friendly explains his unsuccessful request for a Sunday session, comments on the significance of the provenance of the disputed documents, and makes a comparison with Justice Frankfurter's position in the <title render="italic">
                     Rosenberg
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Steel Seizure
                  </title> cases.</p>
               <p>Bickel's efforts on behalf of Earl Caldwell, a reporter for the <title render="italic">
                     New York Times
                  </title>, began in May 1971, when the <title render="italic">
                     Times
                  </title> was preparing to oppose the government's petition to the Supreme Court (in <title render="italic">
                     United States v. Caldwell
                  </title>) to reverse an order of the United States Court of Appeals. That court had itself reversed a District Court order compelling Caldwell to reveal to a grand jury the source of his news information. Bickel cooperated not only with the <title render="italic">
                     Times
                  </title> but also with counsel to several publishing and broadcasting companies that were interested in the <title render="italic">
                     Caldwell
                  </title> case or in concurrent litigation ( <title render="italic">
                     Branzburg
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     Pappas
                  </title>) raising similar questions. The major items showing Bickel's contribution to <title render="italic">
                     Caldwell
                  </title> are his drafts of the brief filed with the United States Supreme Court by the <title render="italic">
                     New York Times
                  </title> as <emph render="italic">amicus curiae</emph>. The most important letters are those of E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., attorney for Paul Pappas, enclosing a letter from the <title render="italic">
                     Washington Post
                  </title> explaining its unwillingness to associate itself with Bickel's argument for a limited journalist's privilege. Also among the papers are briefs filed with the Court of Appeals (in <title render="italic">
                     Caldwell
                  </title>) and the Supreme Court (in <title render="italic">
                     Caldwell
                  </title>, <title render="italic">
                     Branzburg
                  </title>, and <title render="italic">
                     Pappas
                  </title>).</p>
               <p>Another case involving First Amendment claims was <title render="italic">
                     Oliver et al. v. Postel
                  </title>, in which a group of newspaper reporters brought an action against a New York Supreme Court justice who had, at the defendent's request, barred press and public from his courtroom during a criminal trial. The reporters first asked the Appellate Division of the same court to direct the judge to reopen the proceedings. When this petition was dismissed, they applied to the United States District Court for a restraining order. Bickel apparently made his main contribution to the federal proceedings, supplying the plaintiffs' attorneys with a lengthy memorandum arguing First Amendment and Sixth-Amendment questions. The papers in this section include Bickel's memorandum, the brief subsequently filed by the plaintiffs' attorneys, and other documents connected with the litigation. Earlier that year Bickel had advised the publishers of the Norfolk <title render="italic">
                     Virginian-Pilot
                  </title> on the constitutionality of an injunction forbidding publication of the names of juveniles charged with crime, but the correspondence and research materials (in the section <title render="italic">
                     Norfolk Juvenile Injunction
                  </title>) do not show what advice he gave.</p>
               <p>Bickel played a similar advisory role for the defense in <title render="italic">
                     United States v. Coffin et al
                  </title>., in which the government charged William Sloane Coffin, Jr., chaplain of Yale University, and four other men with counseling Selective Service registrants to evade military service and with conspiring to create nationwide resistance to the Selective Service System. He contributed four memoranda (1968 Feb 2 - Jun 9) mainly concerned with defining "speech" and "incitement" and applying the test of "clear and present danger." Other papers in this section include a critique of Bickel's first memorandum by a fellow Yale law professor, tests of Coffin's speeches and writings, the indictment, the government's memorandum opposing its dismissal, and the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals reversing the conviction obtained in the District Court. Bickel also wrote about the case in <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title> (Series III, 1968-1969).</p>
               <p>Bickel first took part in <title render="italic">
                     Buckley v. AFTRA
                  </title> in February 1973, when AFTRA's attorney was preparing to appeal the decision of the United States District Court finding unconstitutional any provisions of the National Labor Relations Act authorizing AFTRA to require broadcasters William F. Buckley, Jr., and M. Stanton Evans to belong to the union, pay it dues, or conform to its regulations. The major items showing Bickel's contribution are his draft brief and his notes for oral argument before the Court of Appeals. Besides his cooperation with AFTRA's attorney, he was interested in the refusal of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), subsequently <emph render="italic">amicus</emph> in the case, to associate itself with Buckley's position, and the papers in this section include copies of correspondence between Buckley and the ACLU and two ACLU memoranda on the constitutionality of the union shop. Finally, there are copies of most important papers filed with both federal courts.</p>
               <p>
                  <title render="italic">
                     Lewis v. AFTRA
                  </title> had the same attorneys arguing similar questions at the state level. The record of Bickel's participation begins in March 1973, with the ruling of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, that the National Labor Relations Act was not, as the lower court had held, unconstitutional in requiring Fulton Lewis, III, to pay dues to AFTRA as a condition of his employment as a broadcaster. The major items documenting Bickel's contribution are memoranda prepared by his research assistants before the brief was written and his own notes for oral argument. There are briefs, opinions, and other legal papers from all stages of the litigation. Bickel also assisted in the AFTRA case <emph render="italic">CBS v. Baldwin</emph>, but the issues there were not constitutional.</p>
               <p>Bickel concerned himself with freedom of the press as a practical and political problem when he evaluated certain proposals for self-regulation of news publishing and broadcasting. The papers in the section <emph render="italic">National Media Council</emph> consist of correspondence and of draft proposals and memoranda produced by the parties he advised. His involvement began in 1971, when the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) became interested in establishing an internal review board to entertain charges of bias in its reporting and to forestall an anticipated demand for government regulation. Lloyd N. Cutler, counsel to CBS, transmitted its draft proposal to Bickel, who accepted the idea of self-regulation as useful and reasonable but suggested modifications to increase its effectiveness and inspire public confidence (1971 Aug 7, 17). The following year Bickel gave advice to the director of the Twentieth Century Fund, whose task force on such proposals had recently issued its report. He suggested how such a body might, in its own investigations, respond to claims of the confidentiality of news sources (1972 Sep 26), and he commented on a draft charter and by-laws for a National Media Council (Oct 27).</p>
               <p>The other papers in this series command less attention because the questions raised are of narrower interest or there is little evidence of Bickel's contribution. His articles on the Special Prosecutor's standing to sue the President prompted a member of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force to thank him for thus contributing "the single most important factor in stimulating attention to these issues" (<title render="italic">
                     Watergate
                  </title>, 1974 Jun 21). In a matter connected with <title render="italic">
                     Villanova University
                  </title>, he wrote a memorandum showing how its defense of a legacy might be affected by the evolution of inheritance law in Pennsylvania and New York. In response to another inquiry he discussed how Puerto Rico might achieve statehood without immediately forfeiting all the tax advantages of Commonwealth status. In a matter that became <title render="italic">
                     Kerbs v. Watson
                  </title>, he advised on the prospects of forcing the Postmaster General to investigate the client's charges of tampering with her mail. On several other occasions he received material from lawyers and advised them on the questions they raised, but the letters he wrote in connection with these matters do not include the advice he gave.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Series XI, TEACHING, consists of correspondence, examinations, lectures, teaching material, and faculty and committee memoranda arranged in four sections: <emph render="italic">Yale Law School, Yale University, DeVane Lectures</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Other Institutions</emph>. The major items connected with Bickel's own teaching are these: his manual, "Constitutional Law," for the Clark-Whitman Bar Review Course; printed matter compiled for his courses in Yale Law School; and texts of his DeVane Lectures, delivered in Yale College in 1972 and 1973, The second set of DeVane Lectures was a major source for <title render="italic">
                     The Morality of Consent
                  </title> (Series II).</p>
               <p>The principal items unconnected with his own teaching relate to policy development in the university and the law school. Between 1967 and 1970 Bickel served on several university committees: the Advisory Committee on Education, the Committee on Disciplinary Policy, the Faculty Advisory Committee on the Colleges. There are letters, memoranda, and reports documenting the work of these bodies, but it is not evident that Bickel played a major role. Among the law school papers, the outstanding items are Bickel's memoranda on curriculum and discipline, written in 1968 and 1969 to counter laxity in faculty opinion. Most of the other papers in this series deal with routine business of institutional management and alumni relations. Bickel's correspondence with presidents of the university, deans of the law school, and many other Yale professors and administrators is in Series I.</p>

               <p>Series XII, STATE DEPARTMENT, consists of drafts, memoranda, and miscellaneous papers related mainly to Bickel's service with the U.S. Observer Delegation to the European Defense Community Conference and the Policy Planning Staff of the Department of State, Bickel himself prepared many of the drafts and memoranda for the use of his superiors, John J. McCloy and Robert R. Bowie. Within the first few years after leaving government service, he sought publication of a manuscript on "The American Situation in Europe" (Series III, folder 152), contributed articles on foreign policy to <title render="italic">
                     The New Republic
                  </title> (Series III, 1956-1957), and recommended disengagement from Quemoy and Matsu to the President and several senators (Series I, 1958 Oct 10), but after 1958 he did not publicize his positions on foreign affairs except in connection with the constitutional ramifications of the war in Vietnam (Series VI)</p>

               <p>Series XIII, MEMORABILIA, consists of law school notes, photographs, bibliographies, biographical data, and miscellaneous mementoes spanning from Bickel's days as a high school student to the establishment of the Alexander M. Bickel Professorship of Public Law.</p>
               <p>The papers listed in the APPENDIX have been set aside because they were formerly closed, even to users with general permission from the donor. Most were written under an assumption of confidentiality. The rest have been specially restricted to protect the privacy of Bickel, his correspondents, and persons named in their letters.</p>
               <p>Tape recordings of two of Bickel's public appearances (Series IV, folder 26; Series VI, folder 45) have been transferred to the Historical Sound Recordings Collection.</p>
               <p>The Alexander M. Bickel papers were given to Yale University Library by his widow, Josephine Ann Bickel, who donated his office files, and his editor, Jeannette Hopkins, who contributed her Bickel correspondence and drafts of <title render="italic">
                     The Morality of Consent

               <p>There are four series in this addition: Correspondence, Writings and Teaching, Personal Papers, and Oral Histories and Photographs. They document Alexander Mordecai Bickel's earliest years, including aspects of his childhood in Romania and the Bronx, his years at the City College of New York, and his service as a combat soldier in the United States Army during World War II. Unlike the main accession of the Bickel Papers, which primarily documents his professional career, this addition contains many photographs and other materials that shed light on Bickel's personal life.</p>
               <p>The Correspondence Series contains the richest materials in this addition, and fills a number of gaps in the main body of the Bickel Papers, especially Alexander M. Bickel's relationship to his parents, Shlomo and Yetta Bickel. A significant portion of the correspondence between Bickel and his parents is in Yiddish. Bickel's frequent correspondence (especially during his days in the military) with his parents declined in the late 1950s and was largely taken on by his wife, Joanne Bickel, beginning in the early 1960s. In these letters, Bickel often jotted a few personal lines. There are also many hundreds of condolence letters that were sent to Joanne Bickel and to the Yale Law School upon Bickel's death, as well as correspondence related to various obituaries and tributes. This correspondence from colleagues, students, and a wide variety of dignitaries from the educational, legal, judicial, and political worlds speaks to Bickel's significant influence. The series is arranged alphabetically. Included among these tributes to Bickel is an audio tape made by Professor Charles L. Black, Jr. of the Yale Law School and his son, Gavin B. Black.</p>

                  <p>The series contains shorter writings; materials relating to two of Bickel's books; and teaching files. Shorter writings contains what appear to be some of Bickel's earliest writings, dating back to his teenage years, and is arranged chronologically. Included are some unpublished stories, as well as newspaper and literary magazine pieces published while he was still a student at Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx. There are also articles written by Bickel for a variety of Jewish and Zionist journals.</p>
                  <p>Books is largely composed of reviews and correspondence related to Bickel's monograph, <emph render="italic">The Morality of Consent,</emph> posthumously published by the Yale University Press. There is extensive correspondence between Joanne Bickel; the book's editor, Jeanette Hopkins; and Yale University Press, particularly its director, Chester Kerr. In addition, there is correspondence from many others involved in the completion, publication, and promotion of the book, including Robert H. Bork, Bickel's colleague at the Yale Law School, Gilbert A. Harrison, of <emph render="italic">The New Republic</emph>, and Norman Podhoretz, of <emph render="italic">Commentary</emph>. There is also one folder on a book that Bickel undertook as part of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise. This volume was nearly finished when Bickel died in 1974, and was to be completed shortly thereafter by Benno C. Schmidt, Jr., Bickel's former student at the Yale Law School. The correspondence contained in this folder, including letters from Paul A. Freund and Stanley N. Katz, documents the completion of this work, finally published in 1984 as <emph render="italic">The Judiciary and Responsible Government</emph>, 1910-1921.</p>
                  <p>Teaching files contains a variety of materials related to Bickel's teaching of two courses at the Yale Law School. Included are handwritten and typed notes on cases and subjects, questions to ask students in class, and announcements of assignments.</p>

                  <p>The series is arranged by type of material: appointment books; diaries; memorabilia; military papers; and student papers. Appointment books document Bickel's daily travels, meetings, personal contacts, and other activities, whereas the diaries are filled with Bickel's personal thoughts and reflections, as well as selections from his favorite poems and passages. The diary entries begin in April 1941, during Bickel' s first year as a student at the City College of New York. He recounts his classes and teachers, as well as ideas for newspaper articles, short stories, plays, and novels. This first diary is identified in Bickel's hand on the inside cover as "Volume III," implying the creation of earlier volumes. There are no earlier volumes, however, in the addition. Later diaries document Bickel's years in the United States Army and at the Harvard Law School, although over time the entries begin to diminish in number and depth. Of most significance in the military papers are security questionnaires completed by Bickel while he was serving under John J. McCloy and Robert R. Bowie, and a detailed memorandum written by Bickel discussing one of these security interviews in May 1954. In these materials, Bickel details his membership in various organizations, and also speaks to his political leanings at the time. Bickel took copious notes as a student at the City College of New York. He preserved his notes from many courses, including economics, history, legal history, and sociology, as well as papers written on Judah P. Benjamin, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Nazism, Daniel Webster, and world federalism.</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>The oral history section of this series contains transcripts and tapes. The series also contains a wide of variety of photographs of Bickel at many stages of his life, which are valuable because there are so few photographs of Bickel or others elsewhere in the papers.</p>
                  <p>Bickel undertook a succession of oral history interviews near the end of his life. The first interview was conducted by Edna G. Rostow in 1973, under the auspices of the William E. Wiener Oral History Library of the American Jewish Committee. Only the uncorrected transcript is contained here. The subjects covered include Bickel's childhood, his days at the Harvard Law School, his early interest in studying history, his Jewish identity, his early attempts at finding, getting, and then rejecting a job at a law firm in New York, and his feelings about such figures as Felix Frankfurter, Paul A. Freund and Erwin N. Griswold of the Harvard Law School, and Abe Fortas and Harry Shulman of the Yale Law School. The beginning of this oral history is a transcription and then appears to become a summary.</p>
                  <p>The second oral history interview was conducted by Yale University's Stanley Flink, apparently in early 1974. Only the uncorrected transcript is contained here. The subjects covered include the Watergate scandal, Felix Frankfurter, interaction between members of the Supreme Court and the political branches of government, and Bickel's service under John J. McCloy and Robert R. Bowie in the State Department.</p>
                  <p>Maggie Scarf conducted the last and most extensive interview, which began in October 1974 and ended on 4 November 1974, just three days before Bickel's death. The interview ranges widely over the major and minor events of Bickel's life, from his earliest memories and family history, to his impending death. There is also a file of correspondence relating to the controversial disposition of these tapes, transcripts, and the articles or books that were to come from them. Both of the major journals for which Bickel wrote, the generally politically conservative <emph render="italic">Commentary</emph>, and the generally liberal <emph render="italic">The New Republic</emph>, wanted to publish these materials, but neither appear to have done so. These files document the struggle between those journals and their editors to claim Bickel's memory for their own. Joanne Bickel also did an interview with Maggie Scarf in the days after her husband's death. Bickel discusses her husband's final days, his funeral, and its aftermath.</p>
