         <p>Herbert Warren Wind graduated from Yale in 1937 and pursued a career in writing and journalism, becoming an authority on the game of golf. Wind authored numerous golf books, most notably The Story of American Golf (1948). As a journalist, Wind was the first golf editor for Sports Illustrated from 1954 to 1960 and later wrote sports articles and general profiles for The New Yorker. Wind was also involved in televising golf during the 1960s, and he taught a seminar on sports writing at Yale during the 1970s. In 1995, Wind received the United States Golf Association's highest honor, the Bob Jones Award.</p>
