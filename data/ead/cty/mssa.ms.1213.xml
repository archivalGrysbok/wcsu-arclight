         <p>TALCOTT HUNTINGTON RUSSELL, B.A. 1869
Born March 14, 1847, in New Haven, Conn.; Died October 19, 1917, in Westport, Conn.
Talcott Huntington Russell was born in New Haven, Conn., March 14, 1847. He was the son of
General William Huntington Russell and Mary Elizabeth (Hubbard) Russell. His father, a graduate
of the College in 1833 and of the School of Medicine in 1838, was the founder of the well-known
Collegiate and Commercial Institute in New Haven. He was the son of Matthew Talcott Russell
(B.A. 1779) and Mary (Huntington) Russell and a grandson of Rev. Enoch Huntington (B.A. 1759),
who was for twenty-eight years a Fellow of Yale College, from 1788 to 1793 being secretary of the
Corporation. Noadiah Russell, one of the founders of the College, was an ancestor. Mrs. Russell
was the daughter of Thomas Hubbard (Honorary M.D. 1818), at one time professor of surgery at Yale.</p>
         <p>He received his preparatory training at his father's school and at the Lawrence Academy, Groton,
Mass. After graduation from Yale he studied for one year in the Yale School of Law, and then
entered the Columbia Law School, from which he received the degree of LL.B. in 1872. He was
admitted to the bar of Connecticut in that year, and afterwards practiced in New Haven, retiring in
1914. He was at one time a member of the New Haven Board of Councilmen, being for one year its
president. In 1878 he was appointed receiver of the American Mutual Life Insurance Company. In
1884 he became secretary of the Independent Republican Organization. From 1892 until 1900 he
was instructor on municipal corporations in the Yale School of Law. He was for a number of years
treasurer of the Conference on Uniform State Laws, of which body he was one of the first members,
and chairman of the Committee on Commercial Law. In 1911 he was retianed by the legislative
committee on a system of compensation for industrial injuries, to prepare a draft of a bill which
formed the framework of much of the legislation finally adopted. He was named as first member of
the commission created to investigate the general subject of state insurance for workmen. In 1913,
when Connecticut adopted the workmen's compensation system, he was made chairman of the
board and commissioner for the third Congressional district. On account of ill health, he was forced
to resign after a year and a half of service.</p>
         <p>Mr. Russell died in Westport, Conn., October 19, 1917, after an illness of four years. Interment was
in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.</p>
         <p>He was married December 10, 1889, in New Haven, to Geraldine Whittemore, daughter of Captain
William W. Low, U. S. N. and Evelina (Peck) Low. She survives him with their two sons, Philip
Gray Russell (B.A. 1913) and William Low Russell, a member of the Class of 1920. He was a
brother of Thomas Hubbard Russell, '72S., Philip Gray Russell, '76, and Edward Hubbard Russell,
'78S.
