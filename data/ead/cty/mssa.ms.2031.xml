         <p>Rabbi Shemuel Kaufman, son of Rebbe Avraham David of Myropil (Wołyń or Volhynia, Ukraine), succeeded his father as Rebbe of the Kaminka-Myropil Hasidim. The family was known as Me-Rabenu, tracing their genealogy to Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi. A notable forbear was Kaufman's grandfather, the Hasidic sage Shemuel Kaminker (circa 1878-1943), who was known in local legends as an exorcist of dybbuks (the soul of a dead person embedded in that of a living person) and may even have served as An-sky's model for the character Rebbe Azriel of Miropol in his play, The Dybbuk. In 1923 Rebbe Shemuel Kaufman immigrated to the United States. In New York he became known as "The Tzaddik of Myropil."  Most of his writings remained in Russia and were lost. Some of his novellae were printed in the periodical "Pardes" and in his book "Tiferet Shemuel," published in New York in 1926. In 1996 his grandson published Tiferet Shemuel, part 2, including many of the texts found in this collection in the original manuscript form. Kaufman's son Moshe did not assume the role of rebbe, leaving Shemuel ben Avraham David Kaufman as the last Rebbe of the Kaminka-Myropil dynasty. He died in 1938.</p>
