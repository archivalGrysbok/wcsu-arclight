         <p>Gene's wife, who received her B.A. at the University of Connecticut in 1937, works with him in public relations, acts as asst. director of public relations for Southern Connecticut State College and in other public relations capacities. She is also collaborating with him on a biography of Leo Szilard, scientist, to be published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. A former social worker she is past president and board member of the New Haven Board of Welfare, a former board member of the New Haven Community Council, a board member of the New Haven Family Service, and a member of the budget committee of the New Haven Family Service, and a member of the budget committee of United Fund of Greater New Haven. Their son, Alley Jay, now in the Class of '66 at Yale where he is majoring in history, was an AIESEC trainee in Dublin in the summer of 1955 and has been an asst. scoutmaster in New Haven, and has worked in the officer of Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania, and in the Second National Bank in New Haven. Carolyn Willa, a sophomore at Day Prospect Hill School in New Haven, is on the editorial board of the school newspaper, an honor student, and interested in dramatics. Gene's relaxation comes through travel, occasional golf, reading, and writing.</p>
         <p>He writes, "Dear Yalies: With a career in writing and public relations which started at Yale, a son at Yale, and a brother on its staff, I feel as though I have never left the stimulating and rewarding atmosphere of the university. If anything, I would like to pay tribute to William C. DeVane, the gentle scholar, the man of wisdom, who meant so much to me personally, and to my wife, who worked while I struggled through college and has never ceased to be my inspiration, and to my two children who have never ceased to mystify, delight and confuse as well as amuse us. If I have made any small contribution, it has been to aid the public understanding of science. I feel privileged to be a liberal arts man loose in the scientific world, helping to report advances in our 20th century technological civilization and acting as a bridge between the man in the laboratory and the citizen whose life is so affected by science."</p>
