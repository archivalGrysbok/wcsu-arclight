         <p>The American Social Science Association Records consist of organizational papers, minutes, correspondence, financial records, and committee files, which document the history of the American Social Science Association from its founding in 1865 through the first twenty-five years of its existence. The files are an incomplete record of the period but highlight the work of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn as secretary of the association and active member of many committees. The records also include files relating to other social science organizations, in which Sanborn was active. The most numerous of these files is for the Conference of Charities and Corrections.</p>
         <p>The Manuscripts and Archives Department received the records from the Yale University Law School in 1989, after Morris Cohen, the Yale Law Librarian, found them in a trunk in the Law School basement. How the records came to be in the Law School's keeping is not entirely clear. It appears that at its demise at least some of the ASSA library was deposited in the Yale Law School. It is possible that Simeon E. Baldwin, who had for some years been a leader of the association, played some role in this deposit. The records of the association came as part of the library, but unlike the printed volumes in the library, the records were left uncatalogued.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The American Social Science Association (ASSA) was founded in Boston in 1865. Through a letter circulated by the Massachusetts Board of Charities, prominent social reformers and intellectuals were asked to form an American organization, similar to the British Social Science Association, to understand and improve a rapidly changing society. As the circular explained, the society would discuss "those questions relating to the Sanitary Condition of the people, the Relief, Employment and Education of the Poor, the Prevention of Crime, the Amelioration of the Criminal Law, the Discipline of Prisons, the Remedial Treatment of the Insane, and those numerous matters of statistical and philanthropic interest which are included under the general head of 'social science.'" At its first meeting the association adopted a constitution and elected William Barton Rogers as president. Franklin Benjamin Sanborn served as secretary.</p>
         <p>The association structured itself in four departments: Education; Public Health; Jurisprudence; and Economy, Trade and Finance. The latter department would later be split into the Department of Social Economy and the Finance Department. The leadership of the departments was built on existing professional specializations; doctors chaired Health, lawyers led Jurisprudence, and college professors took charge of Education.</p>
         <p>The association expected its members, professionals along with humanitarian reformers and businessmen, "to collect all facts, diffuse all knowledge, and stimulate all inquiry, which have a bearing on social welfare." Members were to meet together regularly to read papers and discuss social economics and the means to human improvement. Members presented their papers at large general meetings; the association published several of these papers; and meetings received detailed coverage in the local press.</p>
         <p>In 1868 the association's executive committee appointed Henry Villard as permanent secretary. In 1870 Villard resigned from the post, leaving the association with no permanent secretary and consequently no effective leadership. The association even discussed disbanding. Then in October, 1873, the board named Sanborn permanent secretary and the association began to revive. Under Sanborn, the ASSA forged a link with the National Conference of Charities and Corrections (NCCC), and the two organizations continued to meet together for a decade.</p>
         <p>The very broad base membership of the ASSA led to tensions which would eventually split the association. The delegates to the NCCC were interested in practical solutions to the problems of the poor, the insane, and the criminal classes. They found the papers presented by academics within the ASSA to be too theoretical and abstract. At one time the ASSA executive committee discussed a plan to merge the association with Johns Hopkins University, by which academic inquirers would gain a viable framework for organizing their disciplines. This plan did not gain approval, and in the meantime academic specialists began to form their own associations in their fields of social science. The American Historical Association was formed in 1884; they met with the ASSA but refused to organize as a subordinate department in the ASSA. In 1885 economists formed the American Economic Association followed in 1903 by the American Political Science Association and in 1905 by the American Sociological Society.</p>
         <p>After a period of comparative financial security in the 1880s, the association faced financial hard times in the 1890s. Its members were drifting to other more specialized organizations and its role or purpose was not clear. By 1908 the association was unable to marshal the strength to hold its annual meeting.</p>
         <p>The association is the subject of Thomas L. Haskell's monograph <title render="italic">
               The Emergence of Professional Social Science: the American Social Science Association and the Nineteenth-Century Crisis of Authority
            </title>. Those desiring a more detailed history of the ASSA should refer to this volume (University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, 1977).</p>

         <head>Arrangement</head>
         <p>The records are arranged in two series: Series I. Association records, 1863-1906. Series II. Related associations records, 1865-1889.</p>
         <p>Series I includes the records of the American Social Science Association, while Series II is composed of material of other social science organizations. Materials in both series appear to have been in the possession of Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. Materials in Series I seem to have come into Sanborn's care, when he was secretary of the ASSA. One cannot be certain that materials in Series II have any relation to the ASSA material in Series I. In the case of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections there is an obvious link between it and the ASSA. For any other organization there may be no other connection than the fact that Franklin Benjamin Sanborn was active in it.</p>

               <p>Series I begins with surviving records of the ASSA's annual and general meetings. This arrangement places records of the first annual meeting, including the invitation to meet, response to the invitation, proceedings, and clippings from the founding meeting at the very beginning of the records. For other meetings, the files in the series may include copies of papers read at meetings, correspondence relating to arrangements for the meeting, and newspaper clippings describing the proceedings.</p>
               <p>General correspondence follows the records of meetings. Most letters are incoming and are from members, as well as public school, prison and health administrators, state legislators, and other city and state officers. The letters are, for the most part, addressed to the association secretary but are occasionally addressed to other ASSA officers. The letters include responses to invitations to join the ASSA or to provide a paper for a meeting, requests for ASSA literature, orders for proceedings, or reactions to organizational policies. Since the association solicited members from such a broad base, the files contain letters from some of the most prominent individuals of the age including at least single letters from Lyman Abbott, Henry Adams, C. Loring Brace, Charles W. Eliot, George Washington Cable, Melville Dewey, E. M. Gallaudet, James A. Garfield, Daniel Coit Gilman, E. L. Godkin, Washington Gladden, Rutherford B. Hays, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Julia Ward Howe, Frederick Law Olmstead, Josiah Quincy, Theodore Roosevelt, Carl Schurz, Lewis Tappan, and Frances Willard.</p>
               <p>The earliest correspondence (1865-1869) is arranged alphabetically in file folders by correspondent name. For the period 1870-1871, there are incomplete letterbooks of alphabetically arranged incoming letters, in addition to one folder of loose correspondence. There is also a letterbook containing copies of outgoing letters in chronological order for 1869-1870.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the general correspondence is unbound and is arranged alphabetically by correspondent name. Most incoming letters are addressed to Sanborn. Though this correspondence spans the period 1873-1885, it is fragmentary. There are, for instance, few letters from 1875, and the period from 1880-1884 is not documented. Correspondents represented in the records by five or more letters are listed in the finding aid. These correspondents are normally active association members and officers such as James Barnard, Gamaliel Bradford, David Francis Lincoln, Henry Villard, David Wells, and Francis Wayland.</p>
               <p>The general correspondence is followed by records of various officers. In this section are found minutes of executive committee meetings; the secretary's reports and papers; treasurer's records, including correspondence on membership and financial matters, accounts and vouchers, and lists of members and journal subscribers; and librarian's records consisting of lists of library holdings and records of the library's transfer to the Yale Law School.</p>
               <p>The series includes some records from each of the ASSA's individual departments. These records include correspondence relating to a department's work, minutes of meetings, annual reports, and topical files containing clippings and research material on subjects studied by the department. The records of the Health Department also include entries for an essay contest sponsored by the department. At the end of the series there are two folders containing publications of the ASSA.</p>
               <p>The records in this series are arranged in five sections: Annual/general meetings; General correspondence; Officers' records; Departmental records; and Publications.</p>

               <p>Series includes records for the Boston Social Science Association, the British Association for the Promotion of Social Science, the Conference of Charities and Correction, and the Boston Branch of the National Anti-Inflation League. For all but the Conference of Charities and Correction, these associations are each represented in the records by a single folder, which may contain scattered minutes, correspondence, and printed material. For the Conference of Charities and Corrections, however, the records include several folders of correspondence, mainly between Sanborn and individuals affiliated with state boards of charity. The correspondence is again fragmentary, with the most substantial correspondence dating from 1873-1878 and from 1886-1887. These records are generally concerned with arrangements for the conference's meetings, papers to be delivered, and orders and payment for meeting proceedings.</p>
               <p>The records in this series are arranged in alphabetical order by association name.</p>
