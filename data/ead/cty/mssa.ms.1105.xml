         <p>These papers consist of a typewritten manuscript, "Bill and His Home," recounting Elliott Dunlap Smith's seven-month experience in the home of Mrs. French Vanderbilt as tutor to her eleven-year-old son, William Henry Vanderbilt, III, later governor of Rhode Island. Smith provides a vivid picture of the "poor little rich boy's" life in Newport and during an extended visit to Cannes. A note by Smith written in 1938 accompanies the manuscript, and explains that the account is based upon letters written by Smith to his mother at the time the events he describes were occurring.</p>
