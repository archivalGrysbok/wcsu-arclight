         <p>Henry Sherman, who died in Washington, D. C., March 28, 1879, was the third son of Josiah and Hannah (Jones) Sherman, of Albany, N. Y., where he was born March 6, 1808.</p>
         <p>He spent a part of the first year after graduation in the Princeton (N. J.) Theological Seminary, and then took up the study of law in the Yale Law School, returning in 1832 to his home in Albany, and there entering his profession. He soon removed to New York City, and while practicing there published in 1841 a "Digest of the Law of Marine Insurance," which ran through several editions. In 1843 he also published a "Governmental History of the U.S.," for use in schools. In 1850 he removed to Hartford, Conn., and there published (1858) a work on slavery and (1860) an enlarged edition of his History. In 1861 he removed to Washington, and was employed until 1868 in connection with one of the bureaus of the Treasury Department. In 1868 he resumed the practice of his profession in Washington, in which he continued until his death (which occurred, after a three weeks' illness, from erysipelas), being at that time of the law firm of Sherman &amp; Atlee. Mr. Sherman was a personal friend of President Lincoln, who on the morning before his assassination tendered him the Chief Justiceship of the Territory of New Mexico, his commission was afterwards sent him by President Johnson, but he resigned the office very soon.</p>
         <p>He was married, Sept. 20, 1843, to Miss Anna Amelia, daughter of Michael Burnham, Esq., publisher of the New York Evening Post. She survives him with three of their five children.</p>

"The scraps were collected by Miss Anna Mary Mandall of Albany, now Mrs. Robert Minturn of New York. She presented them to me about a fortnight before she was married, on condition that I have them neatly pasted in 'a Scrap Book', to which I assented and received them. Some months after, I became acquainted with Miss Mary Camp, a beautiful 'girl of sixteen,' at Albany from Sackett's Harbour. She requested me to write a piece of original Poetry in the Album. I consented on condition that she would paste 'some scraps' I had in a book for me, to which she promised &amp; thus I secured the fulfillment of my engagement with my fair friend and the donor of them. So this volume commemorates the kindness of two female friends." [Signed] Henry Sherman.</unittitle>
