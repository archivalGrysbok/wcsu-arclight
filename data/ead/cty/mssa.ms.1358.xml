         <p>The Marble-Richardson Family Papers are contained in one box and consist of two volumes of family genealogy and two folders of loose materials removed from the volumes. The Papers were acquired by Yale University in 1979.</p>
         <p>The genealogies and other family papers were lovingly compiled by Arthur Demerick Marble (1853-1934), a civil engineer from Lawrence, Massachusetts, between 1895 and around 1916. Volume I, <title render="italic">
               Genealogy Marble-Richardson
            </title>, is devoted to the ancestors of Arthur D. Marble. It includes family charts, pictures and drawings, newspaper clippings, biographical sketches and reminiscences, letters, copies of diaries and legal documents, and a variety of original documents.The Marbles, Richardsons, and other families represented were all from Massachusetts, mostly from the Hingham area. The Marble ancestors most completely documented are Gershom Marble (ca. 1662-1725) and Demerick Marble (1819-1898). Volume I also contains information on six other male lines; Gross, Burr, Leavitt, Howland, Gorham, and Easterbrooks, the first two being the most important. In each instance, the direct line only is discussed. For example, seven generations of Grosses are included, ending with Deborah Hawkes Gross, the mother Arthur D. Marble. The Burr family material contains information on six generations of Burrs, concluding with Olive Fearing Burr, the grandmother of Arthur D. Marble. The Burr record has copies of several diaries kept by Thomas Burr (1735-1821) from the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars.</p>
         <p>Volume II, <title render="italic">
               Geneaology
            </title> (sic) <title render="italic">
               Richardson-Marble
            </title>, contains materials on eight family lines of Mary Alice Richardson (1850-1914), the wife of Arthur D. Marble, and fourteen additional Marble lines.
The Richardson section includes a biographical sketch of Mary Alice Richardson and twenty letters to and from Abijah Richardson, Jr. (1825- ) and Frances Maria (Manning) Richardson (1826- ), Mary Alice's parents, between 1848 and 1856. In 1851 Abijah Richardson, Jr. abandoned his wife and children and travelled to San Francisco, where he remained for at least five years in an unsuccessful quest for riches. The letters, however, are of more interest to those studying the Richardson family than for those interested in early California history, for they contain relatively little about life and conditions in San Francisco. The other female lines included are those for Pond, Fairbanks, Manning, Wright, Locke, and Burnham. The three most important additional Marble lines are those for the Hawkes, Fearing, and Lewis families. The Hawkes record contains a document from the 1690s giving information about the first three generations of the family. A Fearing manuscript from the mid-nineteenth century has material on seven generations of that family, while the Lewis section includes a letter from John Lewis (1717-1803) of North Yarmouth, Maine to his parents in Hingham, Massachusetts, written March 6 1746/1747. Lewis discusses the winter weather, wood cutting, and the purchase of sable skins for a muff for his sister. A Lewis family genealogy dating from 1809 is also included.</p>
         <p>Folders 3 and 4 contain loose items removed from the two volumes, some of which were inserted after the death of Arthur D. Marble. The material has been kept in the same order as it appeared in the original volumes.</p>
         <p>The Marble-Richardson Family Papers are most useful to genealogists, but copies of eighteenth century diaries, family biographies, and the California letters might also be of interest to researchers.</p>
