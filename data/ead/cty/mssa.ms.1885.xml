         <p>Balmori Associates is an urban and landscape design firm in New York City founded by Diana Balmori (1932-2016) in 1990. Balmori Associates is recognized for their interfacing between landscape and architecture. Through research, collaboration and innovation, Balmori Associates is looking to explore and expand the boundaries between nature and structure.  Their approach to developing public spaces is rooted in design ideas, coupled with an understanding of environmental, social and physical needs. Their application of innovative designs to the study of the social functions of green roofs, floating islands and temporary landscapes has created a signature and functional aesthetic establishing them as leaders in the field of urban design and the creation of new forms of public space.</p>

                     <p>Project statement: The design of the Frances K. Fergusson Courtyard serves to anchor three buildings in a nondescript amorphous space and to give the students from the new Drama School a place to gather, to watch a performance or a film, or to just hang out.</p>
                     <p>The rectangular courtyard, 80 by 140 feet, is sunken 1.5 feet into the earth. The inner surface is sodded, and the concrete wall around the perimeter clad in copper. The copper has since turned brown, now resembling the color of the earth. Gradually it will tarnish to green and feel closer to the grass on the surface of the bottom of the space. A ramp leads down into the space from each end of the rectangle. Students perch along the comfortable edge as on a bench. The space has become especially popular on winter days, when the southern side of the courtyard receives sun late into the afternoon. The three surrounding buildings feel anchored by the space. A Breuer designed dormitory sits on one of the long sides of the rectangle. On the opposite side of the rectangle, an evergreen hedge, which will be shaped over time, shields the courtyard from a view of the lower service area. The hedge also serves to protect the courtyard from north winds. LED lights create a soft glow in the courtyard at night, also serving to make the edge of the courtyard visible.</p>

                     <p>Project Statement: The two open spaces on this project--the Briarcombe Sculpture Courtyard and the Hildegarde Krause Baker Sculpture Garden--were designed for the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. The Briarcombe Sculpture Courtyard is a small, graveled courtyard beside the long glassed-in gallery walk to the museum. This area is used for sculpture exhibits. By the side of the museum, the Hildegarde Krause Baker Sculpture Garden was created to become a sculpture garden over time, its surrounding walls enclosing a gigantic, tricolor beech tree, which was left in place to be a jewel in the pathway of the garden. The center island contains dark planting material, the outer planting beds light colored material. Screens of wisteria and clematis vines shield the approach to the garden. The forecourt to the garden, where large sculptures can be exhibited, is partially paved in brick. This space is marked by three screens, which create a backdrop for the sculpture before them. The screens also create a barrier to keep the eye from traveling beyond the sculpture. Two slots cut out between the three screens allow a view of the back wall and the beech tree. The darker background of the back wall also separates the forecourt from the garden itself.</p>
                     <p>Balmori's design team included Peter Viteretto, Christopher Siefert, Robert Milchrest and Martha Burgess. The architect of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center was Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates.</p>
                     <p>Entry and Sculpture Courtyards: 2,900 square feet.</p>
                     <p>Sculpture Garden: 8,600 square feet.</p>
                     <p>The project was completed in 1994.</p>

                  <p>Project description: Eleven international teams of artists, architects and landscape architects were invited to submit designs for a memorial fountain for Princess Diana by the Serpentine Stream in Hyde Park, London, England. In addition to Diana Balmori, they were: Zaha Hadid; Anish Kapoor and Future Systems; Kathryn Gustafson (the only other landscape architect); Tony Fretton; Terry Farrell; William Pye; Rik Nys; Julian Opie; Adam Carouso and Peter St. John; Tom Lonsdale and Thomas Heatherwick. The jury consisted primarily of art curators with one representative from the Parks Department. The panel chose three finalists: Balmori, Gustafson, and Kapoor. After three months of deliberation, the jurists were unable to come to an agreement. Britain's Cultural Secretary, Tessa Jowell, intervened to resolve the impasse, awarding the project to Gustafson.</p>
                  <p>In December 2001, Balmori spent a week at the site formulating a basic scheme and creating a series of hand drawings, which included sketches made on site. Balmori's design team included Paul Butkus, Adrienne Cortez, Julie Farris, Javier Gonzalez, Nathan Howe, Cecilia B. Martinic and Mark Thomann. In addition, the group worked with an English landscape architect and ecologist, Andrew Grant, who provided expertise on mosses. Other partners on the project included Long &amp; Kentish (architects); Patrick Bellow/Atelier 10 (green systems/hydrology); and Sam Price (structural engineer). The scheme consisted of a fountain in the Serpentine, where a surface of still water would be surrounded by moving water. The different qualities of the two waters would create a dramatic contrast: the still water surface glassy, reflective; the other surface broken by the water's motion. The fountain would be fed from Serpentine water used for irrigating plants and moss on the hills surrounding the stream and returned to the fountain after being cleaned en route by the plants. The water would be cleaned en route to the fountain. This component of Balmori's design observed Princess Diana's concern for the environment, enacting, in a sense, a rite of purification of the Serpentine.</p>

                  <head>General</head>
                  <p>Project description: The project for the roof of the Silvercup Studios in Long Island City emerged from a proposal Diana Balmori submitted to the Long Island City Business Development Corporation (LICBDC) in Long Island City, Queens, in 2002 for greening the neighborhood, given its renown as the "asthma corridor." Directly beside the Queensboro Bridge (to Manhattan), Silvercup is situated in the worst section of this polluted district. Balmori and her team (which included Sarah Wayland-Smith and Mark Thomann) saw an opportunity to use Long Island City's many large, flat-roofed buildings-known as "pancake buildings"-calculating that if all of these surfaces were made "green," the area would be 667 acres, approximately the size of Brooklyn's Prospect Park.</p>
                  <p>The first to express interest in the green roof project were the owners of a high-end furniture fabrication shop, Donald Gratz, and his wife, the urban critic and writer, Roberta Brandes Gratz. The shop is also located right next to the Queensboro Bridge. The green roof proposal also sparked the interest of the president of Silvercup Studios, Stuart Match Suna. Suna suggested that Balmori, with Silvercup, seek funding from green-oriented institutions. After more than a year, the group was awarded a $500,000 grant from Clean Air Communities, a non-profit organization devoted to reducing air pollution and increasing energy efficiency in New York City. Silvercup furnished engineering and architectural services, and Balmori Associates designed the green roof using a modular system to cover over 35,000 square feet of roof space on top of Studios X, B and 4.</p>
                  <p>The plantings of different types and varieties of sedums on Silvercup's non-accessible roofs were purposefully selected for their color contrast to provide greater visibility from the Queensboro Bridge and from its on/off ramps on the Queens side. Cloth strips of brilliant colors were added as another way to increase the roofs' visibility. Such a high profile location has had the added benefit of letting the project serve as an advertisement for green roofs in general. Unfortunately, due to scheduling issues at Silvercup, the planting could only occur in August 2005, a month ill-suited for planting. The sedums were planted as 2-inch plugs, and by the summer of 2006, the roof was approximately 80% covered.</p>

                  <head>General</head>
                  <p>Project description: The intent of our St. Louis Riverfront design is to create a vibrant, innovative riverfront with strong connections to the Arch site, to the city of St. Louis and to the Mississippi River. After Diana Balmori presented four possible schemes, the client, Great Rivers Greenway, chose the fourth and most ambitious of the schemes: Terraces and Islands. This scheme called for a cluster of floating islands on the Mississippi River with programmatic features such as restaurants, support facilities, and a possible natural history pavilion on the islands. The riverfront is terraced with several levels of pedestrian paths and places to sit and relax. At high water levels, when the lower terraces are submerged, the floating islands will rise with the water and still be accessible from pontoon walkways. This scheme exploits the dynamism of the shifting water levels and maintains accessibility to the river as it fluctuates.</p>
                  <p>The waterfront development will occur in two phases. Phase I will focus on the 3/4-mile stretch between the Eads and Poplar Street bridges. The area will be bound by Leonor K. Sullivan Boulevard on the west; by the middle of the Mississippi River on the east; by Biddle Street on the north; and by Chouteau Avenue on the south. Phase II moves on to an adjacent 3/4 mile stretch. The project area is in two sections of Leonor K. Sullivan Boulevard and the riverfront. The northern section is bound by Eads Bridge north to Biddle Street. The southern section is bound by Poplar Street Bridge south to Chouteau Avenue.</p>
                  <p>Four principles guide the design of the St. Louis Riverfront:</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph render="bold">Experience the nature and presence of the river</emph>. This first principle is derived from the site's location on the Mississippi River. Above all else, the idea is to offer as many ways as possible in which the public can experience and interact with the water along this channeled waterfront. The potential for edge treatments, layers and platforms that expose the phenomena of the river's flow at the various water levels are the secret to a successful design experience. Creating experiences will initiate interaction with the river and define it as a place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph render="bold">Create new connections</emph>. The second principle involves the identification of all connections from physical, visual, social and temporal perspectives. Physical connections include the Eads Bridge, Downtown St. Louis, the Arch Grounds, Laclede's Landing, Chouteau's Landing and the Greenways comprising the River Ring. Visually, the design should directly link to the river back to Downtown and to the Arch as it frames westward views and back to the east. Socially, connections must include as many constituencies as possible for true community redevelopment. Temporal connections should be based on research of historical elements and events, current events, future development and the daily and seasonal fluctuations of the landscape and the river.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph render="bold">Develop new spaces</emph>. The third principle understands that different physical spaces and transportation modes can uncover new functions and opportunities for the riverfront. The bridges and river could offer new means of water transportation and pedestrian crossings by way of the Eads Bridge or public excursion boats. These new spaces and transportation modes are examples of strategies that will provide a more accessible waterfront - while animating it with life and activity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph render="bold">Complement the City</emph>. The last principle implies that design should enhance what is already happening within the city, not compete with it. Many will feel that the design should provide a unique contrast to the arch grounds or that the riverfront should be an extension of the arch grounds itself to the water. The design process will determine this direction. The design idea is that the site is urban and is a part of revitalizing downtown. Urban design connections from the riverfront to the city are a necessary step in complementing the two.</p>
                  <p>Budget constraints and permitting reduced the number of islands. These ecologically and aesthetically important islands create habitat and green space on a hard edged waterfront which endures a 40-foot fluctuation in water levels with strong currents carrying large-scale debris. In addition to the remaining islands, floating triangular vegetation mats will populate the two bays created in the space between the southern docks and terraces. These mats, like the floating islands, serve both ecological and aesthetic purposes. The mats can be colonized with specialized microbes that help clean the water, and the roots of the plants growing on the mats are valuable food for fish and other aquatic animals. The vegetation itself is habitat for birds and insects. Aesthetically, the Triangle Islands are another means of bringing life to the edge of the terraces. The diversity of plant life on the Triangular Islands will also be an important education tool for the ecological learning center on the southern terraces. Programmatic elements originally developed for the islands are shifted to land and will be organized into five nodes, creating centers of activity separated by contemplative landscape spaces.</p>
                  <p>To avoid problems with river debris associated with structures anchored in the water, the terraces will be cantilevered, a 'feat of engineering' reminiscent of the ingenuity of the arch design and construction. The terraces will be made of a self supporting mesh, a structure without visible structural support. This will allow the surface to be transparent and prevent the lower space from becoming dark and unwelcoming. Additionally the structure must be able to withstand yearly flooding.</p>
                  <p>Three bridges on the site will expand the experience of the river front by allowing visitors to walk over the river. These structures are also to be beautifully engineered. The pedestrian bridge to the north will take the profile of the arch and have a stainless steel underside with decking on the surface.</p>

                     <p>2012 marks the completion of Balmori Associates' Master Plan for Abandoibarra. For the past twenty years, Bilbao has reinvented itself by regenerating important sections of the city affected by the industrial crisis of the 1980's.  One of those former industrial areas is a derelict harbor in the center of Bilbao called Abandoibarra.</p>
                     <p>The Abandoibarra Master Plan was drawn by Balmori Associates, Cesar Pelli and Eugenio Aguinaga in 1998 (winner of an international competition). Balmori Associates created park guidelines and designed all open space, streets, sidewalks and plazas, placing emphasis on expanding the amount of green space in the city and incorporating sustainable design practices. Two-thirds of the Master Plan area are dedicated to parks and open space.</p>
                     <p>Today, what was once a high-speed roadway, has been turned into a boulevard with multiple pedestrian crossings and a light rail now connects the two main cultural centers of the development: Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum and the city's opera house. Running on wide swaths of green lawn, this rail line gives continuity to green space. For the river edge, Balmori proposed a linear park, Parque de la Ribera. This new promenade, no less than thirty meters in width, is treated as a longitudinal space at two levels. The half nearest to the water proposes the pier's rehabilitation, maintaining the existing dialogue between both shores. The inside half, which is located at the 6m level, concurs with the exterior of the Guggenheim Museum. In 2005 this section of the Master Plan received the Special Award 'Città d'Acqua' of the Biennale di Venezia for Best Project. In 2003, Balmori Associates was commissioned the designed of Plaza Euskadi and in 2007, together with RTN Architect, won an international competition to design Campa de los Ingleses Park also located in Abandoibarra.</p>

                     <p>Plaza Euskadi connects the nineteenth century section of the city called "El Ensanche" to the new section of Bilbao, Deusto university campus, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Nervión River. The Plaza is a pivot, unifying diverse elements of the city.  Apart from the Museum of Fine Arts and historic residential buildings, the plaza is surrounded by contemporary buildings such as university and library buildings, a shopping mall, a subway station, hotels, residential buildings, an office skyscraper, designed by different architects including Gehry, Moneo, Pelli, Siza, Krier, Legorreta, and Stern.</p>
                     <p>Oval in form, the plaza has two forms of circulation: a tree-lined perimeter path for leisurely walks and sitting, and a dominant central path which brings the people from downtown to Abandoibarra to the Campa de los Ingleses Park, The Rivers, and the pedestrian bridge crossing the river to Deusto University and its neighborhoods.</p>
                     <p>Three public park "pockets" hook onto the sides of the central path, which provide colorful and playful seating made from recycled rubber. Each pocket has a different character: an amphitheater section with reflection puddles, an ottoman seating section, and a "garden" section of flowering shrubs with a 100 year old Laegostremia tree.</p>
                     <p>In 2008 the construction of the plaza was impacted by the economic downturn in Spain leading to a complete re-design. The final design cost was half of the original construction budget which required the removal of fountains, a more modest planting and grading scheme, and a shift in materials.</p>

                     <p>Campa de los Ingleses Park designed by Balmori Associates with RTN Architect is the result of an international design competition (2007).</p>
                     <p>The park flows from the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum, unifying the Abandoibarra area of Bilbao and the Nervión River. The Park's design was based on gracefully mediating for pedestrians a ten meter (33 feet) elevation difference between the city above and the Nervión River below. This was achieved with ramps, terraces, and topography, earthforms serving to control vistas and to allow for a café to be tucked under.</p>
                     <p>Instead of an "Industrial Lawn", a "Freedom Lawn" was planted by introducing various grass species, clover and wildflowers that fixes nitrogen and reduces the need for pesticides. The paving designed by Balmori contains an additive called GeoSilex® which absorbs CO2; the paving was developed with the University of Granada and made entirely from industrial waste. The local newspaper referred to the park as "a new lung for the city."</p>

                     <p>The winter garden functions as the lobby and reception area of the Iberdrola Tower. To enhance the character of the space, we selected three ancient olive trees. These trees, treated as sculptures, will emerge from a landscape composed by desert flowering plants.</p>
                     <p>The public plaza around the tower has been designed over a submerged parking garage. This roof garden reads as the continuation of the surrounding landscape of the Campa de los Ingleses Park, also designed by Balmori Associates.</p>
                     <p>The tower is LEED certified and all the water arriving to the site will be treated. There is a bioswale surrounding the tower to collect, filter and clean the water arriving to the site.</p>

                     <p>As a member of the jury for the second edition of an International Competition of urban gardens in the city of Bilbao called "Bilbao Jardín 2009", Diana Balmori was invited to create a temporary garden. Balmori, like each of the twenty-five selected participants, was assigned a ten meter by ten meter square in which to design a garden. The site was located at the landing of a large staircase between two Arata Isozaki towers leading to Santiago Calatrava's footbridge over the Nervión River.</p>
                     <p>Instead of remaining at the landing of the stairs Balmori stretched the same hundred square meter surface into a narrow band and shifted the site in order for the garden to climb the stairs. In one broad stroke the garden performed a narrative of landscape which transformed the way this public corridor was perceived by users.  In form, the garden engages the horizontal plaza with the rising vertical plane of the steps and the upright gesture of Eduardo Chillida's sculpture. Like the famous 'Spanish Steps' in Rome, the garden is not only designed for visitors to ascend and descend, but for them to linger.</p>
                     <p>"The Garden That Climbs the Stairs" transformed a space in an unexpected way. It transformed the stairs and the space around them.</p>

                  <p>The Farmington Canal, a 2-mile-long section of railroad in eastern Connecticut, has been abandoned since 1982. A canal that ran three miles through the city of New Haven and six miles through Hamden, a New Haven suburb, preceded the railroad. The masterplan for the Farmington canal reuse was initiated as part of the federal Rails-to-Trails rehabilitation program. Developed by Balmori Associates it sought, through substantial research, to reactivate the canal and transform it into a recreational corridor that connects disparate parts of the city with its center. By modest moves, the canal corridor can eventually affect projects that occur along it, becoming a spine on which to hang other built development.</p>
                  <p>The two mile long Yale owned section sits by the new Engineering Research Building of Yale University, located at the corner of Prospect Street and Trumbull Street. Working together with its design architects, civil and environmental engineers, Balmori Associates explored numerous sustainable design ideas. The porous paving used as part of a larger storm water management strategy reduces runoff's volume and velocity.</p>
                  <p>The section of abandoned railway is envisioned not simply as a trail but a new prototype of public open space, a linear park made up of discrete green segments that respond individually to their respective urban or suburban contexts.</p>

                  <p>For a new development in the suburb of Minneapolis, we proposed a drainage system with a dual purpose: provide drainage for the development of nearly 500 homes and create and function as a public space. Dubbed 'Park Place' by local residents, the 91-acre park has now become an integral part of the community, not only as a part of infrastructure, but also as a public amenity.</p>
                  <p>A series of strategies are used to temporarily store excess water and mitigate the risks of flooding through a swale system, ponds and channels planted with grasses and sedges. It resolves environmentally the issue of frequent flooding in a flat plain-with a high water table and peak storm volumes-emptying in the Red River.</p>
                  <p>The designed riparian system consists of a civic lawn on axis with the downtown area, flanked by playing fields, bike paths and pedestrian paths; glimpses of wildlife are provided by the wetlands associated with this urban waterway.</p>
