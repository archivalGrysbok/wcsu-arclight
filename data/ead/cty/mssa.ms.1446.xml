         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Henry Stuart Hughes was born May 7, 1916 in New York City, the son of Charles Evans Hughes, Jr. and Marjory Stuart Hughes. His grandfather was Charles Evans Hughes, former Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. H. Stuart Hughes attended Amherst College (B.A. 1937) and Harvard University (Ph.D., History 1940). Before enlisting in the armed services, Hughes taught briefly at Brown University in 1940 1941.</p>
         <p>In 1941, Hughes enlisted as a private in the Rhode Island National Guard. Later that year, he joined the Office of the Coordinator of Information within the Office of Strategic Services in Washington D.C. Hughes served in a variety of administrative and research capacities in the O.S.S. during the war, in a number of different venues, including Algeria, France, Italy, England and Germany. He was promoted several times, and was eventually elevated to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. With the end of the war in 1945, Hughes returned to Washington and took a position in the Department of State.</p>
         <p>In 1947, Hughes left the Department of State and returned to Harvard to teach half time in the Department of History and to be associate director of the Russian Research Center. Hughes was denied tenure at Harvard in 1952. He taught at Stanford University from 1952 to 1956 when he returned to the Harvard history department as an Associate Professor. Hughes remained at Harvard until 1975, when both he and his second wife, Judith, accepted positions in the history department at the University of California at San Diego. Throughout his distinguished academic career, Hughes published many books and articles on European history, and was acknowledged as one of the foremost voices in the field of European intellectual history.</p>
         <p>In 1962, Hughes ran for the United States Senate as an independent candidate from the state of Massachusetts. Although Hughes finished third in a race won by Edward Kennedy, his candidacy was one of the first to emphasize peace and nuclear disarmament at the center of a campaign platform. In 1963, he became co chairman, with Benjamin Spock, of the board of directors of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, known more commonly as SANE. Hughes stayed on as chairman of SANE, after Spock stepped down from the position in 1967, until 1970. He also was an active and outspoken critic of the Vietnam war who published articles, gave speeches and attended protests in opposition to the conflict.</p>
         <p>Hughes' leftist leanings resulted in his being suspected as a subversive on at least two occasions. In the early 1950s, he was forced to resign his military commission due to allegations that he was a communist sympathizer, although he was given an honorable discharge. In 1966, he was temporarily refused a visa to travel abroad by the State Department on charges he was a communist conspirator, which were later dropped.</p>
         <p>Hughes married twice and had three children, Sandra and Kenneth with his first wife Suzanne, and David, with his second wife Judith. He retired from the University of California at San Diego in 1986. In 1990, he published his autobiography, <title render="italic">

               <p>Arranged alphabetically by individual and corporate names and broad subject area, Correspondence primarily documents the professional activities of H. Stuart Hughes. The correspondence ranges from 1945 to 1989, but the bulk of the material falls between 1958 and the late 1970s. Hughes' own organizational structure for the files has been largely retained, and relevant cross references have been created.</p>
               <p>Arranged chronologically, materials listed under "National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy" (SANE) document Hughes' participation in the group, most notably from 1963 to 1970 when he served first as a co chair with Benjamin Spock and subsequently as chairman of the board of directors. Correspondence with SANE staff members Sanford Gottlieb, Donald Keyes, and Marie Runyon, as well as other board members such as Spock, Norman Cousins, Norman Thomas, Nathan Glazer, and Homer Jack make up the bulk of the section. Memoranda circulated among the board members and the staff, but not written by or specifically to Hughes, are also included. The files give a good representation of the activities of the group and particularly document the internal conflicts of the organization. Related but separate groups of materials pertaining to Hughes' anti war work are grouped under the headings "Vietnamese Conflict" and "Massachusetts Political Action for Peace (PAX)."</p>
               <p>The series also contains much correspondence relating to Hughes' intellectual endeavors. Letters to and from many prominent intellectuals of his time, including Vladimir Dedijer, Erik Erikson, John K. Fairbank, Richard Hofstadter, James Joll, Herbert Marcuse, and David Riesman among others, provide insight into Hughes' scholarship. Hughes' correspondence with his several publishers, including Atheneum, Harper and Row, Harvard University Press, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., Prentice Hall, and University of Chicago Press documents the publication process of his many books. For additional correspondence relating to Hughes' intellectual work, researchers should consult the Books section of the Writings series.</p>
               <p>Hughes' writings on politics and other contemporary issues, including United States foreign policy, nuclear deterrence and the Vietnam War, are further documented in his correspondence with the editors of magazines for which he wrote. Files on Martin Greenberg (Commentary) and Robert Silvers (Harper's Magazine and New York Review of Books) are particularly revealing.</p>
               <p>Hughes' active participation in many professional societies and other organizations is documented in the series. Groups of note include American Committee on Soviet Jewry, American Committee for the History of the Second World War, Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and the Congressional Liberal Group. The series also covers Hughes' tenure in his two most significant academic appointments: Harvard University and the University of California at San Diego.</p>
               <p>The series holds additional correspondence of a more personal nature, to and from friends such as Lise de Carbonnel, Fairman Cowan, Robert L. Edwards, Albert Guérard, Sr., Hans Meyerhoff, Allan Mitchell, Franco Venturi, and Roberto Vivarelli. Correspondence with family members, particularly Hughes' parents, can be found in Series IV.</p>

               <p>The series documents Hughes' 1962 campaign for a Massachusetts seat in United States Senate as an independent candidate who stressed arms control and peace issues. Correspondence arranged alphabetically within five consecutive chronological periods comprises the bulk of the series. Mail from supporters and detractors of the campaign and inter campaign correspondence and memoranda are included. A history of the campaign written in 1964 provides an excellent overview.

               <p>The series is arranged in six sections: articles and essays; books; book reviews; lectures, remarks and memoranda; student writings; and teaching materials. Each section is organized chronologically.</p>
               <p>Typescripts of short works published in books and academic and mainstream journals comprise articles and essays. Topics vary widely but include Italian and French history, historiography, American foreign policy, the Vietnam war, and nuclear disarmament. One folder of autobiographical essays is located at the beginning of the section.</p>
               <p>Books include correspondence, notes, drafts, outlines, and reviews of Hughes' many monographs. Correspondence relating to a publication includes comments from other academics and intellectuals. Researchers should also consult the files in Series I for Hughes' various publishers (Atheneum, Harper and Row, Harvard University Press, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., Prentice Hall, and University of Chicago Press) for further documentation on the publication of his books.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the series is comprised of four smaller sections. Book reviews contains reviews Hughes wrote for academic and mainstream intellectual serials. Lectures, remarks and memoranda include the texts of both formal and informal speeches delivered by Hughes at academic and political conferences, special events, and on television programs. The section also includes interviews of Hughes and testimonies by Hughes about academic colleagues. Hughes' writings from his undergraduate and graduate studies and two folders of teaching materials complete the series.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by record type and includes clippings; family correspondence; diaries and notebooks; memorabilia; military papers; and photographs.</p>
               <p>In addition to general coverage of Hughes and his family, clippings include one folder chronicling an incident when the Department of State refused Hughes a visa to travel abroad in 1966, due to suspicions about him being a subversive. He was cleared of the charges.</p>
               <p>Family correspondence comprises the most substantial portion of the series. From 1928 to 1963, he wrote a letter to his mother and/or father almost every week detailing his activities. The letters begin when he was a student at Deerfield Academy, and continue through his undergraduate years at Amherst College, his graduate years at Harvard University, his service in the United States Armed Forces in Italy and France during and after the second world war, and his professorial appointments at Harvard and Stanford University. The World War II letters give detailed accounts and impressions of the war effort. Other family correspondents include his grandfathers, Charles Evans Hughes and Henry C. Stuart, his brother Charles Evans Hughes III, his sister Helen, his first wife Suzanne, and his children, Sandra and Kenneth. Files regarding the estate of Hughes' mother, Margory Stuart Hughes, and the Charles Evans Hughes Foundation, are listed under each of these correspondents.</p>
               <p>Diaries and notebooks include travel journals from trips made to Europe in 1935 and 1941, along with a "history notebook" which Hughes compiled during his childhood years.</p>
               <p>The military records contain documentation of Hughes' service in the armed forces, including allegations of subversion, of which he was later cleared. Files listed under "Department of State" and "Office of Strategic Services" comprise reports and other papers he wrote while serving in these two branches during the war.</p>
               <p>One folder of photographs holds small portraits of Hughes from several different periods of his life.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the accession includes correspondence, writings, topical files, teaching materials, and audio recordings that primarily document the final decade of the life of H. Stuart Hughes. The correspondence primarily consists of letters written to Hughes from friends, colleagues, and other scholars, many of whom are also represented in Series I of the main accession. Topics range widely in a number of intellectual, personal, and professional areas.</p>
               <p>The accession also includes articles, reviews, speeches and talks, all filed under the heading Writings. Most of the articles and reviews are published and cover scholarly topics. Speeches and talks are separated into two categories, Notes, which give only outlines, and Texts, which provide the full content of the speech. The notes for Hughes' Senate campaign speeches provide documentation of his platform and positions and supplement other campaign materials found in the main accession. A short publication of essays looking back upon the Hughes campaign after 25 years is also filed with the Writings. A complete listing of Hughes' publications can be found in the curriculum vita folder.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the accession consists of teaching materials, personal papers, and ephemera. Audio tapes of the symposium honoring Hughes at his 1986 retirement are filed under "Approaches to European Intellectual History." Original audio tapes may not be played. For more information on copies created for research use consult the Audio Tapes appendix. The memorial service folder contains full texts of remarks made about Hughes after his death in 1999.</p>
