         <p>Theodore and Ruth Lidz were psychoanalysts who collaborated on the study and treatment of schizophrenia and also were interested in the art and anthropology of the indigenous people of the South Pacific. During a long career, Theodore Lidz wrote more than 175 articles and eight books exploring familial, social, and cultural factors involved in normal development and the development of mental disorders. Ruth Lidz also studied the psychological aspects of abortion, human fertility, and the problems of pregnant adolescents.</p>
         <p>Theodore Lidz was born on April 1, 1910, in New York City. He attended Columbia College and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving his B.A. in 1931 and his M.D. in 1936. After two years of medical internship at New Haven Hospital, he moved to Baltimore. In 1938, he became a resident in psychiatry at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic, Johns Hopkins University.</p>
         <p>Ruth Wilmanns Lidz was born on June 18, 1910, in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Karl Wilmanns, a professor of psychiatry at Heidelberg University and the granddaughter of the chemist Victor Meyer. Leaving Germany in the middle of her medical studies because she could no longer live under the Hitler regime, she spent a year in Sweden and completed her medical degree at Basel, Switzerland, in 1935. After an internship in Istanbul, she came to the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins University to work on insulin therapy for schizophrenia.</p>
         <p>Theodore and Ruth Lidz met and married in 1939. Their first son was born in 1941. When, in 1942, Theodore left for military service in the South Pacific with the Johns Hopkins Medical Unit, Ruth was placed in charge of the Phipps chemistry laboratory, became the Hopkins' electroencephalographer, and was psychiatrist to the well-baby clinic. Theodore served in New Zealand, Fiji, and Burma and was the only psychiatrist for several hundred psychiatric casualties from Guadalcanal. On his return to Hopkins in 1946, Theodore became chief of the Psychiatric Section of the Department of Medicine and initiated research on psychosomatic medicine. He continued at Johns Hopkins until 1951, as an instructor and then associate professor. With Ruth, he studied psychiatric problems among parents of patients hospitalized with schizophrenia. This work served as a basis for later studies. While in analysis with Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Ruth recognized her artistic interests that had been discouraged by her father. In her middle age, she became a fine sculptor in her spare time</p>
         <p>In 1951, Ruth and Theodore Lidz moved to New Haven where Theodore was appointed as professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and psychiatrist-in-chief of the Yale Psychiatric Clinic. Ruth established her psychoanalytic practice and joined the clinical faculty of the Yale Department of Psychiatry in 1965. Theodore was chairman of the department from 1967 to 1969. He was president of the American Psychosomatic Society from 1957 to 1958 and of the American College of Psychoanalysis in 1992. His book, <title render="italic">
               The Person
            </title>, was widely translated and became a standard text. He received the Frieda Fromm-Reichmann Award of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, the Stanley Dean Award of the American College of Psychiatrists, the William C. Meninger Award of the American College of Physicians, and the Van Giesen Award of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, primarily for his studies of the relationship between psychiatric disorders and the family environment of the patient. Although he never denied a genetic factor in causing schizophrenia, he disputed the interpretation of the statistical studies of Kety, Wender, and Rosenthal that schizophrenia was primarily a genetic disorder. Both Ruth and Theodore Lidz had reservations about the long term treatment of schizophrenic patients on neuroleptic drugs. The drugs muted negative feelings and outbursts, thus suppressing meaningful material for a therapeutic relationship. They were convinced of the patients' need for psychotherapy</p>
         <p>On a trip to the South Pacific in 1970, the Lidzes combined their psychiatric and anthropological interests. Their study of initiation rituals in Papua New Guinea led to their book <title render="italic">
               Oedipus in the Stone Age
            </title>. They also collected art objects from a variety of cultures. They donated a large collection of their indigenous artifacts to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1986.</p>
         <p>Although he retired in 1978, Theodore continued to write, lecture, and treat patients into the middle of the 1990s. To the end, he remained eager to convince others about the relevance of the family as an important factor in achieving a more fully integrated psychoanalytic theory. Ruth published twenty-five articles and contributions to books, including <title render="italic">
               Schizophrenia and the Family
            </title> and <title render="italic">
               The Woman as Patient
            </title>. Ruth died on October 9, 1995. Theodore died on February 16, 2001. They were survived by three sons, Victor, Charles, and Jerome.</p>

               <p>This series includes bibliographies, curricula vitae, correspondence, tributes, articles, and lectures of Ruth Lidz, but it reflects only a small portion of her professional activities and nothing of her private practice, teaching, sculpture, or child-rearing efforts. The bulk of the series dates from the 1970s and 1980s. The autobiographical sketches describe her early training and experience. The correspondence here is addressed to Ruth Lidz and is related to her professional work. Additional letters, addressed to both Ruth and Theodore, are included in Series II. Writings are arranged chronologically.</p>

               <p>The series is composed of correspondence, reports, radio programs, and files relating to professional meetings, arranged alphabetically by personal or corporate name. Correspondents include peers, students, organizations, institutions, and publishers. Copies of replies to the letters received are often included. Although the vast majority of letters concern topics in psychiatry, Theodore also wrote to government leaders about political issues, especially human rights abuses. Many of these letters were part of a Freedom Writers program of Amnesty International. The bulk of the material is from 1960s to the 1980s. The series includes correspondence from colleagues who were also friends. Lawrence Kubie probably influenced Theodore's decision to go into psychiatry. Eugene Brody, editor of the <title render="italic">
                     Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease
                  </title>, involved Theodore in editorial matters. Frederick Redlich helped recruit Theodore to the Yale Department of Psychiatry, and they continued to work closely together when Redlich became the dean of the Yale Medical School. The series documents Theodore's efforts as a founding fellow and active participant in the American College of Psychoanalysts. The American Journal of Psychiatry files contain references to Theodore's refutation of the Danish-American studies of adopted twins used as subjects to try to prove the genetic component in the etiology of schizophrenia. Gilbert Herdt, anthropologist, and Theodore had common interest in the rituals of New Guinea tribes.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series includes documentation concerning Theodore Lidz's publications and speeches, as well as research materials compiled over his professional career. Lidz's interest in schizophrenia looms large in this writing and research, but there is also material on New Guinea, the role of the family, and training for psychiatrists. It is not clear what percentage of Lidz's publications are represented. The available bibliographies (see Series V) end in the 1980s, although Lidz continued to publish after that date. As a general rule, drafts and reprints of published titles have not been retained. Lectures delivered to classes are included in Series IV, Teaching.</p>
               <p>The series is divided into several sections. The section Books contains manuscripts for unpublished works, correspondence associated with a title, and book reviews. Books are listed alphabetically by title. "To Carve a Space Out of Chaos" contains published papers as well as an autobiographical "Epilogue." "Youth: A Critical Passage" is also autobiographical, and in it Lidz discusses the influence of his father's death. "Our Stone Age Contemporaries" describes customs of the Papua new Guinea peoples.</p>
               <p>The section's other writings includes materials about published papers, chapters contributed to monographs, book reviews, letters to the editor, and the like, while the section Lectures and other presentations includes similar materials for talks, presentations at professional meetings, remarks at conference sessions, and interviews. Many of these contain untitled and/or undated typescripts or reading notes. Titles shown with quotation marks are those shown on the manuscript. Where Lidz provided no title, an assigned subject is shown in the listing. The dated items are arranged chronologically. Those without dates [noted as 'no date'] are arranged alphabetically by title or subject at the end. The Notes section, arranged alphabetically by subject, includes Lidz's reasoned analysis of readings, both literary and psychiatric, that he most likely created in preparation for writings or lectures.</p>
               <p>The Research files include studies of various medical and psychological problems that might affect the mental states of patients and selected patient files from Lidz's private practice. The most substantive materials are those on families, compiled as part of Lidz's work on <title render="italic">
                     Schizophrenia and the Family
                  </title>. The data includes excerpts of hospital records, correspondence, psychological tests of the patient and members of the immediate family, summaries of the individual cases, and transcripts of family group meetings. The detailed investigations describe current psychoanalytic insights, techniques for testing, and therapy by a group of established experts. For Lidz, these confirmed the influence of the family environment in causing schizophrenia. Creative efforts by the patient, such as poems, drawings, and writings, are included in some case studies. To protect confidentiality, the study's researchers referred to the families using coded names. The family names used in this register are the coded version of the real name. The data section also contains additional family materials, including private patient cases that may have been retained to provide data for other projects. The section reflects Lidz's own arrangement in keeping these files together. The names are listed by initials or a truncated form of the family name.</p>

               <p>The Teaching files represent only a small percentage of Lidz's teaching career and are only those materials that Theodore Lidz chose to preserve. First year medical school lectures and outlines over several years are included. The files may also contain notes, lectures, syllabi, correspondence, and discussion of curricula. Some courses at other institutions besides Yale School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins are included, specifically for institutions abroad and for the U.S. Army.</p>
