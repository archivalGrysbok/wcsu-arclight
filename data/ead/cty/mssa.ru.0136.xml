               <p>Santiago Calatrava, a leading world architect, delivered the 2007 Tanner Lectures on Human Values on October 3 and 4 at the Whitney Humanities Center, 53 Wall St. His first talk, "Wings and a Prayer," was delivered on October 3 at 4:30 p.m. and his second, "A Collection of Pearls," was delivered on October 4 at 6:30 p.m. Videorecordings of these lectures are are available in RU 880, ACCN 2008-A-048, Boxes 6-7.</p>
               <p>Trained in Spain and Switzerland, the Spanish-born Calatrava is renowned internationally for his architectural and engineering designs. His works range from bridges and train stations to libraries and museums. His most celebrated projects include his expansion of the Milwaukee Art Museum (2001), his first building in the United States; Sondica Airport, Bilbao (2000); James Joyce Bridge, Dublin (2003); the Auditorio de Tenerife, Santa Cruz, Canary Islands (2003); and Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay, Redding, California (2004). Nearing completion are the Petach Tikvah Bridge, Tel Aviv; Quarto Ponte Sul Grand Canale, Venice; and the Palacio de las Artes, the last building for Valencia's City of Arts and Sciences. Calatrava is the winner of numerous honors and prizes, including the 2000 Algur H. Meadows Award for Excellence in the Arts, the 2005 Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects and many honorary doctorates.</p>
               <p>The Tanner Lectures on Human Values were established by the American scholar, industrialist and philanthropist Obert Clark Tanner, who hoped that these lectures would contribute to the intellectual and moral life of humankind.</p>
