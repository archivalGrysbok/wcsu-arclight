         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>George Rosen was born June 23, 1910 in Brooklyn, New York. He was educated in the public schools of New York City before attending the City College of New York, where he graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Rosen acquired his M.D. from the University of Berlin in 1935. At the suggestion of Henry Sigerist, Rosen wrote a historical dissertation on the reception and influence in Europe of the research of William Beaumont, the American physician-physiologist. This work sparked a lifelong interest in the history of medicine.</p>
         <p>With the rise of the Nazis, Rosen returned to the United States soon after obtaining his degree. He interned at Beth-El Hospital before starting a private practice in ophthalmology and otolaryngology. In 1941, he gave up his medical practice to work in the New York City Department of Public Health as a clinic physician in the Bureau of Tuberculosis. He later became a district health officer and then Director of the Bureau of Health Education.</p>
         <p>While working in these capacities, Rosen also continued his research, writing, and studies. In the years 1938-1944, he edited the journal <emph render="italic">Ciba Symposia</emph>with his wife, Beate Caspari-Rosen, and he published his first monograph, <emph render="italic">The History of Miners' Diseases: A Medical and Social Interpretation</emph>, in 1944. In 1941, he began graduate studies in sociology at Columbia University, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in 1947.</p>
         <p>Rosen served in World War II as a medical intelligence officer in the Division of Preventative Medicine within the Surgeon General's office. Shortly after the war, he participated in the interrogation of Nazi generals in London as a translator.</p>
         <p>Upon returning from Europe after the war, Rosen resumed his public health career and his studies at Columbia University, where he obtained a master's degree in public health in 1950. Also in that year, Rosen was appointed director of the Division of Health Education and Preventative Services of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, while he concurrently held the position of professor of public health education in the School of Public Health and Administrative Medicine at Columbia. In 1969, he devoted himself full-time to scholarly pursuits, joining the Department of History of Science and Medicine at Yale University, where he also taught courses in Yale College, the Graduate School, and the School of Medicine.</p>
         <p>George Rosen was best known for the breadth and volume of his scholarly work which covered many topics and time periods. He published eleven books and over two hundred articles on topics relating to the history of medicine and public health. He also served as editor of the American Journal of Public Health (1957-1973) and Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences (1946-1952), which he also helped to incorporate.</p>
         <p>Rosen and his wife Beate met at the University of Berlin while both were medical students, and they were married in 1933. They had two children, Susan and Peter. George Rosen died on July 27, 1977 in Oxford, England.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, the series consists primarily of George Rosen's professional correspondence with historians, physicians, sociologists, public health officials, publishers, and professional organizations. The majority of the correspondence is incoming, although there are many letters written by Rosen in the files.</p>
               <p>Rosen's correspondence with fellow historians of medicine and science, public health administrators and educators, and physicians provides documentation on the intellectual discourse in the respective disciplines during the middle part of the twentieth century.

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically and documents George Rosen's service to the American Public Health Association, particularly his contributions to the <emph render="italic">American Journal of Public Health</emph>. Rosen began serving on the editorial board of the journal in 1948 and became editor in 1957, a post he held until 1973. The files on the journal consist of correspondence, minutes, reports, and contributed manuscripts, primarily from the last five years of his tenure as editor.</p>
               <p>Other general files documenting the association include correspondence, pamphlets and other printed matter, and topical files. Seven folders of material on the Statistics Section comprise a substantial portion of the series.</p>
               <p>Photographs taken at the annual conference of the association from 1928 to 1937 can be found in Series VI.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, Subject Files consist of materials documenting organizations, individuals, publications, and topics of interest to Rosen. The files documenting the publication <emph render="italic">Ciba Symposia</emph>comprise the most substantial section of the series. George Rosen and his wife, Beate Caspari-Rosen, shared editorial duties for the journal and each of their tenures is documented separately. Adhering to the original order of the materials, the George Rosen files are arranged chronologically, while the Beate Caspari-Rosen files are arranged alphabetically.</p>
               <p>The series also includes folders documenting other publications, most notably <emph render="italic">Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences</emph>, which Rosen helped incorporate in 1946 and edited until 1952. Correspondence in Series I with Henry Schuman and Madeline Stanton also includes documentation of this journal.</p>
               <p>The National Institute of Health represents the most significant of the many organizations documented in the series. The materials document Rosen's work on an oral history grant project on the history of health research in the United States and include correspondence, reports, proposals, and outlines. Transcripts of the project reside in the National Library of Medicine.</p>
               <p>Files on a number of individuals such as Michael Alexis, Francis Blake, Harvey Cushing, Haven Emerson, Joseph Mountin, Milton Rosenau, A. M. Stimson, Edward Streeter and Charles-Edward Amory Winslow contain collected information and reflect Rosen's research interests. The same is true of the topical files covering cancer, dance frenzy, infant care, life expectancy, respiratory devices, and tuberculosis.</p>

               <p>Consisting of articles and books, writings are arranged alphabetically by title and cover a wide range of topics mostly related to public health and the history of medicine and science. Spanning the course of his career, most of the writings are drafts of subsequently published articles. Some folders also include correspondence, notes, and other materials documenting the process of writing and publishing. The series also includes several entries Rosen wrote on prominent individuals for biographical dictionaries. Three folders of book reviews written by Rosen and one folder of reviews of Rosen's work are filed at the end of the series.</p>

               <p>The series consists of family correspondence, memorabilia, clippings, biographical material, and photographs documenting the life of George Rosen and his family. Rosen's curriculum vitae list his publications and work history. One folder of correspondence and other materials relating to his son, Peter Rosen, and daughter, Susan (Rosen) Koslow, is filed under "Children." There are a small number of photographs of the Rosens, but the majority of the photographs document the exhibit halls at the American Public Health Association annual meetings from 1928 to 1937.</p>
