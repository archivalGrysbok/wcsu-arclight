         <abstract id="aspace_8ed61179f859da8c2afe87a6fde42dd6">Correspondence, consultations, surveys, writings, printed material, and other papers of Edwin Richard Weinerman. Material primarily reflects Weinerman's interest in public health and deals with his activities both as a consultant and administrator with various public and private health careorganizations, including the U. S. Public Health Service, Permanente Health Plan, American Public Health Association, and the Yale-New Haven Hospital. A significant part of the collection also relates to Weinerman's social and political activities, especially his concern over dangers of air pollution, nuclear warfare and radiation poisoning, and his opposition to the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Levering Act which required loyalty oaths as a condition for medical licensure. The papers also include notebooks and course papers from his own studies at Harvard and New York University (1945-1948) as well as teaching materials from the University of California. His professional program is documented in grant applications (1963-1972), two speeches and letters written in preparation for his trip abroad in 1970, collected works (articles), and curriculum vitae. Also in the papers are letters of condolence and a transcript and audio tapes of the memorial service at Yale University following his death in 1970. These papers form part of the Contemporary Medical Care and Health Policy Collection.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Edwin Richard Weinerman was born on July 17, 1917 in Hartford, Connecticut. He attended Yale University, graduating with honors in 1938. He then entered Georgetown University School of Medicine, graduating magna cum laude in 1942. While a student at Georgetown in 1940, Weinerman married Shirley Basch.</p>
         <p>After receiving his medical degree, Weinerman served as a Resident in Communicable Diseases at the Charles V. Chapin Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island and as Medical House Officer at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.</p>
         <p>Weinerman entered active military duty in 1943. From August, 1943 until March, 1944 he was a Resident in Internal Medicine at Drew Field Regional Hospital in Florida. He also served in Europe from April 1944 to October 1945 as the chief of a combat shock team with the United States Army 4th Auxillary Surgical Group. He was discharged from the Army in January of 1946.</p>
         <p>After his discharge, Weinerman became Assistant Chief Medical Officer of the Health Services Division of the Farm Security Administration, planning and administering medical care programs for rural farm families. When this program was restricted in 1947, Weinerman left the FSA and, from March to September, became an Associate in Medical Care Administration in the Division of Public Health Methods of the United States Public Health Service. In this position, he consulted on medical care and public health programs including child health services and the health care aspects of universal military training.</p>
         <p>In the fall of 1947, Weinerman entered the Harvard University School of Public Health with the support of a fellowship from the National Institute of Infantile Paralysis. He graduated magna cum laude in 1948.</p>
         <p>After receiving his public health degree, Weinerman joined the faculty of the University of California School of Public Health. From the fall of 1948 to 1950, Weinerman was Associate Professor of Medical Economics and Head of the Division of Medical Care Administration. He taught both graduates and undergraduates, did research in medical economics, and consulted on medical care organization.</p>
         <p>Weinerman left the University in 1950 during a controversy over faculty "loyalty oaths" and accepted a job with the Permanente (now Kaiser) Health Plan. He served as Medical Director of this prepaid group practice health plan in 1950 and 1951 and had overall direction of the medical care aspects of the program. But as a result of policy disagreements with the founder of the plan, Dr. Sidney R. Garfield, and its main sponsor, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, Weinerman resigned in 1951.</p>
         <p>To refresh his medical knowledge and skills after several years of administrative and academic work, Weinerman arranged for a special residency at the San Francisco Veteran's Administration Hospital in 1952-1953. He also began a private practice of internal medicine in El Cerrito, California, where he served until 1962. From 1955 to 1962, Weinerman also served as the Medical Director of the Herrick Memorial Hospital Clinics. In addition, he was the Physician-in-Charge of the Rheumatic Fever Clinic of the Contra Costa County Health Department from 1953 to 1962.</p>
         <p>In 1962, Weinerman left private practice in California to become Director of Ambulatory Services at Yale-New Haven Hospital and Associate Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the Yale School of Medicine. He was promoted to full professor in 1965. He resigned as Director of Ambulatory Services in 1968 to become head of the section on Medical Care and Hospital Administration of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health in the School of Medicine. During his years at Yale, Weinerman concentrated on the reorganization and improvement of ambulatory services and did much to increase the efficiency of the emergency room and upgrade the quality of care. He also worked to improve relations between the Medical School and the surrounding community.</p>
         <p>Weinerman was a frequent consultant on health care subjects and conducted numerous surveys and evaluations of health care plans, clinics, and hospitals and was an advocate of "social medicine." To Weinerman, this was a concept of medicine which included the study of the relationships between health and social and economic forces. He was particularly interested in the economics, organization, and quality of medical care and wanted to reorganize the haphazard American medical care system to provide adequate health care for all people. To achieve this goal, he supported prepaid group practice health programs, which he felt should incorporate five basic principles:</p>
         <p>1) prepayment based on family coverage</p>
         <p>2) group medical practice of physicians and auxiliary health workers</p>
         <p>3) medical centers, coordinated in regional networks</p>
         <p>4) preventive medicine</p>
         <p>5) democratic control of policy</p>
         <p>Weinerman also supported programs for national health systems like the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill of the late 1940's.</p>
         <p>Weinerman was interested in the organization of medical care in foreign countries as well as in America. He was the author of <title render="italic">
               Social Medicine in Western Europe
            </title>, a report of a survey made in 1950. He also made a survey of Eastern European health care in 1967 which he described in <title render="italic">
               Social Medicine in Eastern Europe.
            </title>
         </p>
         <p>Weinerman's interests were not strictly limited to medicine. He was an impassioned defender of civil liberties and during the early 1950's he opposed "loyalty oaths" and other attempts to attach political tests as a condition for licensure or employment. He became an active opponent of the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was a member of the California Democratic Council. In addition, Weinerman was deeply concerned about the hazards of nuclear weapons and radiation and about air pollution and smog. He was also a vigorous opponent of the war in Vietnam.</p>
         <p>In 1970, while on sabbatical, Weinerman and his wife were killed when a terrorist bomb destroyed the airplane that was taking them to Israel, They were beginning a survey of health care in Israel, New Zealand, and Japan. Weinerman was 52 years old.</p>
         <p>The E. R. Weinerman Papers will be useful to researchers interested in the development of social medicine in the United States from the end of World War Two until 1970. This broad topic includes the development of prepaid group practice health plans, and other attempts to improve the economics and organization of health care. The correspondence, surveys, and other material in the Weinerman Papers reveal the gradual acceptance of many medical ideas that were once anathema to most American physicians.</p>
         <p>The Weinerman Papers contain the surveys, studies, and plans of numerous group health programs in which Weinerman developed and tested his ideas. The Papers will also be useful to those interested in the organization of ambulatory and emergency room services, one of Weinerman's main concerns during his years at Yale. In addition there are materials relating to some of the social and political issues of the 1950s and 1960s. Of particular interest, because of its impact on Weinerman's own profession and career, is the material relating to the House Committee on Un-American Activities and his opposition to "loyalty oaths."</p>

         <p>In 1962, Weinerman accepted a joint appointment as Associate Professor of Medicine and Public Health at the Yale University School of Medicine and as Director of Ambulatory Services at the Yale-New Haven Hospital (then known as Grace-New Haven Community Hospital). In 1965, Weinerman was promoted to full professor. In 1968, Weinerman resigned as Director of Ambulatory Services to become the full-time head of the section on Medical Care in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health. This section includes several reports by Weinerman on his programs and progress while he held the joint appointment. There is also material in this section on several conferences on ambulatory services organized by Weinerman. Memoranda and papers on the organization and administration of the Yale-New Haven Hospital Emergency Room and Clinics are also filed in this section along with papers relating to Weinerman's teaching and other duties. Also filed in this section are copies of applications by the Hill Neighborhood Corporation in collaboration with Yale for a grant to fund a comprehensive health services project.</p>
         <p>26) SOCIAL MEDICINE IN EASTERN EUROPE</p>
         <p>In the spring of 1967, Weinerman visited Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland on a Commonwealth Fund Faculty Travel Award to survey the organization of health services and the training of health personnel in Eastern European countries. This section includes some correspondence, a manuscript copy of Weinerman's report, and a printer's copy of the report used by the Harvard University Press.</p>
         <p>27) MISCELLANEOUS CONSULTATIONS</p>
         <p>This section includes Weinerman's proposals for a health center program for the ILWU Welfare Fund.</p>
         <p>28) BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR HEALTH SURVEY OF ISRAEL, NEW ZEALAND, AND JAPAN</p>
         <p>In the beginning of 1970, Weinerman and his wife began a tour to survey health care in Israel, New Zealand, and Japan. This section contains an assortment of reprints, pamphlets, books, and other material that Weinerman used to prepare for his uncompleted survey trip.</p>
         <p>The third series, MEDICAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, contains both material relating specifically to Weinerman's career as a physician interested in social medicine and material reflecting his broader political and social concerns.</p>
         <p>This series contains a wide variety of material issued by medical and public health organizations. These include the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the Group Health Association of America, the Physicians Forum, and many others. This material, though varying from organization to organization, consists mainly of announcements, appeals, notices, and reports. There are also many newsletters, pamphlets, and other publications. Some correspondence, originally filed with this section, has been removed and filed in the CORRESPONDENCE series. This has been noted in the affected sections.</p>
         <p>Of particular interest are papers dealing with the founding of the Medical Care Section of the American Public Health Association. There are also papers relating to the development of the Group Health Association of America from its predecessors, the Cooperative Health Federation of America, the Group Health Federation of America, and the American Labor Health Association. In addition, there are papers on the Physician's Forum, Physicians for Social Responsibility, the</p>
         <p>Medical Committee for Human Rights and other organizations that reflect Weinerman's concern with the political and social aspects of medicine.</p>
         <p>Other material in this series reflects this concern in a broader context. Weinerman was involved in many activities and organizations besides those that related directly to his medical career. For example, Weinerman was a prime mover in the East Bay Committee for American Activities and the East Bay Community Forum that opposed the House Committee on Un-American Activities. This series contains pamphlets, letters, and statements by those organizations as well as numerous articles, advertisements, and newspaper clippings about the House Committee and McCarthyism.</p>
         <p>Weinerman was also involved in organizations like the East Bay Physicians' Committee for Civil Liberties and the Federation for the Repeal of the Levering Act that organized against attempts to impose political tests as a condition for medical licensure or employment. This series also contains articles, newspaper clippings, and pamphlets on the loyalty oath controversy at the University of California in the early 1950s.</p>
         <p>Also included in this third series is material on Weinerman's work with the California Democratic Council developing issues and platforms.</p>
         <p>Another major concern of Weinerman's was nuclear weapons and radiation hazards. Weinerman was well informed on this subject, and worked to alert the public to the dangers of nuclear testing and fallout. This series contains an extensive file of articles, newspaper clippings, and pamphlets on this subject. Weinerman was also concerned about air pollution and smog. Series III contains material on these topics also.</p>
         <p>The fourth series, ADDRESSES AND WRITINGS, consists of articles, papers, addresses, and talks that span Weinerman's career from his days as a medical student to his untimely death.</p>
         <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by title of address or writing. Although the material varies from title to title it includes notes, early drafts, revisions, tearsheets, abstracts, and reprints. Some newspaper clippings and press releases are also filed with some titles. Additional material on some of the articles in this series is filed in Series II, CONSULTATIONS, PROJECTS, AND PROFESSIONAL ASSIGNMENTS. When this is so, it has been noted on the appropriate folder.</p>
         <p>Some correspondence was originally filed with the addresses and writings in this series. This has been removed and placed in the CORRESPONDENCE series. This has been noted in the affected Sections.</p>
         <p>Scripts for broadcasts made by Weinerman on health care topics over radio station KPFA, Berkeley, California and some articles on health care topics, evidently written by Weinerman for a union oriented press service, are filed at the end of the series. There is also an article on national health insurance by Weinerman's wife entitled, "The Pains of a New Idea."</p>
         <p>The fifth series, PERSONAL PAPERS AND MISCELLANEOUS, contains a variety of biographical materials about Weinerman including an autobiographical sketch, curricula vitae, magazine and newspaper clippings, and photographs. This series also includes letters, papers, and other documents relating to Weinerman's medical licensure, his military service and his private medical practice. The series also includes many of Weinerman's travel expense reports and vouchers from his frequent travels. There are also numerous miscellaneous bills, invoices, and receipts.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Correspondence, consultations, surveys, writings, printed material, and other papers of Edwin Richard Weinerman. Material primarily reflects Weinerman's interest in public health and deals with his activities both as a consultant and administrator with various public and private health careorganizations, including the U. S. Public Health Service, Permanente Health Plan, American Public Health Association, and the Yale-New Haven Hospital. A significant part of the collection also relates to Weinerman's social and political activities, especially his concern over dangers of air pollution, nuclear warfare and radiation poisoning, and his opposition to the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the Levering Act which required loyalty oaths as a condition for medical licensure. The papers also include notebooks and course papers from his own studies at Harvard and New York University (1945-1948) as well as teaching materials from the University of California. His professional program is documented in grant applications (1963-1972), two speeches and letters written in preparation for his trip abroad in 1970, collected works (articles), and curriculum vitae. Also in the papers are letters of condolence and a transcript and audio tapes of the memorial service at Yale University following his death in 1970. These papers form part of the Contemporary Medical Care and Health Policy Collection.</p>

               <p>The fourth series, ADDRESSES AND WRITINGS, is arranged alphabetically by title. When a folder contains only notes for an address or talk, this is indicated by the word <title render="italic">
                     notes
                  </title> in parentheses after the title.</p>
               <p>This series also contains some scripts of radio broadcasts made by Weinerman and some articles written by Weinerman for a newspaper press service. These are placed after the alphabetically arranged file of addresses and writings. Filed at the end of the series, is an article written by Weinerman's wife, Shirley (Basch) Weinerman.</p>
