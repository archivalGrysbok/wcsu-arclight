         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Over four hundred letters and cards addressed to Edward Comfort Starr make up this collection. A few of the letters are from relatives, including one from his sister-in-law Lizzie DeForest written during a visit to China in 1907 and describing, among other things, victims of famine in Nanking; there are also several letters to members of the Lay family (the family of Starr's mother) who were involved with mission work. The majority of the letters, however, are from fellow ministers and missionaries of the Congregational Church, most of them in Connecticut, although there are also a few letters from missionaries in Asia. The letters deal with church business and other professional matters, such as the activities of various missionary societies, the setting up of Sunday schools and other aspects of religious education. The letters are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
         <p>The provenance of these letters is unknown.</p>
