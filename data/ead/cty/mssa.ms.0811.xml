         <p>The papers document Arthur Jack Viseltear's scholarship and professional interests in the field of public health. They include materials related to his teaching and research, documentation of his professional activities, and personal papers which include his diaries from 1974 to 1989. Unpublished writings include research notebooks for his biography of C.-E. A. Winslow and tapes and transcripts of interviews for his study of the contemporary Yale School of Medicine of his time.</p>
         <p>After earning his bachelor's degree in history from Tulane University in 1959, he spent the following year there studying the history of public health. He then moved to UCLA, completing his M.P.H. in 1963 and his Ph.D. in 1965 in history with a focus on the history of medicine.</p>
         <p>During the academic year, 1962 1963, he was a teaching assistant at UCLA. As a predoctoral fellow from 1963 to 1964, he did research in English archives. He returned to UCLA as an associate in Medical Care, 1964 1965, and then continued as an associate research historian and lecturer in Public Health from 1965 through 1969. He sought financial support for his graduate training and received several prestigious awards, a predoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a Wellcome Trust grant for research during the summer of 1965, and a grant from the American Philosophical Society in 1966. In September 1969, he went to the Yale School of Medicine as assistant professor where he taught courses in the history of medicine and public health and seminars which focused on health policy, contemporary health issues, and the physician in modern society. He was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1979.</p>
         <p>Milton Roemer, Isidore Falk, and George Rosen significantly influenced Viseltear's life and career as colleagues, mentors, and good friends. Roemer shepherded Viseltear's thesis to completion, helped shift Viseltear's interest from history to public health, guided his first teaching efforts at UCLA, and continued to share professional interests. With Falk, who was teaching public health when he arrived, Viseltear shared an interest in the contemporary health insurance movement. Falk supplied Viseltear with information on Winslow when Viseltear was writing an entry for the Dictionary of American Biography in 1977. Viseltear's interest in writing a full length biography may date from that time. George Rosen's appointment at Yale combined public health and medical history as Viseltear's did. When Rosen died unexpectedly, Viseltear took over his course in the history of medicine.</p>
         <p>In 1974, Viseltear was one of the inaugural group of six Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellows selected for a year of seminars at the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C. and staff assignment to the U.S. Congress. The fellowships were established by the Institute of Medicine with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to provide outstanding mid career health professionals working in academic settings a better understanding of major issues in health policy and a knowledge of how federal health programs are established. The program was intended to create a more constructive relationship between the academic professionals and the government.</p>
         <p>Viseltear first worked with Kentucky Republican Representative Tim Lee Carter, the ranking minority member on the subcommittee on public health and the environment. Viseltear contributed to the National Health Education and Promotion Act of 1975. The Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan [CHIP] was added to this proposal. Viseltear also worked on a proposal for a professional standards review organization. For his second congressional assignment, Viseltear worked with LeRoy Goldman, principal staff assistant to the Senate's health subcommittee chairman, Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Viseltear interested Goldman in his ideas about health education. They were ultimately incorporated in a bill that became the National Health Information and Disease Control Act of 1976 (S. 1466).</p>
         <p>Viseltear also served on the governing councils of the American Association for the History of Medicine and the American Public Health Association (APHA). He was chairman of the Medical Care Section and the Intersectional Council of the American Public Health Association and served as chairman of the NIH Health Study Section on the History of Medicine. He served on Yale University committees including search committees for the dean of the medical school, the associate dean for government and community affairs and the librarian of the Medical Library, as well as committees on planning and priorities, the basic sciences, and tenure policy.</p>
         <p>In addition, Viseltear served as a member of the Professions Program Panel of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship Board, and the editorial boards of the <title render="italic">

               Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine
            </title>. He was named advisor to the Contemporary Medical Care and Health Policy Collection of the Yale University Library in 1975 and in this capacity wrote grant proposals and made solicitations to build the collection. Viseltear's friends and acquaintances are reflected in the collection, which includes the papers of Isidore Falk, George Rosen, Franz Goldmann, and George Silver.</p>
         <p>In 1980, Viseltear led a summer seminar entitled "The Physician in Modern Society" sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities. In the same year, he began thinking about a project to create an oral history of the Yale Medical School. He delivered the commencement addresses at the Yale School of Medicine in 1981 and at the School of Epidemiology and Public Health in 1988. In 1983, he was elected to the Connecticut Academy of Science and Engineering. He was co recipient of the Francis Gilman Blake Award for Distinguished Teaching in the medical school in 1988.</p>
         <p>Viseltear married Elaine Jean Fedors on February 20, 1966. They had two sons, Jason Adam, born September 14, 1970, and Bennet Franklin, born March 4, 1972. He died on January 7, 1990 after a long bout with cancer.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The papers document Viseltear's scholarly interest in the history of public health, his dedication to teaching and to his students, his enthusiasm for the planning and development of government health care policy, and his energetic efforts to fulfill his responsibilities to professional organizations and the university. Of particular note are materials relating to public health policy and the teaching of medicine at Yale. The papers also provide evidence of Viseltear's interest in health insurance, osteopathy, and oral history.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series contains correspondence largely concerning Viseltear's professional interests and dating from his graduate school days and forward. The correspondence is predominantly with colleagues about professional matters, and there is only a small amount of correspondence with his family and friends. Additional correspondence is scattered through the remaining five series.</p>
               <p>Viseltear arranged the correspondence in this series in two sections. There are alphabetical files arranged under the name of the correspondent, as well as a section arranged in chronological order. The alphabetical files contain incoming letters and often a carbon of Viseltear's response while the chronological files contain outgoing carbon copies. They also include memoranda and proposals drafted by Viseltear.</p>
               <p>The chronological section can be used to trace the development of issues and projects from conception to fruition or termination. The increase in volume of chronological files in the late 1970s and 1980s reflects Viseltear's burgeoning activities on professional committees. Although there is clearly overlap between the sections and with the correspondence filed in other series, the chronological files provide the most complete record of Viseltear's endeavors.</p>
               <p>The researcher should note that Series II contains letters associated with committee responsibilities and academic issues, Series III contains correspondence relevant to grant proposals and publications, Series IV includes communications with students and administrators, Series V contains subject relevant correspondence, and Series VI has letters concerning career decisions, such as appointments and recruitments.</p>

               <p>Arranged alphabetically, this series documents Viseltear's work on committees of the American Public Health Association and the American Association for the History of Medicine, his year as a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow and his contributions to various Yale University committees. The files of his Robert Wood Johnson Healthy Policy Fellowship are particularly rich in details of the day by day development of health policy legislation and of Viseltear's influence. They include successive drafts of legislation, briefings on bills, drafts of floor statements to introduce bills, the selection of witnesses to present testimony before Congress, prompt cards, questions to ask witnesses, as well as reviews of their testimony.</p>
               <p>There are voluminous files on Viseltear's work as chairman of the Medical Care Section of the APHA, of the Yale Medical School Council, and of the Weinerman Memorial Fund Committee. The series contains his grant proposals for funding his own research as well as for the establishment of the Contemporary Medical Care and Health Policy Collection (CMCHPC). The files for the Yale University Library document his efforts to develop and encourage contributions to the CMCHPC. Materials gathered under the general headings for Yale University and the Yale School of Medicine document Viseltear's participation on committees on which he did not play a major role.</p>
               <p>The series also includes files related to Viseltear's editorial work on several professional journals, including the <title render="italic">
                     Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences
                  </title>, the <title render="italic">
                     Journal of Biology and Medicine
                  </title>, and the <title render="italic">
                     Bulletin of the History of Medicine
                  </title>. His participation in the 1987 Bellagio Conference on Education in Public Health is documented, as well as the subsequent efforts to publish a book on the proceedings. The Exhibits files delineate Viseltear's contributions to three exhibits in the Cushing Rotunda of the Yale Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. Papers associated with Viseltear's activities for the Nathan Smith and Beaumont Clubs have been added to the archives of the two societies at the Medical Historical Library of the Yale Cushing/Whitney Medical Library.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The files in this series are divided into three sections: published writings, unpublished writings, and public statements. Files in each section may contain drafts, notes, outlines, and any associated correspondence. The series does not include notes for course lectures, which are in Series IV.</p>
               <p>The published writings section is composed of journal articles followed by book reviews. Each type of published writing is arranged in chronological order. A bibliography of these publications is attached to Viseltear's résumé in the biographical folder in Series VI.</p>
               <p>Viseltear's unpublished writings include book projects, journal articles, and his doctoral dissertation. Some of these files are for large projects left incomplete at the time of Viseltear's death and are of overlapping and/or indeterminate date. The files in this section are arranged, therefore, only in rough chronological order. For some book projects, there are files of research notes, which are arranged by Viseltear's topical categories. The subjects of the unpublished writings are similar to those of the published writings, and it is possible that some of the unpublished drafts were used as the basis for a later published title</p>
               <p>The massive research files for the C. E. A. Winslow biography contain notes on Winslow's colleagues, professional associations, parents, and schools. There are more than 3,000 photocopies, mainly of professional correspondence, from the Winslow Papers in the Yale Library, but there are only a few drafts of chapters.</p>
               <p>The "333 Cedar Street" files contain research materials and successive drafts for a history of the Yale Medical School. These include interviews with students, faculty, and staff, which provide personal insights into contemporary medical education issues. The interviewees discuss premedical education, the medical school, its curriculum, the Yale System, colleagues, specialty choices, clinical and laboratory experiences, issues for women and minorities, and their future plans. Both tapes and transcripts are available for most of the nearly fifty interviews, arranged alphabetically by the initial of the last name. The full names are given when they are known. The transcriptions include handwritten drafts and/or typed versions. The original tapes may not be played. For information on copies created for research use consult the Audio Tape appendix.</p>
               <p>The public statements include lectures, introductory remarks, and radio talks. The lecture files are arranged chronologically and document invited talks at academic institutions and papers contributed at professional meetings. Talks given at a colleague's course or contributed to a seminar program are in the folder "Guest lectures." Radio talks, at the end of the series, include Viseltear's contributions to two programs on public health. On "Doctors in Society," a public affairs program on the role of the physician in society and the quality of health care in California, Viseltear discusses contemporary health issues that echo eighteenth century concerns.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series contains notes and outlines for courses Viseltear taught at three institutions. Files are arranged in alphabetical order by institution and then by the course abbreviation and number. All the Yale University courses are in one sequence regardless of the school or department in which they were given. In addition to courses shown as EPH [Epidemiology and Public Health], other public health courses are listed under MC [Medical Care] or HSA [Health Services Administration].</p>
               <p>Viseltear was faculty mentor for student public health projects in EPH110 course, "The Design and Implementation of Public Policy." The series includes interview outlines, meetings, and reports of the projects carried out in the local communities of Guilford, Madison, and Branford, Connecticut.</p>
               <p>The course outline for HM100, the history of medicine, which had stayed the same from 1977 1980, was entirely reworked in 1981. There are extensive subject notes associated with the reorganization.</p>

               <p>This series contains files on topics about which Viseltear wrote and lectured but which could not be positively associated with a particular course or publication. The notes have been filed by subject, in alphabetical order. Much of the material is undated. The notes are predominantly handwritten, though the files also include a few photocopies. The large numbers of government and organizational pamphlets and newspaper clippings that Viseltear accumulated have not been retained.</p>

               <p>This series includes biographical information, memorabilia, reminiscences, and diaries, as well as a few personal photographs. "Reminiscences...1938 1969" was written in 1986 1987 as a preamble to the diaries which Viseltear started keeping in 1974. The reminiscences recall Viseltear's home, parents, neighborhood, and emphasize his years at DeWitt Clinton High School, Tulane University, and then at UCLA. He describes his transition from a pre medical student to a student of history and public health</p>
               <p>There are eighteen volumes of diaries from 1974 March to 1989 November. Viseltear usually wrote in them several times a week and added occasional supplemental entries to amplify them further. Diary pages are occasionally interleaved with invitations, letters, clippings, and memorabilia. Viseltear reports discussions with colleagues, his views on events and their political and strategic implications, as well as musings on personal happenings. He evaluates himself, his work, his colleagues, and his friends. The diaries begin with his experience as a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow and provide details and impressions of his daily responsibilities as the member of a congressman's staff. They describe his return to academic life and also record personal events, continuing until a month before his death. There are also two notebooks of separate diary entries in the folder labeled "Personal notes."</p>
