         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>James Rowland Angell was born in Burlington, Vermont, on May 8, 1869. Shortly afterwards his family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father, James Burrill Angell, became President of the University of Michigan. As a young boy he accompanied his father on a trip around the world and spent a year and a half in China. James was the youngest of three children; his sister, Lois, was six years his senior and his brother, Alexis, twelve.</p>
         <p>After graduating from the Ann Arbor public schools in 1886, he entered the University of Michigan where he received his A.B. degree in 1890. Although during his freshman year he followed the classical course, as an upperclassman he elected work in philosophy and psychology. He continued these studies as a graduate student at the University of Michigan and, under the guidance of John Dewey, received his M.A. degree with philosophy as a major and economics and American history as minors. In 1891 he left Michigan to work under William James at Harvard. He went to Germany the following year where he studied at the universities of Berlin and Halle and completed a Ph.D. thesis in German on Kant. Before receiving his degree, Mr. Angell returned to the United States to assume a teaching position at the University of Minnesota. His teaching career was continued at the University of Chicago where, in 1904, he was promoted to a professorship in experimental psychology. In 1911 he became Dean of the Faculties and, after a brief period in Washington during World War I, became Acting President of the University of Chicago. At the end of the war, he was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences and was appointed Chairman of the National Research Council. He was invited to become President of the Carnegie Corporation in 1920. Mr. Angell was also editor of Psychological Monographs from 1912 to 1922.</p>
         <p>When the Yale Corporation approached him with the offer of the Yale Presidency in 1921, they broke a two century tradition of selecting only Yale graduates for that office. During the sixteen years of Angell's Presidency, the Yale School of Nursing, the Department of Drama, the Institute of Human Relations, the Yale Observatory at Johannesburg, and many important professorships came into being. Under the direction of his shrewd business judgement, the university endowment funds increased fourfold and building programs affecting Yale's library, gym, art gallery, law school and medical school were undertaken. Angell's years as Yale's President were outstanding for their educational leadership as well as their able administration.</p>
         <p>After retiring from Yale in 1937, Mr. Angell became educational consultant for the National Broadcasting Company. In the years which followed he continued his interest in Yale, became a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and, after 1944, a director of the Hall of Fame.</p>
         <p>During his career as educator and psychologist, Mr. Angell was active in numerous organizations, wrote several books and received many awards. His membership in associations included the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Psychological Association, the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Science, the English-Speaking Union, Phi Beta Kappa, Delta Kappa Epsilon and Kappa Delta Pi. <title render="italic">
               Psychology
            </title>, his first book, was followed by <title render="italic">
               Chapters in Modern Psychology
            </title> in 1911, <title render="italic">
               Introduction to Psychology
            </title> in 1913 and <title render="italic">
               American Education
            </title> in 1937. Mr. Angell also wrote many articles in scientific journals. Among the honors he received were the French Legion of Honor and the Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy.</p>
         <p>James Rowland Angell married Marion Isabel Watrous in 1894. Their son, James Waterhouse Angell, is a noted economist, and their daughter, Marion, the former wife of William Rockefeller McAlpin. After Mrs. Angell's death in 1931, Mr. Angell was married to Katherine Cramer Woodman. They resided at 155 Blake Road, Hamden, Connecticut, until Mr. Angell's death in 1949.</p>

               <p>The correspondence is divided into two subseries: Family Correspondence and General Correspondence.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Family Correspondence</emph> consists of letters to James Rowland Angell from members of his family between 1880 and 1947 and of correspondence of members of James Rowland Angell's family with relatives and personal friends between 1891 and 1910.</p>
               <p>The letters to James Rowland Angell from family members do not include replies from him, except for a letter written to Marion Watrous, his fiancée and subsequent wife, in 1890, a folder of letters he sent to her from chicago in 1909, and a few other letters and telegrams. The letters are arranged by the names of Mr. Angell's correspondents, which are listed in a genealogical sequence according to their relationship to James Rowland Angell. A major portion of the letters are from his father, James B. Angell, written between 1891 and 1910 (19 folders), his mother, Sarah S. C. Angell, between 1890 and 1903 (16 folders), and his wife, Marion Angell, from 1890 to 1921 (29 folders). At the end of the letters for each of these correspondents is a folder containing letters for which no year has been indicated or fragments of letters whose dates are not known. In the correspondence
from his mother and wife, letters which exclude the month and/or the day, but not the year in which they were written, are included at the end of the folder for that particular year. Several letters of this type were received from his wife in 1909 and are grouped together in folder 80. A folder of unidentified family letters ranging from 1891 to 1935 is enclosed in folder 92.</p>
               <p>The correspondence of James Rowland Angell's family with relatives and personal friends includes a group of letters addressed to Mrs. Sarah Angell which contains correspondence from her brother, Thomas Thompson Caswell, her sister-in-law, Harriet B. Caswell, and a personal friend, E.A. Shepard. The other group of letters were written to Marion Angell. Most of these were from Sarah and James B. Angell; the remainder were sent by her sister-in-law, Lois Angell McLaughlin, her brother, Phillip Watrous and from three personal friends.</p>
               <p>Letters written by the family of his second wife, Katherine Angell during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were originally included in this series. However, since she did not marry Mr. Angell until 1934 and these letters had no references to him or to his family, the correspondence was returned to Mrs. Katherine Angell in February, 1969.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">General Correspondence</emph> is arranged alphabetically by the name of the institution or individual corresponding with James Rowland Angell. This alphabetical sequence also includes letters whose contents deal with some subject, such as the biographical sketch of Mr. Angell, and letters from abroad, listed according to the name of the country from which they were sent. The letters within the folders are organized chronologically with two exceptions: correspondence with foreign countries is arranged under the name of the country in alphabetical order according to the names of individual correspondents, and the individual authors and editors of monographs to be published by the Psychological Review Company are listed alphabetically under "Psychological Monographs" Material other than letters — such as minutes, announcements, reports and programs —are located at the end of the folder or, if numerous, contained in additional folders following the correspondence. Letters whose authors could not be identified are located in folder 306.</p>
               <p>The contents of the letters concern Mr. Angell's personal and professional activities before, during and after his Presidency at Yale. Among the earlier letters are those from prominent colleagues such as Charles Bakewell, John Dewey, Alfred S. Hodden, William James and A. H. Pierce. The correspondence listed under Yale University includes the numerous congratulatory letters he received upon his election in 1921, which are filed according to the date they were written and followed by a folder of Mr. Angell's replies. Although not all of the congratulatory letters were answered, Mr. Angell's secretary indicated in pencil on the original letter the date the response was written. The material concerning his retirement is divided into several topics, such as personal tributes and parties held in honor of Mr. Angell.</p>

               <p>James Rowland Angell's writings are arranged according to their specific type. The first in the series are the manuscripts of the thesis on imagery which he presented to the University of Michigan for a M.A. degree in philosophy in 1891 and the thesis on Kant, written in German, which he submitted to the University of Halle in 1895. An incomplete manuscript copy and a typescript copy of his book, <title render="italic">
                     Elements of Psychology
                  </title>, completed in 1904, are followed by a number of articles, including one he wrote as chairman of the National Research Council in 1920 and one which appeared in the <title render="italic">
                     American Journal of Sociology
                  </title> in 1941. A book review of Mr. Angell's <title render="italic">
                     Chapters from Modern Psychology
                  </title> (1912) from the <title render="italic">
                     Yale Review
                  </title> is included in this series as well as a review, written in French, of Mr. Angell's work, <title render="italic">
                     The Relation of Structural and Functional Psychology to Philosophy
                  </title>. Several of Mr. Angell's speeches from 1918 to 1942 are arranged in three groups as printed, typed, and incomplete. His scholarly notes, those used in the preparation of lectures and speeches, are presented separately from the miscellaneous notes found among his papers.</p>

               <p>The vast number of newspaper clippings relate to Mr. Angell's inauguration as Yale's President. These are divided into mounted, unmounted and headline pages accompanied by the remainder of the paper. A smaller group of clippings from after 1921 are arranged together in a separate folder. Clippings from periodicals and numerous family and academic photographs complete the series.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This addition consists of copies of materials produced by two related organizations, the General Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation. The provenance of these materials is not clear, but several factors suggest that the papers belonged to James R. Angell. The minutes which form the bulk of the papers cover only the years in which Angell served on the boards of these organizations, and the two reports, issued by committees on which he served, have his name penciled on them. More importantly, the one letter in the papers is addressed to Angell.</p>
               <p>The history and purpose of the General Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation (and their relationship to two other Rockefeller foundations, the International Education Board and the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial) are explained in the report in folder 34. As this report explains, the late 1920s and early 1930s - the period covered by this addition - were a time of redefinition for these groups. In 1928 a new objective was defined. Thereafter the Rockefeller Foundation supported research projects in the social sciences, the natural sciences, the medical sciences, and the humanities, while the General Education Board also pursued additional objectives of its own: to promote the reorganization of "general education" in the United States; to promote research in child growth and development; to stimulate the use of investigative experience as an educational tool; and to improve the quality of higher education for women and blacks in the South and newer states. The minutes here document the implementation of these programs.</p>
               <p>In this addition, the General Education Board materials run from May 1927 to December 1934. James R. Angell was already a member and trustee before and throughout this period. He also served on the Executive Committee from October 1932 to December 1934; and on the committee which produced the report in folder 10.</p>
               <p>The Rockefeller Foundation materials begin in November 1928, when Angell was already a member and trustee, and end abruptly in March 1936, although Angell's involvement apparently continued longer. He became an alternate member of the Executive Committee in April 1932, and a member of it in October 1932.</p>
               <p>Some materials, especially the reports, have been annotated in pencil, presumably by Angell. Markers in some of the minutes indicate some of the discussions relevant to Yale; in particular, support for Robert M. Yerkes' anthropoid breeding station, and for Ross Granville Harrison's researches in experimental embryology.</p>
               <p>Further Rockefeller Foundation materials will be found in Series II of the Angell Papers; and further materials concerning both organizations will be found in Angell's presidential papers, YRG 2-A-14.</p>
