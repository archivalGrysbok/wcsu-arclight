         <abstract id="aspace_799151422688bf3e0509aa5f623eb19a">The papers consist of correspondence, diaries, ships' logs, notebooks, writings, speeches, and legal and financial papers documenting Wilfred T. Grenfell's medical missionary work in Labrador, particularly for the years 1930-1940. Also included are scattered papers of the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen and the Grenfell Associations, containing correspondence, minutes, financial records and reports (1893-1949). The small amount of papers of Ann MacClanahan Grenfell, his wife, consist largely of correspondence related to the Grenfell Association and two travel diaries (1924-1926). Grenfell's correspondence, notebooks and diaries are a valuable source for Labrador and Newfoundland history, as well as economic and social conditions between 1892, when he committed himself to missionary work in Labrador, and his death in 1940. There are also family papers relating to both the Grenfell and MacClanahan families. Providing an overall view of Grenfell's life are twenty-one scrapbooks (1893-1939) and a collection of nearly 10,500 photographs of life in Newfoundland and Labrador (1890-1940), of various missions and views of the Grenfell's travels to other parts of the world (1891-1932).</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Wilfred T. Grenfell Papers contain primarily the personal and professional papers of Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell, medical missionary to Newfoundland and Labrador. From 1892 on, Grenfell devoted his life to his Labrador work, and both his professional and personal papers reflect his dedication to this work. Both deal with economic and social problems in Labrador and with the remedies Grenfell sought to administer through the work of his Grenfell Associations. In addition, both are infused with Grenfell's strong religious beliefs, which demanded action to better man's condition.</p>

         <p>At the beginning of the folder list for each series is a description which gives more information about the contents and arrangements of that series.</p>
         <p>The papers are especially useful for studying aspects of Newfoundland and Labrador history, economy and sociology between 1892 and 1940. Letters to his family provide detailed narratives of his life and work in Labrador, as well as frequent expressions of his religious and political views. In general, the papers stress W.T. Grenfell's role as a missionary rather than his role as a doctor. The administrative and financial aspects of the Grenfell Association permeate the entire collection, while the number of medical papers is surprisingly small. Almost half the collection dates between 1930 and 1940.</p>
         <p>There is some material, mostly correspondence, dating from Grenfell's childhood and education. However, his volunteer service as a major with the Harvard Surgical Unit in France during World War I is the only other relatively well documented period of his life. See outgoing correspondence 1941-15 (Series I), and his diary (Series II), writings (Series V) and memorabilia (Series XIII) for material regarding his World War I experiences.</p>
         <p>At the beginning of his career in Newfoundland, Grenfell worked for the R.N.M.D.S.F. (Royal National Mission To Deep Sea Fishermen), a British charitable organization devoted to the welfare of British sailors of the North Sea and Grand Banks fleets, and served as a justice of the peace. Many of his administrative papers (Series I, outgoing), and a smaller amount of material from other R.N.M.D.S.F. officials (Series X) are preserved here, as well as some legal papers (Series VII). All of these provide a picture of the organization, spiced with the personality conflicts endemic to any organization, and of the poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, and other economic and social problems of Newfoundland and Labrador which the R.N.M.D.S.F. was attempting to rectify.</p>
         <p>Papers relating to the Grenfell Association are also an important source of information on Newfoundland and Labrador. Grenfell founded this organization in 1912 to help him raise funds for his Labrador work, administer those funds and the newly founded facilities, and attract volunteers ("Wops" or "With-out-pay") to the area as teachers, doctors, and agricultural advisors. In the process of administering the Grenfell Association, W.T. Grenfell came in contact with important government officials of Newfoundland and Canada, and with many major philanthropists. As a result there is a fair amount of correspondence (Series I) from figures such as William Lyon MacKenzie King and the governors of Newfoundland and a lesser amount concerning various philanthropical activities from Henry Ford, John Rockefeller, Albert Schweitzer and others.</p>
         <p>Aside from purely administrative and philanthropical matters, W.T. Grenfell involved himself in numerous projects connected in one way or another with the welfare of Labrador. Among these was the establishment of a reindeer herd for transportation and nutrition purposes, and the use of cellulose acetate in tuberculosis sanataria. (See series I, V, XI, XIV)</p>
         <p>Grenfell adamantly believed in the positive part religion should play in the eradication of suffering from the modern world. His writings and speeches (Series V, VI) promote temperance societies in industrial countries and encourage support for basic medical, educational, and economic aid to the poorer nations. He often expressed the view that the poor could help themselves if they were given employment rather than charity. Through the Grenfell Association he promoted the establishment of cottage industries as well as larger projects such as sawmills in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
         <p>A particular strength of the Grenfell Papers is the large photograph collection. Almost 10,500 photographs taken by W.T. Grenfell, his family and colleagues provide a visual record of Newfoundland and Labrador between 1890 and 1940, and of Eskimo and Indian inhabitants and European settlers. Interesting from a biographical standpoint is a long series of photographs stretching from W.T. Grenfell's grandparents to his grandchildren which closely detail his own life from 1873 to 1940 and that of his wife and children.</p>
         <p>Throughout the papers W.T. Grenfell and his family are referred to by their initials, a practice followed by them in their correspondence and in annotations on photographs. The abbreviations used are:</p>

         <p>The vast bulk of the papers were given to the Yale University Library by W. T. Grenfell's three children, W.T. Grenfell, Jr., Kinloch Pascoe Grenfell, and Rosamond (Grenfell) Shaw over the period 1943-1980.</p>
         <p>Other related collections in Manuscripts and Archives are The New England Grenfell Association Papers (Mss. #1200) and the Elizabeth Paige Harris Papers (Mss. #771). Elizabeth (Paige) Harris was a volunteer worker for the Grenfell Association in White Bay, Newfoundland, for several years, and thereafter worked occasionally on fund raising and other matters in the United States.

               <p>This series is divided into two sections, <emph render="italic">Outgoing</emph> and <emph render="italic">Incoming</emph>. Since letters to Anne E.M. Grenfell were sometimes answered by W.T. Grenfell and vice versa, her correspondence (Series VIII) should be consulted in conjunction with this series.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Outgoing</emph> contains letters written by W.T. Grenfell on both personal and business matters. The letters are arranged chronologically with undated letters filed at the end of the section. While there are letters for earlier periods in Grenfell's life, letters from the decade 1930-1940 comprise almost half of the section.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Incoming</emph> is composed of letters received by W.T. Grenfell. It includes all business and family letters, but excludes printed invitations, which are found in Series XIII. The letters are arranged in alphabetical order by correspondent, and letters by the same correspondent have been arranged chronologically. Correspondence from unidentified sources follows at the end of the section, in chronological order. Letters from especially noted individuals, such as Albert Schweitzer, along with those of major correspondents (10 or more items), are foldered separately by the name of the correspondent and placed at the end of the appropriate letter of the alphabet. Letters from government officials are to be found under the country and office they represent, e.g. Newfoundland, Governor's Office. Correspondence from R.N.M.D.S.F. and Grenfell Association workers is to be found under the name of the individual.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series contains works written by W.T. Grenfell. It is divided into six sections: <emph render="italic">Books</emph>, <emph render="italic">Articles and Essays</emph>, <emph render="italic">Pamphlets and Leaflets</emph>, <emph render="italic">Reports</emph>, <emph render="italic">notes</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Other</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Books</emph> consists of drafts and partial drafts, arranged chronologically, for several of Grenfell's books, in particular his autobiography <emph render="italic">A Labrador Doctor</emph>, and his national and political history of Labrador, <emph render="italic">The Romance of Labrador</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Articles and Essays</emph> includes a wide selection of Grenfell's magazine and newspaper articles and letters to the editor. The majority are semi-autobiographical and deal with Grenfell's conversion to active Christianity and with his subsequent work in Labrador. Other frequent topics include world politics and man's need for faith.</p>
               <p>This section is arranged in chronological order, followed by undated works arranged alphabetically by title. Both works in draft form and printed copies are included in this section.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Pamphlets and Leaflets</emph> consists of a small number of works, almost all of which Grenfell wrote for the Grenfell Association. In most of these Grenfell merges autobiography with the history of the association. Also present is Grenfell's "catechism" for Labrador school children written to promote personal hygiene. The section is arranged chronologically.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Reports</emph>, also in chronological order, consists of a few descriptions of ship wrecks and administrative reports for the RNMDSF and the Grenfell Association.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">notes</emph>, arranged chronologically, consists of informal jottings on varied subjects, many of which may have been made in preparation for one or more books or article.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Other</emph> includes Grenfell's poems and reviews as well as a set of directions for the administration of the Grenfell Association after his death. This series is arranged in chronological order.</p>

               <p>The papers of Anne Elizabeth Caldwell (MacClanahan) Grenfell have been collected into a separate series in recognition of the important role she played in the administration of the Grenfell Association (W.T. Grenfell referred to her as "the business brain"). It is unfortunate that only such a small amount of material is available here.</p>
               <p>The series is divided into <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="italic">Travel Diaries</emph>, <emph render="italic">Writings and Public Speaking</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Legal and Financial Papers</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> comprises the majority of this series, and more than three quarters of the letters date from 1930-1938. Most of the correspondence concerns Grenfell Association business, though some personal letters, especially from Rosamond A. (Hill) MacClanahan, her mother, are included.</p>
               <p>This series is divided into outgoing, arranged chronologically, and incoming, arranged alphabetically by author. Letters from especially noted individuals and major correspondents (10 or more items) are foldered separately by author and placed at the end of the appropriate letter of the alphabet.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Travel Diaries</emph>, arranged chronologically, consists of diaries from a world tour in 1924-1925 and an English tour in 1926.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings and Public Speaking</emph> contains only the texts of one article and one radio broadcast.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Legal and Financial Papers</emph> contains a small quantity of material arranged in chronological order.</p>
               <p>Additional papers of A.E. Grenfell are scattered through other series. See Series I for all of A.E. Grenfell's letters to and from W.T. Grenfell. See also papers in Series IX, X, and XII.</p>

Correspondence is arranged chronologically. (All letters between W. T. Grenfell and Grenfell Associations are in Series I, those to or from A. E. Grenfell in Series VIII, and those to or from other Grenfell family members in Series XII.) The remaining material, arranged chronologically by type, includes minutes, reports, financial papers, subject files, and miscellaneous papers.

               <p>THIRD PARTY contains miscellaneous correspondence, writings, and speeches generated by persons other than W. T. Grenfell, his family, or officials of the RNMDSF or the Grenfell Association. The series is divided into three sections, <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph>, <emph render="italic">Writings</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Public Speaking</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Correspondence</emph> is arranged chronologically. Included is a large group of letters in praise of Grenfell which were solicited by Dr. Clarence J. Blake in 1915 to counter adverse publicity about the Grenfell Association.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Writings</emph> is divided into books, articles and essays, pamphlets and leaflets, reports, poems, and other, with each subsection being arranged chronologically. The material preserved here appears to be that which Grenfell kept as his reference files and includes writings about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Public Speaking</emph> is arranged chronologically. It contains addresses made in honor of W. T. Grenfell, or for special occasions such as the opening of the new hospital in St. Anthony, Newfoundland.</p>

               <p>MEMORABILIA is divided into four sections: <emph render="italic">Scrapbooks</emph>, <emph render="italic">Newspaper</emph>
                  <emph render="italic">Clippings</emph>, <emph render="italic">Maps and Drawings</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Other</emph>.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Scrapbooks</emph> includes 21 chronologically arranged volumes of correspondence, newspaper clippings, certificates, and other memorabilia compiled by Grenfell and his family. In 1979 these fragile volumes were preserved on four reels of microfilm. Correspondence and important documents were then removed and filed in the appropriate series, and the original scrapbooks were destroyed. The researcher interested in seeing the scrapbooks should consult HM 80, Series I, Reels 1-4.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Newspaper Clippings</emph> is arranged chronologically. Most of the contents concern Grenfell and/or Labrador.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Maps and Drawings</emph> contains works by W.T. Grenfell and by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Other</emph> includes a tape-recorded interview with Wilfred Mesher, who worked with Grenfell; programs; announcements of lectures; printed invitations; and timetables, as well as other miscellaneous items.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>Almost 10,500 photographs, mostly of Labrador and Newfoundland, have been arranged by location or by subject in this series. They provide a pictorial history from 1890-1940 of many Newfoundland and Labrador towns and a graphic portrayal of the economic hardship of the region. There is also a record of W.T. Grenfell and his family throughout their lives and a survey of his friends and associates.</p>
               <p>The photographs were originally mounted in albums, but they have now been removed and placed in envelopes. Each photograph and envelope bears a number such as 1-1-60, i.e. box 1, folder 1, photograph 60. All annotations from the albums have been copied onto the envelopes and keyed to the photographs by the numbers written on them. A large number of photographs had no annotation, and tentative identifications, indicated by square brackets, have been made wherever possible. Several albums could not be dismantled. Photographs in these albums were photocopied and the copies then filed in the appropriate sections. Because these albums are in poor condition they may only be used after the copies have been consulted.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph render="italic">Mission Stations</emph> contains photographs of locations in Newfoundland and Labrador where the Grenfell Association has hospitals, schools, or other facilities. The photographs are arranged alphabetically by place name and then chronologically. Whenever there are many photographs for one location, they have been further divided by topic, for instance "Hospital" or "Liv'eres" (the year-round residents of Newfoundland and Labrador). Within each topic photographs are chronologically arranged. Many of the <emph render="italic">Collateral Families</emph>contains photographs of other family members, arranged chronologically by family.</p>
