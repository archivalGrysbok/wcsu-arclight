         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Stephen Gendin, a prominent HIV/AIDS activist and writer, was born on February 20, 1966, and raised in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Growing up, Gendin was a straight-A student and was very active with the Boy Scouts of America, earning the distinction of National Explorer Scout of the Year as a teenager. He graduated as valedictorian of Ypsilanti High School in 1984, and attended college at Brown University.</p>
         <p>During his freshman year at Brown, Gendin tested positive for HIV, which sparked his lifelong commitment to HIV/AIDS activism. He was an early member of the direct action advocacy group, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), founded in New York in 1987. Gendin served on ACT UP/New York's fundraising committee, and founded ACT UP/Rhode Island that same year. As a member of ACT UP, Gendin took part in a number of demonstrations and civil disobedience actions, and was arrested several times. Also in 1987, Gendin was selected as the youngest member of the executive committee of the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. In 1989, Gendin established ACT UP's <title render="italic">
               Treatment and Data Digest
            </title>, a pioneering newsletter designed to disseminate information on HIV/AIDS medications and treatments. That same year, Gendin completed a bachelor's degree in religious studies at Brown. He later completed two years toward a master's degree at the Union Theological Seminary.</p>
         <p>During the 1990s, after a second large wave of HIV/AIDS infections impacted gay men, Gendin co-founded two advocacy organizations: the AIDS Prevention Action League (APAL), and Sex Panic!. These groups were formed largely in reaction to both mainstream political efforts and arguments within the gay community that promoted monogamy, the closing of sex clubs, and the demonization of public sex culture and promiscuity as the best ways to prevent HIV/AIDS. In contrast, these groups argued for the promotion of safe sex practices to prevent infection and against the shaming and marginalization of sexual practices that some considered deviant. During this time he also co-founded the Community Prescription Service, a mail-order business that sold FDA-approved prescription drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, in addition to disseminating information on new and upcoming treatments through newsletters and community forums.</p>
         <p>Stephen Gendin achieved perhaps his greatest notoriety during the 1990s as a columnist for <title render="italic">
               POZ Magazine
            </title>, a publication devoted to documenting the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the lives of people affected by it. In his columns, Gendin wrote candidly about the struggles and indignities of living with and treating HIV and AIDS, and occasionally stirred controversy. Among Gendin's most infamous columns were one in which he discussed his conflicted feelings about knowingly engaging in unprotected sex after having been infected with HIV, and another in which he fantasized about assassinating US Senator Jesse Helms.</p>
         <p>Throughout his adult life, Gendin tried various treatments and medications for HIV/AIDS as soon as they became available, but eventually the particular strain of the virus that had infected him became resistant to all medications. Stephen Gendin died of complications due to AIDS-related lymphoma on July 19, 2000.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series comprises a variety of materials documenting Stephen Gendin's personal and family life from his childhood until his death at age 34. Correspondence in the series consists of letters written to Gendin by friends, partners, lovers, and relatives. Gendin's journals and personal writings provide great insight into his formative teenage and early adult years, particularly his coming out and identity as a gay man. In his early journals, Gendin writes about coming out to his family and friends during high school, as well as his experiences and feelings about being an openly gay teenager during the early 1980s. During his teenage years, Gendin also started writing frankly in his journal about his own sexuality and sexual experiences, a theme that would eventually carry over into his work for <title render="italic">
                     POZ Magazine
                  </title>, where he was known for often writing candidly about his sex life. In Gendin's Sex Journal, compiled during the late-1990s, he individually lists and describes most, if not all of his sexual encounters and partners dating back to 1982.   
 
After high school, Gendin's journal writing became more inconsistent. In journals dating from his college years, Gendin writes primarily about romantic and sexual experiences, his studies, and makes only occasional references to his contraction of HIV and his increasing involvement in HIV/AIDS activism. Only a few pages of journal writing from his post-college years are included in the papers. Also included in Gendin's personal writings are poems that he wrote for Kyle "Hush" McDowell, his partner from 1996 until his death; an essay on an experience at a gay dance club called The Saint; and a piece titled "Unnamed Magazine," which is handwritten and roughly laid out like a magazine, but does not appear to be a template for an actual publication.    
  
Gendin's student files include papers and assignments completed while he was a student at Ypsilanti High School, at Brown University, and during his graduate studies at the Union Theological Seminary.  Also included are copies of Gendin's college applications; awards and scholarships he received when he graduated high school; college transcripts; and papers related to job searches both during and right after college. Photographs in the collection date primarily from the 1990s, and consist mostly of snapshots of Gendin and his friends at social functions, and on vacations and trips abroad. Some of these photographs appear to have been taken at Gay Pride events in New York City. There are also a number of nude photographs of Gendin, many of which appear to be self-portraits, and some of which feature vivid depictions of sexual acts.</p>
               <p>Family photographs in the collection include a Gendin family photograph album as well as some loose photographs. There are many photographs of Stephen Gendin, his sister, Margo, and his parents dating from his childhood.  There are also a number of photographs of Gendin's parents dating back to their childhoods, as well as photographs of other relatives dating back to the 1920s. Gendin's personal papers also include audio recordings of some of his outgoing telephone answering machine messages. Gendin was known by his family, friends and colleagues for recording lengthy, stream-of-consciousness outgoing messages that featured updates on his life and other musings.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Stephen Gendin's personal papers feature a variety of materials related to his death, including copies of his death certificate and will; sympathy cards, letters, and print-outs of emails sent to Gendin's partner, Hush McDowell; materials from Gendin's memorial service, including a guestbook; and several copies of the October 2000 issue of <title render="italic">
                     POZ Magazine
                  </title>, which was dedicated to Gendin's memory. The issue featured five different covers with photographs of Gendin, as well as written tributes by many of his friends and colleagues.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>HIV/AIDS activism papers document various aspcects of Stephen Gendin's career as an advocate for HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment. Clippings in the collection date mostly from the late 1980s and document direct action protests organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), many of which Gendin participated in. Relatedly, the papers also include records pertaining to Gendin's several arrests for civil disobedience actions as a member of ACT UP. These arrests occured mostly at protests in New York City and the Washington, DC area. The papers also include several years' worth of address and appointment books, both of which are illustrative of Gendin's day-to-day work life, as well as the network he cultivated and utilized as an activist.</p>
               <p>The largest single body of documents in this series consists of handwritten notes by Gendin, written mostly on yellow legal pads. The notes date primarily from the 1990s, and though Gendin's note-taking style and organizational structure were highly idiosyncratic, the content of the notes suggests that they mostly relate to his work with <title render="italic">
                     POZ Magazine
                  </title> and the Community Prescription Service (CPS). The notes, in fact, contain the most extensive documentation of CPS contained in the collection, detailing its development and day-to-day operations. There are also a great many notes related to HIV/AIDS-related issues whose context within the scope of Gendin's work is not readily discernible.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the series includes files pertaining to HIV/AIDS activist organizations with which Gendin was affiliated. The types of documents contained in these files include fliers; clippings; newsletters; meeting minutes and agendas; contact lists, audio and video recordings; and correspondence.</p>
