         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These papers encompass the activities of the Hartford and Connecticut chapters of the CDAAA between 1940 and 1941 (mostly 1941). Materials pertaining to this organization comprises two-thirds of the collection; the other third consists of materials relating to John Danaher and the Danaher McMahon senatorial contest (Connecticut 1944). The principals of the collection are Walter E. Batterson and Mrs. Arthur V.R. Tilton (Eleanor Taft). In addition there is some correspondence of H.M. Dadourian and material relating to other organizations of the early and mid-forties.</p>
         <p>The papers are divided into four series: Correspondence, Speeches and Writings, Subject Files, and Printed Matter.</p>
         <p>The National Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies was organized in May, 1940 for the purpose of influencing public opinion and lobbying in favor of United States assistance to the allied powers. William Allen White, an influential Kansas editor, and Clark Mell Eichelberger were prime movers in organizing the CDAAA and served respectively as national chairman. White resigned January 4, 1941. Hence, most of the material pertaining to the national organization in this collection involves Clark Eichelberger. The national CDAAA was prointervention, lobbied in favor of the Lend-Lease Bill, recognition of DeGaulle's government in exile, against the neutrality act, and against the propaganda of the America First group. The national organization is chiefly represented in this collection through correspondence and published material in the "Printed Matter" series.</p>
         <p>The Hartford chapter of the CDAAA was organized soon after the national headquarters was established and followed the general national policy. The chairman of the Hartford chapter was Walter E. Batterson a former mayor of that city. With the emergence of a state organization he served similtaneously as the chairman of the Connecticut and Hartford chapters. Batterson retained these two positions until October, 1941 when the state CDAAA merged with an organization of similar purpose, Fight for Freedom Inc. He then served as a co-chairman of the new organization, Fight for Freedom Committee to Defend America, while H. M. Dadourian headed the Hartford organization. The activities of the committees stopped shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.</p>
         <p>Eleanor Taft Tilton was active in both the state and local CDAAA. She served as a vice-chairman of the Hartford chapter and as a member of the state committee-at-large. She was also secretary of Americans United for World Organization in the mid-forties and worked in opposition to the reelection of John Danaher in 1944.</p>
         <p>John Danaher, Republican Senator from Connecticut 1939-1945 is the subject of a portion of the material in this collection. Danaher's votes against such acts as the Naval Appropriations Bill, the Selective Service Act and the Lend-Lease Bill made him one of the chief congressional opponents of the program that the CDAAA wanted to promote. The CDAAA opposed Danaher's opinions through meetings, press statements, and letters to the editor. Material related to the anti-Danaher campaign is present in each series of the collection, but is primarily found in "Speeches and Writings", "Subject Files", and "Printed Matter."</p>

               <p>CORRESPONDENCE is divided into four subsections: the first three subsections consist of the correspondence of the principals of the collection—Walter E. Batterson, H. M. Dadourian, and Eleanor T. Tilton; the last section consists of correspondence of others. Within each subsection the correspondence is arranged alphabetically. The first and largest subsection is the correspondence of Walter E. Batterson (1940-1941). Batterson corresponded with most of Connecticut's congressional representatives and officials of pro and anti-intervention groups. His correspondence also includes letters with CDAAA national headquarters and letters to the editors of various publications.</p>
               <p>The second subsection, the correspondence of H. M. Dadourian, and the third subsection, the correspondence of Eleanor Taft Tilton, are smimilar in content to the Batterson correspondence, but smaller. Mrs. Tilton's correspondence includes some letters relating to the Danaher-McMahon contest for the Senate in 1944.</p>
