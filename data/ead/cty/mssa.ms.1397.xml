         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Henry Fitzhugh Papers consist of correspondence and legal and financial paers documenting Fitzhugh's business affairs and the management of his estate. The earliest materials concern his project to import military supplies from England to aid the Confederacy during the Civil War. A letterpress copybook from this period contains copies of his letters written from England to his business associates and to his sisters, as well as a copy of a memorandum on America sent to the British Foreign Office.</p>
         <p>The bulk of the papers, including a second letterpress copybook and a margins book, comes from Fitzhugh's postwar career as a banker in New York. Other materials document his involvement in a mining venture in Mexico, his personal accounts, and his estate. About half of the incoming correspondence consists of family letters.</p>
         <p>Other individuals represented in the collection include his mother, Henrietta Fitzhugh; his maternal uncle, Henry W. Fitzhugh; his brother, George N. Fitzhugh; and his nephew, Archie M. Quarrier.</p>
         <p>The papers were given to the Yale Library by Fitzhugh Quarrier in October, 1984. They are arranged in Alphabetical order by record type.</p>

         <p>Henry Fitzhugh was born in Charleston, West Virginia, in 1831, the son of Henry Fitzhugh and Henrietta (Fitzhugh) Fitzhugh. He was educated at Marietta College, Ohio, and practiced law in Charleston before becoming president of the Bank of Kanawha. During the Civil War Fitzhugh served as a colonel in the army of the Confederate States of America and engaged in procuring and managing steamers for blockade running. Steamers travelled to England with various goods and returned with military supplies for the War Department of the Confederate States. In 1863, on one such voyage, Fitzhugh was captured, but was able later to complete his journey to England, where he continued his services for the Confederacy. At the end of the war he went to Mexico in connection with a successful mining venture. In 1867 he moved to New York, and remained there for the rest of his life. He worked for the banking house of Soutter &amp; Company, formed the banking house of Fitzhugh &amp; Stewart, and was a director of the Chicago Gas Trust Company. He died in 1890, unmarried.</p>
