         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Abe Fortas was born in 1910 in Memphis, Tennessee, to a working-class Orthodox Jewish family. He was educated in Memphis's public schools, and became well known locally playing the violin in a number of bands. He left high school early and enrolled at Southwestern College at Memphis, a school affiliated with the Presbyterian Church, from which he graduated first in his class in 1930. A leading Memphis family in the Jewish community, with connections to the Yale Law School, provided Fortas with a scholarship to that institution. He received his LL.B. degree in 1933, graduating near the top of his class and having been elected editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. Immediately upon graduating, Fortas was invited to take a position as a teaching fellow at the Yale Law School, and was eventually appointed assistant professor of law in 1936. He held this position until 1938, teaching courses in business law and corporate finance, often working alongside his mentors and colleagues, including then Sterling Professor of Law William O. Douglas, and future law partner Thurman Arnold. At the same time that Fortas was teaching, he had a small legal and consulting practice in New Haven.</p>
         <p>Fortas was at the Yale Law School during the early, powerful years of the school of thought known as "legal realism," and is generally considered a legal realist in his legal, judicial, and political philosophies. In addition to his teaching and law practice, from 1933 to 1938 Fortas found himself at the center of New Deal activities in Washington, and served in a series of positions at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Works Administration, and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Fortas often took leaves of absence from teaching at Yale to devote himself to government service and was considered one of the Roosevelt administration's leading and most promising young figures. In 1935, he married Carolyn Eugenia Agger, another young New Dealer, who had also been his student at the Yale Law School.</p>
         <p>In 1938, Fortas resigned from the law school faculty and accepted a series of full-time New Deal appointments, eventually becoming under secretary of the Department of the Interior in 1942. Once World War II began, and after repeated requests to be allowed to serve in the military were denied by Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes and also by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (both of whom considered Fortas too valuable in his current position to take a military assignment), Fortas was finally given leave by Ickes and Roosevelt to resign. Fortas immediately enlisted in the United States Navy as an apprentice seaman in November 1943. He was highly enthusiastic about his service, and wrote colorfully of his experiences and his fellow enlistees, but was honorably discharged for an eye condition soon after reporting for duty. Fortas was subsequently reappointed by President Roosevelt to his still vacant position as under secretary.</p>
         <p>While under secretary, Fortas was the second highest ranking official in the Department of the Interior, serving closely alongside Secretary Ickes. Often, when Ickes was out of Washington, Fortas served as acting secretary, attending a number of heated wartime cabinet meetings, and undertaking numerous other cabinet-level functions. Fortas was involved with a broad range of issues, including power production and distribution, natural resource production and allocation domestically and abroad, and the status of inhabitants in American territories, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. He was particularly concerned with the difficult conditions facing Americans of Japanese descent in Hawaii under the martial law that was imposed following the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
         <p>After serving as a member of the United States delegation to the formative United Nations conferences, Fortas resigned from government service in 1946 to found the Washington, D.C. law firm of Arnold &amp; Fortas. His partner was Thurman W. Arnold, a former teacher and colleague at Yale, who worked as a Justice Department "trust buster," served as a federal judge, and was a widely read author. The firm soon became Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter, with the addition of former Federal Communication Commission Chairman Paul A. Porter. The law firm grew rapidly in reputation and power, as did Fortas's role in Washington life. Fortas and Arnold also returned to the Yale Law School to teach courses on business and antitrust law. Fortas was joined in practice by many future political figures, such as Joseph A. Califano, Jr., William D. Rogers, and James W. Symington, as well as by his wife, Carolyn Agger, a highly influential tax lawyer. In addition to representing many large corporate clients, the firm undertook the representation of many of those brought before various loyalty boards and congressional hearings during the "red scare" days of the late 1940s and early 1950s. These clients included Dorothy Bailey, José Ferrer, Owen Lattimore, and John Peters. The firm also represented Ezra Pound in his successful attempt to gain release from Saint Elizabeth's Hospital. Fortas served as appointed counsel in the landmark cases of Durham v. United States (in which the so-called M'Naghten rule for determining criminal insanity was assailed) and Gideon v. Wainwright (in which indigent defendants were given the right to counsel in state criminal felony trials). Fortas found himself appointed to argue these cases as a result of his long-standing advocacy for the rights of the criminally insane and the indigent. He was also a well-known and active opponent of the death penalty. During these years between the late 1940s and 1965, Fortas served as a trustee or director for a wide range of arts and cultural organizations and institutions, government committees, and corporations.</p>
         <p>Fortas was nominated as associate justice of the Supreme Court in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson. Fortas had known Johnson for many years, beginning when both were young New Dealers in Washington in the late 1930s. Fortas then successfully represented Johnson in his contested Senate election in 1948. Fortas drew on his personal relationship with Justice Hugo L. Black, who had supervisory jurisdiction in the federal courts of Texas, clearing the way for Johnson's election to the Senate. The relationship between Fortas and Johnson continued and deepened, with Fortas serving as a close and highly trusted legal, political, and cultural advisor. Fortas was a strong defender of President Johnson, including his often unpopular foreign policy, such as his escalation of American involvement in Vietnam. Despite Fortas's closeness to Johnson, Fortas was not easily persuaded to leave his successful and lucrative law practice to return to government service. President Johnson finally demanded that Fortas accept an appointment, and nominated Fortas to replace Justice Arthur J. Goldberg in the so-called "Jewish seat" on the Supreme Court. There was some skepticism on the part of the Senate that Johnson had nominated someone so closely and personally linked to himself, but Fortas was confirmed with little opposition.</p>
         <p>On the bench, Fortas was most often aligned with Chief Justice Earl Warren and the socially liberal wing of the Supreme Court. Fortas, who, unlike many justices, came to the Supreme Court without ever having served on a lower court, was well liked and respected by his colleagues. Fortas's greatest friend and ally on the Court was his old teacher and mentor, Justice William O. Douglas. From 1965 to 1968, many major cases came before the Supreme Court, on such subjects as anti-trust law, criminal law, labor law, the limits of free speech and obscenity, race and desegregation, and the Selective Service system. In the landmark case, In re Gault, Fortas authored the Court's opinion that began to extend to juvenile criminal defendants some of the same due process protections that were then provided to adult defendants. During his time on the Court, Fortas was a popular and often controversial public figure and lectured extensively around the country, particularly on college campuses. A committed social liberal who had lectured and published widely in the years prior to coming to the Supreme Court, he rarely shied away from speaking on the most contentious and divisive issues of the day. His short book, <title render="italic">
               Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience
            </title>, attempted to put the then raging campus protest movement in its historical and legal context.</p>
         <p>In June 1968, Fortas was nominated by President Johnson to be chief justice of the United States, in the wake of Earl Warren's planned retirement. The nomination of a close friend by Johnson, in the last months of his faltering administration, was greeted with strong opposition and controversy. Difficult confirmation hearings and eventually a filibuster in the Senate ensued. In October 1968, Fortas asked that his name be withdrawn from nomination. Activities uncovered during Fortas's nomination hearings, including his continued advisory role to President Johnson while Fortas was on the Supreme Court, and Fortas's relationship with convicted financier Louis E. Wolfson and Wolfson's charitable foundation, led to increasing pressure on Justice Fortas. He resigned from the Supreme Court in May 1969, becoming the first justice to do so under public pressure.</p>
         <p>Fortas returned to private practice with his own small firm in Washington, while also forming an association with a larger firm in Chicago. He originally hoped to rejoin the firm that he had founded, and was invited to do so by Thurman Arnold and a number of the older partners. He was not, however, welcomed by others. Fortas continued pursuing his extensive musical and cultural interests. Fortas's greatest commitment of time, and the institution to which he most closely associated himself, was the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Fortas was appointed to the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center by President Johnson in 1964, and Fortas remained a member of the board until his death. As a former professional musician and as someone who was associated with such musical luminaries as Pablo Casals and Isaac Stern, Fortas was a powerful advocate for the arts. He was intimately involved with the Kennedy Center, served on the executive committee of its board of trustees, and played a key role in nearly every aspect of the Center's operations. Fortas helped orchestrate extensive fund-raising efforts for the Kennedy Center, including the construction of the Studio or Terrace Theater (which now hosts the Fortas Chamber Music Concerts in his honor). With Roger L. Stevens and others, Fortas organized and directed Kennedy Center Productions, Inc., which brought significant revenues to the Kennedy Center and brought such works as "Annie"&#x9d; and "First Monday in October" to the stage and screen.</p>
         <p>In March 1982, Fortas presented oral arguments before the Supreme Court in a case involving a political controversy in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth that had long been one of the key focuses of his legal, political, and cultural lives. Fortas argued this case in front of some of his former colleagues. They now sat on a court that had become very different under the man who became chief justice instead of Fortas, Warren E. Burger. It was the first time that he had returned to the Supreme Court to argue a case since his resignation in 1969. Two weeks later, Abe Fortas died in Washington, D.C. on April 5, 1982.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Although Abe Fortas's early years in Memphis are not well documented in the papers, he kept exhaustive autobiographical files and there is significant family and other personal correspondence that speaks to his childhood and family history. The files related to the relationships Fortas developed as a student and teacher at the Yale Law School are extensive. Files on his service as under secretary of the Interior are complete, and include materials that detail Fortas's extraordinarily broad set of duties as Harold L. Ickes's chief deputy during World War II. Fortas's advocacy for the rights of those under martial law in Hawaii, and his role in dealing with natural resource issues both in the United States and abroad, are also meticulously documented.</p>
         <p>Materials on the early years of Fortas's move from government service to successful private legal practice can be found in correspondence to and from his legal associates. There are few materials on Fortas's early relationship with Lyndon Baines Johnson, including Fortas's role as Johnson's lawyer in the controversial 1948 Texas senatorial election. The files become more complete as their relationship continued and deepened, and Johnson rose to Senate majority leader, vice president, and president. Subject and correspondence files devoted to Johnson and to people or organizations associated with him demonstrate the role Fortas played as a close and highly trusted legal and political advisor, particularly in the Johnson White House. The papers also show that this close advisory relationship continued while Fortas was on the Supreme Court.</p>
         <p>The documentation from Fortas's four terms on the Supreme Court is extensive. The public and internal workings of the Court are clearly documented. The papers also disclose the generally cordial but sometimes contentious relationships between all the justices. Correspondence between justices demonstrate the fault lines that existed between the socially liberal, "activist" justices and their opponents in these final years of the Warren Court. Each step of the process of how a matter comes before the Supreme Court can be studied. Extensive correspondence that resulted from Fortas's nominations to the Court as both associate and chief justice, and his resignation, completes the in-depth picture of Fortas's time on the Court.</p>
         <p>Materials covering Fortas's post-Supreme Court years are especially valuable for documenting his involvement with the cultural institutions that he helped direct. There is, for example, a complete and thorough run of files documenting the history of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and Fortas's active participation as one of its leading trustees, from the Kennedy Center's founding until his death in 1982.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged chronologically, following each of the four "October Terms" that Fortas was on the Supreme Court, with correspondence related to the major events in Fortas's judicial career coming at the end of series. The papers provide extensive documentation of Justice Fortas's years on the Supreme Court. The process by which a case or controversy comes before the Supreme Court is complex and the materials documenting this process necessarily reflect this complexity. The materials contained within each term are divided into their constituent parts, largely reflecting the original order and purpose of these papers.</p>
               <p>The folders that begin the collected materials for each October Term are the appellate docket books. These are a case-by-case listing, in the order of their assigned docket number, of each appellate matter that comes before the Court in that term. In these docket books, each case is given a page on which is printed the docket number, the full name of the case, and the name of the lower court in which the case originated and from which it is now being appealed. Also included on these pages is a grid listing the names of all the justices. The grid has columns in which to record each justice's vote on the relevant questions before the Court, including the most crucial issue of whether to allow the matter to be argued before the Court, that is, whether to grant the writ of certiorari. There is also space reserved in the grid for matters relating to jurisdiction, the "merits" of the case, and other relevant issues. The remainder of the page allows room for the justice to take notes, both as to their own views, as well as those of their fellow justices.</p>
               <p>The next set of materials in each October Term are the appellate docket memoranda. These were memoranda prepared by Justice Fortas's law clerks regarding cases that were before the Court for review. These memoranda were prepared to assist the justice with the evaluation of the very large number of appellate cases offered for the Court's review each term. It was the clerk's task to provide a concise introduction to the facts of the case, together with other relevant matters, and then to make a recommendation as to whether the justice should deny or accept the matter for review. There are also memoranda prepared by the law clerks on larger issues of law specifically requested by the justice. Frequently multiple memoranda were written on a case or an issue and these are kept together. Each memorandum concludes with the initials of the clerk who authored the document. At the top of these memoranda, Justice Fortas indicated his decision in pencil. These memoranda were generally not circulated to other justices, and were for the internal use of the justice and his personal staff.</p>
               <p>In many cases, Justice Fortas accepted the recommendation of his clerks as indicated in these appellate docket memoranda. However, in a significant number of instances, Justice Fortas asked his clerks to clarify the argument or facts of the case as they were presented by the clerk, or to do additional research, before he would follow their recommendations. There are many times when Fortas set aside a clerk's recommendation and struck off on his own. Also noteworthy are the occasions when Justice Fortas changed his view on a case multiple times. These memoranda also demonstrate Fortas's attention to detail. Ever the former editor-in-chief of his law journal, Fortas often corrected his clerks' typographical and citational errors, despite the fact that these memoranda usually were not circulated or published.</p>
               <p>The next set of materials are the miscellaneous docket books. At the time of Justice Fortas's tenure on the Court, the docket was divided into the appellate docket and the miscellaneous docket. These dockets were in part distinguished from each other by the fact that the miscellaneous docket included in forma pauperis cases ("in the form of a poor person," that is, not liable for the costs of the court). The miscellaneous docket also contained cases such as disputes between states, in which, under Article III of the Constitution, the Supreme Court had "original jurisdiction," instead of serving as an appellate court as is the case generally. The miscellaneous docket books are otherwise the same as the appellate docket books.</p>
               <p>The miscellaneous docket memoranda differ from the appellate docket memoranda in that the miscellaneous memoranda were prepared by the chief justice's law clerks. The chief justice's contingent of law clerks was larger than that of the other justices, and they had this additional task assigned to them. All justices received carbon copies of these memoranda which were commonly called "flimsies." Justice Fortas's clerks often offered their own evaluations of the chief justice's clerks' memoranda. This sometimes led Fortas's clerks to write their own supplementary memos on miscellaneous docket matters which are attached to the flimsies. The very large number of miscellaneous docket memoranda, which include many petitions from prisoners who sometimes wrote their pleas in unorthodox ways, tend to have fewer annotations by Justice Fortas and his clerks, aside from the necessary decision to accept or deny the writ or appeal.</p>
               <p>In the materials from October Terms 1965, 1966, and 1968, the miscellaneous docket memoranda are followed by the so-called "Nine Copy" memoranda. These memoranda were written by Justice Fortas's clerks when the chief justice's office did not circulate a flimsy in a case listed on the miscellaneous docket.</p>
               <p>The next set of materials in each October Term are the internal housekeeping or administrative files. These materials include the conference lists, often annotated by Justice Fortas.</p>
               <p>The case files follow, again presented in order of their assigned docket number. As noted above, the docket number of a case was assigned when it was first presented to the Court, and that docket number remained attached to the case for as long as it continued. References to a case in the standard legal research sources, in addition to providing a citation to the volume number and page number in United States Reports and other published versions, also provide the original docket number that guided the case through the Supreme Court.</p>
               <p>The case files reveal the complex development of a final decision by the Supreme Court. Sometimes they include numerous drafts that show radical changes in the decision over several months as justices changed their positions. The files often include lengthy memoranda regarding justices' positions on issues. The internal correspondence evidences changes in position as justices agreed to join opinions if specific modifications were made. Sometimes lengthy concurrences or dissents were written and revised only to be later withdrawn as the justice joined another opinion. Occasionally the files contain numerous drafts of opinions for a case in which the Court ultimately dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted. More often, a lengthy opinion, for which no majority or plurality could be constructed, became a brief, unsigned "per curiam" opinion that left out many of the contentious particulars. These files document the identity of the author of many of these unsigned opinions, some in landmark cases. They also reflect the Court's internal deliberations with regard to major issues of the day such as race, obscenity, juvenile justice, the draft and the growing conflict in Vietnam, and school desegregation.</p>
               <p>The case files provide a record of each case that the Court accepted for hearing or review. There is no typical file in this series. The materials relating to some cases are contained within a single folder. While such files are generally for cases in which Justice Fortas did not write an opinion, there are still valuable materials in them. They often contain handwritten notes that Justice Fortas took during the conference of all the justices. They also contain carbon copies of memoranda between the justices as to whose opinion a justice chose to join. Justices often changed their minds as opinions went through multiple drafts and circulations, as majority, dissenting, and concurring opinions were proposed, then abandoned, then reformulated. There are often additional memoranda written by Justice Fortas's clerks, as well as various marginal, handwritten notes to and from Fortas and his clerks. Each file concludes with the various printed drafts of all the final opinions involved, including concurring and dissenting opinions. These printed versions were circulated among all the justices and their comments often appear in the margins. The last item in each of the case files is the final, official printed version of the Court's opinion.</p>
               <p>Some cases, especially those in which Justice Fortas wrote one of the opinions, take up multiple files. In addition to the materials noted above, these files usually contain numerous handwritten drafts of the opinions, both in Fortas's hand, and in the hand of his clerks, as well as extensive internal correspondence between Justice Fortas and his clerks. There is also considerable and often quite candid correspondence among the justices, and the more formal memoranda to the conference, the latter of which were circulated among all the justices. There are letters and newspaper clippings sent to Justice Fortas prior to his writing his opinion, as well as after his opinion was published. The letters that Justice Fortas received run the gamut from appreciative fan mail from friends, celebrities, and, most often, simple citizens registering their views, all the way to angry, abusive, "crank" notes regarding his work on the Court. In certain instances, usually when a letter or telegram was particularly odd or even mildly threatening, Fortas specified in his own hand that the correspondence should be saved and set aside, perhaps indicating that some correspondence was not retained. There is often overlap in the included correspondence between his case files and Justice Fortas's active speaking and writing career. People who had seen Fortas speak or read one of his articles or his book on civil rights or civil disobedience, often wrote to the justice regarding a matter with which the Supreme Court was grappling. Justice Fortas's clerks and his office staff also seem to have collected some materials, such as articles, notes, and newspapers clippings, to add to the files and perhaps to aid Justice Fortas's deliberations on a given case.</p>
               <p>In some instances, when cases dealt with similar matters, a decision was made by the justices to link a number of cases together, creating omnibus companion cases. Case files that relate to more than one case are identified by the name and docket number of the first case in the final form of the printed opinion. The docket numbers of the other companion cases appear in brackets in the folder title. In the hectic life of a case before the Court, companion cases are often added and, on a number of occasions, later dropped, and perhaps later added again, as the judicial process continues.</p>
               <p>The next large group of materials in the series are the extensive correspondence and related memoranda and printed materials, such as newspaper and journal articles, that specifically relate to the major events in Justice Fortas's judicial career. The first set of files relate to Fortas's nomination by President Johnson as associate justice of the Supreme Court in 1965. The next set relates to Fortas's nomination as chief justice of the United States in 1968. Correspondence, memoranda, and other materials related to Fortas's withdrawal of his nomination as chief justice in the face of a flurry of controversy and opposition follow. The group concludes with the correspondence and other materials related to Justice Fortas's resignation from the Supreme Court in 1969. Included in these files is the official correspondence between Fortas and President Johnson, President Richard M. Nixon, Chief Justice Earl Warren and other members of the Court, various members of the U.S. Congress, and other government officials, both in support of and in opposition to, Fortas's two nominations. As word spread that Fortas was considering resigning, a large number of people wrote to him, mostly to encourage him not to resign from the Supreme Court. Of particular note here is Fortas's explanation, in a letter to Chief Justice Warren, of the controversies that led to his resignation, as well as handwritten notes of Fortas's conversation with President Nixon on the day of his resignation. There are additional materials that speak to Fortas's resignation from the Court in correspondence and materials in other series, especially the writings series and the correspondence and topical files series.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The correspondence and topical files series is arranged alphabetically. Folders in this series are most often titled with the name of a person. However, the materials in these folders are not limited to correspondence to or from that person, but include materials about the person as well. In its original order, complicated by multiple, conflicting filing systems, and its own cross-reference notations, Fortas seems to have filed correspondence according to what he considered its subject, and usually not by the identity of the correspondent. Additionally, Fortas sometimes indicated that he wanted a new file started with a new name that he wrote at the top of a document, or that he circled on the document. To the greatest extent possible, these indications have been followed and this original order has been maintained. It should also be noted that there is significant correspondence in every other series of the Fortas Papers, including extensive correspondence relating to Fortas's tenure on and resignation from the Supreme Court in Series I.</p>
               <p>The most comprehensive files in this series document Fortas's more than fifty year relationship with William O. Douglas. This formative association lasted from Fortas's days as a student of Douglas's at the Yale Law School, to Fortas's service at the Securities and Exchange Commission where Douglas served as Chairman, to their eventual joint service on the Supreme Court of the United States, and beyond. Also noteworthy are the files that are devoted to members of Fortas's extended family, such as his cousin, Meyer Fortes, the South African born social anthropologist, as well as the Aggers, the Blooms, the Kerbels, and the Slomes. There are also extensive materials in this series on Lyndon B. Johnson (supplementing the White House series), as well as many files that relate to Fortas's musical life, including intimate friendships and collaborations with Pablo Casals, Alexander Schneider, and Isaac Stern.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The writings series is divided into three sub-sections: books, articles, and speeches. The folders related to Fortas's books are arranged alphabetically. The folders related to his articles and speeches are arranged chronologically. Published articles are differentiated from unpublished articles by the use of quotation marks and the inclusion of the name of the periodical in which the article was published. If known, the title of the article or speech is given in the folder description. The range and depth of the materials that constitute this series vary widely. Some folders contain an extensive record of the speech or writing, including the initial invitation to speak or produce an article, background materials, and multiple drafts. Many files also contain extensive correspondence with representatives of the host organization or editors; newspaper clippings and reviews that resulted from the speech or writing; and, in some cases, considerable and substantive correspondence from a wide array of people. Beyond letters from his readers or members of his audience, it was also Fortas's habit to send copies of his speeches and writings to friends, acquaintances, business associates, government officials, academics, and public figures. Many files contain carbon copies of the brief notes accompanying the speech or article. Other files in this series are less complete. In cases where the text of the speech or writing itself is missing, a note of "Background materials only" has been added to the folder title.</p>
               <p>The earliest writings in the series date from Fortas's final months as undersecretary of the Interior. During this time he often spoke for Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, his boss and early mentor. Fortas also often spoke for President Roosevelt and for the Democratic Party, appearing at campaign rallies and on radio programs to support Democratic policies and politicians. He also expressed his own views, particularly against the coming excesses of the Cold War, and for a strong and meaningful international force, such as he helped to develop in the United Nations, in an attempt to avoid a relapse into world war.</p>
               <p>As founding partner of a powerful and respected law firm, Fortas spoke as often on matters of human rights as on the business and finance questions facing his expanding base of corporate clients. One of his abiding interests, which is strongly reflected in this series, was that of the interaction of law and psychiatry. The files document Fortas's work related to his appointment in 1954 as counsel to Monte Durham in the case of Durham v. United States. This case helped transform the law of criminal responsibility as it relates to mental illness. Fortas was a vocal opponent of the "red baiting" and "red hunting" tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy and his allies, and this is clearly reflected in his firm's representation of many of those accused by McCarthy and others. Fortas was also a highly sought after toastmaster, and his ready wit is documented and greatly praised in these files.</p>
               <p>In the years just prior to his nomination to the Supreme Court, Fortas's stature and popularity increased greatly, both because of his status as a personal friend, and legal and political advisor to President Lyndon B. Johnson, and as one of the nation's most respected corporate lawyers. This increasing prominence was evident in the large number of public appearances Fortas was asked to make, and the articles that he was asked to contribute to a variety of publications, both scholarly and popular. During this period, Fortas also addressed America's growing racial difficulties, both in the northern cities and across his native south.</p>
               <p>Once on the Court, Fortas continued to have an active public personae, becoming one of the most visible members of Chief Justice Earl Warren's dynamic court. While on the Supreme Court, Fortas was given a number of honorary degrees, and invited to give prestigious lectures (some of which later were published as articles), often giving his views on the nature and meaning of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court's unique role in interpreting that document. He was also a leading analyst during this period of the civil and campus unrest that was sweeping the nation. His book, Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedience was widely reviewed, and it led to a great deal of correspondence, both from the general public and from those known personally to Fortas. He was prized as a critic of extremists on both sides of the national and international campus battles, and spoke at dozens of educational institutions across the country.</p>
               <p>After the withdrawal of his name for the position of chief justice and his subsequent resignation from the Supreme Court, Fortas's production and presence were little diminished. He continued to write and speak extensively on civil disobedience and civil rights. He returned to his abiding interest in the issue of antitrust law, developed through his legal practice, and through his long and formative relationship with William O. Douglas. He also addressed matters related to the Watergate scandal and the question of presidential impeachment, Puerto Rican politics and business, and the death penalty.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The White House Papers series is arranged alphabetically by name and subject, with names and subjects interspersed, as was the case in Fortas's original filing system. Fortas's White House related papers appear to have been filed under over-lapping and cross-cutting systems. We can speculate that, due to the variety of roles that Fortas was playing, he had many assistants and filing systems. Most materials in these folders are notated with several filing numbers and letters indicating, again, several organizational systems. Fortas seems to have had extensive files located at his office at Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter, and at his home. He also seems to have kept some files at the White House. As indications of this additional if unofficial status, many letters sent to Fortas were simply addressed to his name and "White House," and Fortas's Who's Who entry from this era went so far as to list his professional address not as his law firm or his home office, but as the White House itself.</p>
               <p>The bulk of the materials in the series document Fortas's relationship with Senator, Vice-President, and President, Lyndon Baines Johnson. When Johnson was elected Vice-President in 1960 and suddenly became President in 1963, Fortas continued as one of Johnson's closest advisors on a wide variety of matters, as well as a personal and family friend. The primary reason that Fortas found himself as an unofficial but ubiquitous and vital advisor in the White House, was his personal relationship with Johnson. This relationship is documented in numerous letters, notes, suggestions, memoranda, and related materials sent between Fortas and Johnson, as well as materials relating to Lady Bird Johnson and the Johnsons' daughters. Both Fortas and his wife, Carolyn E. Agger (who was a noted tax attorney with the firm of Paul, Weiss, Wharton, Rifkind &amp; Garrison, and later became Fortas's law partner at Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter), provided financial and legal guidance to the Johnsons. In the original order of the materials, portions of these materials relating specifically to Johnson were roughly divided between personal and political correspondence and materials, and that order has been maintained to the greatest degree possible. It should be noted, however, that there is a great deal of overlap between the materials in these folders.</p>
               <p>Other materials contained in the files directly related to President Johnson include drafts of and suggestions for speeches that Fortas was asked to work on for Johnson. Included in these folders are also comments that Fortas was asked by President Johnson's advisors to make on speeches often initially drafted by others. The most extensive of these folders document such events as the 1964 State of the Union Address, which the American people looked to as LBJ's first major statement of policy immediately following President John F. Kennedy's assassination; the "War on Poverty" speech that was integral to Johnson's Great Society initiative; the 1964 presidential campaign; and Johnson's December 1963 address to the United Nations, which introduced the world to President Johnson's views on international affairs. Fortas, as Chairperson of the 1965 Inaugural Concert Committee and as a central planner for the inaugural festivities as a whole, also found himself and his office as a locus for the frenetic activity that went into planning that politically and symbolically important event. The many aspects of the inaugural, including correspondence from many leading artists, business leaders, and educators, are extensively documented in these files. The early histories of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the National Council on the Arts, as well as the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities, and Fortas's role in their organization, are also documented in this series. These folders demonstrate the central advisory role that Fortas continued to play for President Johnson after Fortas had taken his seat on the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
               <p>Among the other subjects substantively documented in the series are those that relate to Puerto Rico and Fortas's long-standing involvement, dating back to his days working for various governmental organizations in the New Deal, with the law and politics of that island. There are extensive materials on the political and military crisis in the Dominican Republic in 1965, in which Fortas played a leading role; the Vietnam war and its deep impact on the Johnson administration; crime and violence in the United States in the wake of increasing civil and racial unrest; the 1964 presidential election; and the Warren Commission.</p>
               <p>Other files relate to individual people, including John W. Macy, Jr., who was Chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission. Many of the appointments that were within President Johnson's power to make or influence fell under Macy's purview. Within the Macy folder are many letters written to Fortas by those seeking a position in the Executive Branch. Fortas then often passed on the name of the candidate to Macy, usually with some form of Fortas's personal evaluation of the candidate.</p>
               <p>In addition to personal correspondence that Fortas received in relation to his role in the Johnson White House, he also received a large amount of "public correspondence" from the general public. This correspondence is filed alphabetically and then chronologically by correspondent. In the periods following President Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 and Johnson's presidential election in November 1964, Fortas was widely identified in many media reports as a member of President Johnson's "inner circle" of advisors and friends. As a result, Fortas was inundated with correspondence from the public at large and sometimes forgotten acquaintances, often seeking to use Fortas's access to President Johnson as a means by which to get their ideas or themselves presented to the President.</p>

               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by the governmental organization with which Fortas was affiliated, and then by subject within each governmental unit. The materials in this series best document Fortas's years at the Department of the Interior. Fortas spent the last years of his government service, beginning in June 1939, at the Department of the Interior working closely with Secretary Harold L. Ickes. Fortas would eventually rise to the position of Under Secretary in 1942, serving as Ickes's chief deputy. He often served as Acting Secretary in Ickes's absence from Washington. In this capacity, Fortas attended a number of war-time cabinet meetings, at which he took thorough notes for Secretary Ickes. As Under Secretary, Fortas also served as Secretary of the quasi-governmental Petroleum Reserves Corporation and on the Board of Directors of the Virgin Islands Company. In addition, the series documents Fortas's service as a member of the Committee on Legal Personnel Board of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the President's Advisory Committee to Study Changes in the Organic Law of Puerto Rico, and the National Power Policy Committee. A wide variety of other subjects are covered in these files, including the conditions under martial law for Americans of Japanese descent in Hawaii, and a host of matters relating to natural resources and conservation, both within the United States and abroad. There is extensive correspondence from colleagues, friends, and acquaintances in the series, such as William O. Douglas, Alger Hiss, Harold L. Ickes, Archibald MacLeish, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., and Harry S. Truman.</p>
               <p>Fortas left government service in 1946, immediately after he had served as a member of the United States delegation to the formative United Nations conferences in Dumbarton Oaks, Muir Woods, San Francisco, and London. Fortas often kept daily logs of his activities, and provided extensive reports and analyses to Ickes of all the happenings at these conferences.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by name of organization or institution. This series documents the range of activities that Fortas undertook helping to shape and lead a wide range of organizations, from the technical details of criminal procedure, to legal services and civil liberties, to the rich worlds of music, art, and theater in which Fortas lived for much of his life.</p>
               <p>The institutional life of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is best documented in this series. Nearly every Kennedy Center file contains correspondence from or to the long-time Kennedy Center director, Roger L. Stevens, as well as other members of the trustees, administrators, and staff of the Kennedy Center. The series includes frequent correspondence from Harold Burson, a founder of a leading public relations and public affairs firm and Fortas's cousin who was brought onto various Kennedy Center boards on Fortas's suggestion. Trustees such as J. Carter Brown, S. Dillon Ripley, J. Edward M. Kennedy, Harry C. McPherson, Jr., and Jack Valenti, also appear frequently. The files additionally document Fortas's role in organizing and directing Kennedy Center Productions, Inc. (KCPI), which served as the Kennedy Center's production company and as an important source of revenue beginning in 1972. Many plays and musical performances were developed and produced by KCPI, including such works as Annie and First Monday in October. These files contain detailed, often handwritten, notes by Fortas documenting the complete negotiation and production process for shows that found their way to the Kennedy Center stage and sometimes to stages and movie screens around the world. According to the National Archives and Records Administration, the materials contained in this series may well be the most complete documentation of the Kennedy Center available, as the Kennedy Center itself has no functioning archives. Fortas's roles on other boards dealing with music and theater, such as Carnegie Hall and the National Symphony Orchestra, are also extensively documented. There is correspondence in these files from many of the world's great musicians and performers.</p>
               <p>As a leading legal advocate and as a friend and advisor to President Johnson, Fortas found himself serving on many committees charged with the task of developing and amending laws and procedures through a wide array of judicial, administrative, governmental, and private boards and committees. Fortas's abiding interest in civil liberties, equal treatment and opportunity under the law, the legal treatment of the indigent and the insane, and the use and abuse of narcotic drugs in society, are all well documented in this series. Fortas's leading role on two presidential committees on equal employment opportunity, and his long involvement with the Washington School of Psychiatry (an affiliate of the William Alanson White Psychiatric Foundation and the A. K. Rice Institute) are also well documented.</p>
