               <p>---Each item description begins with the title of each register:</p>
               <p>The title comes from (in order of preference): the title page, the cover, the page headings, the first words in the register, a name or description used by the vendor, or a descriptive title assigned by the staff of the Judaica Collection. If the title does not appear in the book itself, it is in brackets. In cases where there are one or more alternate titles, they are separated by semi-colons.</p>
               <p>Titles that are originally in non-Roman alphabets appear in Romanized transliterations. Use of diacritics is inconsistent.</p>
               <p>---The title is followed by the place where the register was written:</p>
               <p>Usually the place is written as it appears in the book, or in its Romanized form. Common forms are used for well-known names (for example: New York, not Nyu-York).</p>
               <p>If available, the name of the place in the form authorized according to cataloging rules is added in parentheses, especially if it differs from the way the name of the place appears in the book.</p>
               <p>---The date of the work appears at the end of each description:</p>
               <p>Hebrew dates are in numeric form according to how they appear in the register, i.e. 760 or 5760. Gregorian dates are provided in brackets for each Hebrew date. The Hebrew year 650 appears as 650, [1889-1890], since either of those two years would be possible. If the month is known, only the correct Gregorian year is provided.</p>
               <p>At times one year is written on the title page, but the register includes dated entries covering a span of years. In that case the Hebrew date would be written as it appears in the book, but the Gregorian dates would reflect the actual years covered in the register.</p>
               <p>---Physical description is included when available. The number of pages in brackets indicates that the pages are not numbered in the book.</p>
               <p>---The descriptions are based on material provided by the vendor, examination of the book, and translations by staff members.</p>

In the register are five pages of the society's by-laws and approx. twelve pages of the names decorated in color (some with calligraphy) of people with notes about each community member who belonged to the group, when he became a member, how much he paid, etc. Presumably this community is the one in Hungary, although there is one with a similar name in Germany."

               <p>---Each item description begins with the title of each register:</p>
               <p>The title comes from (in order of preference): the title page, the cover, the page headings, the first words in the register, a name or description used by the vendor, or a descriptive title assigned by the staff of the Judaica Collection. If the title does not appear in the book itself, it is in brackets. In cases where there are one or more alternate titles, they are separated by semi-colons.</p>
               <p>Titles that are originally in non-Roman alphabets appear in Romanized transliterations. Use of diacritics is inconsistent.</p>
               <p>---The title is followed by the place where the register was written:</p>
               <p>Usually the place is written as it appears in the book, or in its Romanized form. Common forms are used for well-known names (for example: New York, not Nyu-York).</p>
               <p>If available, the name of the place in the form authorized according to cataloging rules is added in parentheses, especially if it differs from the way the name of the place appears in the book.</p>
               <p>---The date of the work appears at the end of each description:</p>
               <p>Hebrew dates are in numeric form according to how they appear in the register, i.e. 760 or 5760. Gregorian dates are provided in brackets for each Hebrew date. The Hebrew year 650 appears as 650, [1889-1890], since either of those two years would be possible. If the month is known, only the correct Gregorian year is provided.</p>
               <p>At times one year is written on the title page, but the register includes dated entries covering a span of years. In that case the Hebrew date would be written as it appears in the book, but the Gregorian dates would reflect the actual years covered in the register.</p>
               <p>---Physical description is included when available. The number of pages in brackets indicates that the pages are not numbered in the book.</p>
               <p>---The descriptions are based on material provided by the vendor, examination of the book, and translations by staff members.</p>

                     <p>Manuscript register from the Jewish community council of Zgierz, Poland containing protocols covering the fifteen-year period from 1915 to 1930. Zgierz, a city in the Lodz province of central Poland, had a Jewish population of approximately 4,000 during these years. The order of the protocols is not continuous: at the front of the volume are protocols no. 406-413 (1930), followed by no. 1-13 (1915-1917), one unnumbered protocol from 1918, and then the rest of the protocols, no.1-405. A detailed description by Y. A Malchieli of this manuscript has been published in the Book of Zgierz (Hebrew, 1975; English translation, 2007) and on the JewishGen website. Malchieli writes that the Communal Council dealt with "matters of ritual slaughter (shechita), schools, prayers, bathhouses, cemeteries, the various assistance and support organizations serving the needy, religious affairs and other matters. As well, it served as the official representative body of the Jewish community to the various governments and other causes. The Communal Council oversaw a staff of workers and a variety of institutions and funds. To support its activities, it imposed taxes upon the community..." The protocols in this volume record discussions about all of these matters as well as important events affecting the community including pogroms, anti-semitism, Zionism and Jewish settlements in the land of Israel. In Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish and German. [276] pages; 37 centimeters.</p>

                     <p>Register from a synagogue and house of study in Bucharest, Romania. The introduction describes the turbulent history of the community: the holy society ("havurah kedoshah") was established in 1794, but when hard times forced Jews to flee the city the first register book was lost. The second pinkas, written in 1800, was also destroyed when a fire burned thousands of houses along with the old synagogue. Years later a member of the society recovered the original pinkas, and this volume, which is dated 607 [1846 or 1847], contains a copy of the thirteen original by-laws. There are several philosophical texts--treatises on cosmogony and theology, as well as lists of members of the society. Some of the entries are dated as late as 633 [1872 or 1873]. The entire text, except for one page in script in the back of the volume, is written in neat, legible calligraphy, the introduction in Rashi script and the rest in block letters. In Hebrew. Approximately 75 leaves (mostly blank; approximately 20 pages with text); 40 centimeters. Original leather cover with title and ornamentation stamped in gold ink.</p>

                     <p>Register of the Hevrah Kadisha (burial society) of the Jewish community of Craiova, Romania. The register contains by-laws and decisions signed by leaders and members of the society, as well as accounts of various events in the community, such as a dispute between a group of more modern Jewish people who wanted to transport the deceased to the cemetery in a new wagon, while members of the Hevrah Kadisha insisted on carrying the body according to the old custom on a stretcher by foot. The volume has two illuminated title pages. The first, dated 607 [that is, 1846 or 1847] is in colored ink and paint . At the top of the page a lion is depicted crouched within the arched frieze of a portal. On either side are two columns, supported beneath by a panel with marble-like decoration. The title is written in calligraphy in the middle of the page surrounded by fine geometric patterns which have been drawn or printed and applied to the page. The second title page is illuminated in black ink, with intricate lettering in different styles inside geometric and floral borders. This page is dated 5608 [1847 or 1848]. It is signed by Solomon Löbel. A page with a colorful painted border chronicles events in the community's history including the pogroms and expulsion of many of the Jews in 1885, signed by David Yosef ben Mosheh Yehuda Psalter Shats, the cantor of the synagogue, dated Kislev and Tishre 5668 [1907]. The register is written in Yiddish and in Hebrew. 44 pages; 42 centimeters.</p>

                     <p>Register of a Jewish community now known as Považská Bystrica, Slovakia and formerly as Vag Besztercze (Hungarian) and Waag Bistritz (German). The title page is lacking. The first page (p.2) contains a poem in Hebrew praising the faithful founders of the community. It is signed in an acrostic by the scribe Kalman Kohn. Pages 3-9 contain several introductory statements in German, Hebrew and Yiddish signed by officials and leaders of the community. Following these is an index to over one hundred by-laws of the congregation, which are written in Yiddish script on pages 10b-19. The by-laws cover such topics as obligations of community members, prayers and synagogue protocols, and disbursement of funds for communal and charitable needs. After the by-laws are several more official declarations in various languages including four pages written in Latin, signed and stamped with red wax seals. The bulk of the volume contains individual pages for each member of the community. The members' names are written in large Hebrew letters. Below each name are notations concerning the member's contributions and the assigned seats in the men's and women's sections of the synagogue. 184 leaves; 43 centimeters.

                  <p>Manuscript register book from the Jewish community of Oldenzaal, the Netherlands. Ink on paper, with original vellum binding. The title page is decorated with drawings of two cherubs standing atop columns supporting the word "Pinkas" [register book], with a crown on the top. The book, dated 561 [1800 or 1801], was made to raise funds to build a synagogue. According to the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, "a division in the community [of Oldenzaal] in 1800 led to a decision to found a second synagogue. The new house of worship was consecrated in 1802." The first section of the book contains pages with members' names at the top and foldable cut-out tabs to record their pledges on the Sabbath or holidays without writing. Another section of the book records well over a century--from the beginning of the nineteenth century until autumn 1941--of the members of the community selected to receive honors on holidays.</p>
