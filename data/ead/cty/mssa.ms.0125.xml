         <abstract id="aspace_7f1254f97e12790f0644b26a6853976a">The papers consist of correspondence, writings, photographs and family papers, and document Walter Camp's devotion to sports and in particular to football, which form he greatly modified. In his voluminous correspondence with Yale football stars, players at other universities, football coaches and sports associations, the interpretation of football rules forms one of the principal topics of correspondence. Prominent figures include George A. Adee, Thomas L. McClung, Vance D. McCormick, S. Brinckerhoff Thorne, Ray Tompkins, Alonzo Stagg and Fielding H. Yost. Camp's interest in physical fitness was put into action during World War I when he organized exercise programs for elderly men, a special program for Washington officials, and ultimately developed his "Daily Dozen" exercises for the Navy. These activities are reflected in his correspondence with Newton D. Baker, Josephus Daniels, John W. Davis, William G. McAdoo, Franklin D. Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. He also corresponded with Theodore Roosevelt, 1905 and 1908, in connection with a commission set up to investigate fatalities in football during the season of 1905. Approximately twelve feet of the papers are made up of Camp's writings, which include articles, rule manuals, reviews and books. Half the material is devoted to football and another large section is on physical fitness.</abstract>

         <p>Five series comprise the Walter Camp Papers: Series I, Correspondence, Series II, Writings, Series III, Newspaper and Magazine Clippings, Series IV, Photographs, and Series V, Family Papers. The material covers the approximate period 1875 - 1925, an historic period of fifty years in the development of sports, particularly football. The papers have been microfilmed and the microfilm arrangement is described in Appendix A.</p>
         <p>Replying to a question, "What is your hobby today", in a questionnaire from The Select Features Company (presumably around 1890), Walter Camp answered, "Athletics and physical fitness," and it is interesting that his correspondence, in Series I - indeed most of the other series as well - deal principally with these two general subjects.</p>
         <p>Camp corresponded with many Yale football stars on matters concerning football, including George A. Adee, Burr Chamberlin, William H. Corbin, Robert N. Corwin, Charles O. Gill, Frank A. Hinkey, T. A. D. Jones, Malcolm L. McBride, Thomas L. McClung, Vance D. McCormick, Fred T. Murphy, Thomas L. Shevlin, Jr., S. Brinckerhoff Thorne and Ray Tompkins. Others, on the interpretation of football rules, were William S. Langford, H. E. Van Surdam, Henry M. Wheaton, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, H. S. White and Fielding H. Yost. He kept in close touch with prominent members of the football rules committee, James A. Babbitt, John C. Bell, Paul J. Dashiell, Parke H. Davis, L. M. Dennis, J. B. Fine, E. K. Hall, Percy Haughton, ALexander Moffat, W. M. Morice, W. T. Reid, Alonzo A. Stagg, H. L. Williams and Robert D. Wrenn. And noteworthy is his correspondence with President Theodore Roosevelt during the critical years when the game of football faced the prospect of being outlawed because of brutality.</p>
         <p>Camp's interest in coaching football led to much correspondence with famous coaches throughout the country, Burr Chamberlin (Stanford University), Percy D. Haughton (Harvard University), John W. Heisman (Georgia Institute of Technology), T.A.D. Jones (Yale University), William W. Roper (Princeton University), Alonzo A. Stagg (University of Chicago), Glenn S. Warner (United States Indian School and the University of Pittsburgh) and Fielding H. Yost (University of Michigan).</p>
         <p>On the sometimes strained Yale-Harvard athletic relations, Harvard alumni correspondents included: Professor James Barr Ames, dean of the Harvard Law School; Lebaron R. Briggs, dean of Harvard College and president of Radcliffe College; Lorin Deland, a Boston attorney who collaborated with Camp on the book, <title render="italic">
               Football
            </title>; W. Cameron Forbes, a prominent businessman in Boston, author of articles on athletics for <title render="italic">
               Collier's Weekly
            </title> and <title render="italic">
               Outing
            </title> and later ambassador to Japan; James J. Storrow, Boston attorney and banker; and Mark Sullivan, an editor of <title render="italic">
               Collier's Weekly
            </title> and noted author and commentator.</p>
         <p>Among the Yale alumni with whom Camp corresponded on general athletics were Eugene Lamb Richards, professor of mathematics, director of the Yale gymnasium and author of articles on Yale athletics, and Samuel J. Elder, prominent Boston lawyer and president of the Boston Bar Association, whose letters brought news of athletics at Harvard.</p>
         <p>The subject of physical fitness, in which Camp had a life-long interest, led to correspondence with prominent political figures in Washington, including Newton D. Baker, Josephus Daniels, John W. Davis, Franklyn K. Lane, William G. McAdoo, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Daniel C. Roper and John Q. Tilson, in connection with the founding of the Senior Service Corps. Through these political contacts he corresponded with many government departments on this subject, including the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Navy, the Interior, Treasury and War, and the Tariff Commission, Locally, in New Haven, where the Senior Service Corps was founded, Camp kept in contact with two men who provided leadership for the corps, Professor William Howard Taft (ex-president) and Col. Isaac M. Ullman, president of the New Haven Chamber of Commerce.</p>
         <p>Involved continuously in Yale matters, Camp corresponded with important figures including Arthur T. Hadley, Henry B. Sargent, Charles Seymour, Charles H. Sherrill, Anson Phelps Stokes, Theodore S. Woolsey, Henry P. Wright and William Burnet Wright, Jr. He consulted with Samuel J. Fiske and George S. Mason on legal matters affecting Yale. There is also considerable correspondence on the subject of Yale athletic programs with the Yale Field Corporation, Yale Financial Union, the Yale University Athletic, Baseball, and Football Associations, the Yale University Boat Club, the Secretary's office and the Treasurer's office.</p>
         <p>Camp was in contact with his book publishers: A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros., American Sports Publishing Company, Byron G. Moon &amp; Company, Charles Scribner's Sons, D. Appleton &amp; Company, D. C. Heath &amp; Company, Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, Harper &amp; Bros., Herbert W. Fisher, Moffat, Yard &amp; Company and the Platt &amp; Peck Company. There is also much correspondence with magazines carrying Camp's articles: <emph render="italic">Baseball Magazine, Boy's Magazine, Century, Collier's Weekly, Golf Illustrated, Outing, St. Nicholas, Saturday Evening Post, Vanity Fair, Women's Home Companion, World's Work, the Yale Alumni Weekly</emph> and <emph render="italic">Youth's Companion</emph>. Correspondence with well-known newspapers included the <emph render="italic">Boston Globe, New York Herald, Philadelphia Press, the Week's Sport</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Yale Daily News.</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Prominent among the authors with whom Camp corresponded were: Silas Bent, editor and promoter of a syndicated house-organ series of industrial pamphlets on good health habits; Alfred S. Eyre, author of articles for <emph render="italic">Collier's Weekly</emph>; Norman Hapgood, a <emph render="italic">Collier's Weekly</emph> editor; William Heyliger, who syndicated Camp's articles on special sporting subjects and collaborated on the book <emph render="italic">Danny the Freshman</emph>; Harford Powel, Jr., an editor of <emph render="italic">Collier's Weekly</emph> and Camp's authorized biographer; H. G. Salsinger, sporting editor of the <emph render="italic">Detroit News</emph> and one of Camp's contacts with football players in the Middle West; and Caspar Whitney with whom Camp had a long association, first on <emph render="italic">The Week's Sport</emph> in the 1880's and then at <emph render="italic">Outing</emph> and <emph render="italic">Collier's Weekly</emph>, and Harper &amp; Brothers.</p>
         <p>Walter Camp's correspondence in Series I includes a considerable amount of material, minutes, committee reports, agreements, contracts, etc., which bears on the subject of the correspondence. Consult Appendix B for details.</p>
         <p>Another question in the questionnaire referred to above was, "What was your ambition when you were a boy?" Camp replied, "To write." It would appear that this ambition was realized during his lifetime, for Series II, WRITINGS, constitutes a major section in the Walter Camp Papers. Most of the articles are typescripts and undated except for the Consolidated Press pieces. The Consolidated Press articles, exclusive press releases on football and general athletics, were syndicated, usually twice a week, by the Consolidated Press Association of Washington, D. C., to many newspapers throughout the country during the 1920's.</p>
         <p>Approximately one-half of the writings are concerned with football, its history, reviews of the seasons, All-America teams and rules. Although not complete, the series includes most of the football rules and guide books, dating back to 1876, most written by Camp. Included also is the investigating committee questionnaire and report in 1893-1894. The study was designed to weigh the benefits, both mentally and physically, of the game of football against the injuries sustained. The questionnaire was mailed by Camp to approximately 1,200 football players and coaches in the United States, and to headmasters of many preparatory and high schools. The report concluded that football was of marked benefit, the injuries trivial, and with improvements called for in the general conduct of the game, football was one of the best sports in America.</p>
         <p>Camp's writings on other sports include rugby, baseball, track, golf, rowing and tennis, and a few articles on women in sports and athletics in general. The remainder of this series consists of writings on physical fitness, the Daily Dozen, [1] the Senior Service Corps, playgrounds and recreation, general articles on the game of bridge, clocks, Yale College and the Yale Bowl, and Camp's poems and aphorisms.</p>
         <p>Series III contains the newspaper and magazine clippings which Walter Camp collected from the local press and from subscription clipping services across the country. Difficulties in processing these clippings -- some over one hundred years old -- were experienced due to the deterioration of the newsprint, but an estimated 90 per cent have been preserved on microfilm. The material supplements, and in some cases duplicates in printed form, Camp's writings as described in Series II. Unfortunately, many of the clippings are undated.</p>
         <p>This series is important not only for articles written by Camp which otherwise might have been lost, but for editorial comment and photographs illustrating the subject. There are also many clippings of articles by Caspar Whitney and other noted journalists and columnists about Camp, or about subjects in which he was interested. No doubt many of the clippings served as research notes for his own articles.</p>
         <p>Interesting material not found elsewhere in the Camp Papers is among the clippings. His false arrest in New York City in 1887, which caused considerable apprehension, is described fully. The memorable Walter Camp dinner in New York in Madison Square Garden in 1892, when he was presented with the beautiful Tiffany sterling silver cup [2] by Yale alumni and others, is reported in detail.</p>
         <p>There are many clippings on the death of Walter Camp in 1925. The most complete collection on this subject, however, is in a bound scrapbook which was presented to Mrs. Camp by her friends, Mary and Charles Goodrich, and will be found in Series V, Family Papers.</p>
         <p>Series IV, Photographs, contains several photographs of Camp as an undergraduate and in later years. Included is the frequently used photograph of him as captain of the football team, standing at the Yale fence, and several photos of Camp with other people, including the football rules committee, and with Guy Nickalls, noted Yale rowing coach.</p>
         <p>Other subjects of photographs include the Daily Dozen and physical fitness groups, notably the "Walter Scamps" in Washington during World War I. Among the Senior Service Corps photos are two of ex-president William Howard Taft and Col. Isaac M. Ullman with Mr. Camp.</p>
         <p>The majority of sports photographs are of football and include games, teams and players of several universities and colleges, and shots taken at football practice. Photographs of other sports include baseball, golf, rowing and track, although the actual number is not large.</p>
         <p>The final series in the Walter Camp Papers contains the family papers, few in number but of interest historically. There is some biographical material and a few pages of a diary kept by Camp as an undergraduate. It also includes his notes on trips to England in 1899 and 1907 mixed with printed travel literature and memorabilia.</p>
         <p>This series also contains scattered correspondence of Mrs. Walter Camp's over the period 1884 - 1934. There are a few letters from the Yale football stars she met as her husband's emissary at football practice, notably Ted Coy, Frank Hinkey, Tad Jones, Lee McClung, Vance McCormick and Ray Tompkins. The files include letters from friends: Julian W. Curtiss, Arthur T. Hadley, E. K. Hall, Mr. and Mrs. Averill Harriman, Guy Nickalls, Caspar Whitney and Mr. and Mrs. Orville Wright and conclude with letters from friends interested in the Walter Camp Memorial.</p>
         <p>Family Papers also includes some correspondence of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Camp, Jr., from 1907 - 1925, and one folder of correspondence of Mrs. John C. English, mother-in-law of Walter Camp, Jr., from 1883 - 1923. Included are three bound scrapbooks. One contains letters of condolence to Mrs. Walter Camp in connection with her husband's death, the second consists of the telegrams she received at that time, and the third, a gift of friends, has a great many clippings of press notices and obituaries.</p>
         <p>In this series, too, under the classification "Memorabilia", is printed material, mostly programs, of athletic contests including baseball, boxing, football, golf, Olympic games, rowing, tennis, track, athletics in general, and Yale College events during Camp's lifetime.</p>
         <p>Many feature stories about Walter Camp have appeared in football programs and Yale alumni publications, national magazines, and in one case the <emph render="italic">American Heritage Magazine of History</emph>. After Camp's death members of the family continued to collect these stories. These are also included in Series V, Family Papers.</p>
         <p>Series V concludes with personal correspondence of Walter Camp's daughter, Janet Troxell, from 1928 - 1980. Among her papers are several folders with her correspondence and research notes in connection with her controversy with Tim Cohane, author of <emph render="italic">The Yale Football Story</emph>.  Mr. Cohane had written that the idea of the "All-America Team" selections originated in 1889 with Caspar Whitney, manager of <emph render="italic">The Week's Sport</emph> newspaper, not with Walter Camp. Naturally Mrs. Troxell resented the inference that her father was dishonest and untruthful in claiming credit for an idea not his own. Mrs. Troxell spent many hours in 1951 and 1952 researching her father's papers at the Yale University Library to dispute the claim of Mr. Cohane, and prove as far as possible that the idea for the "All-America Team" was in fact Walter Camp's. A copy of the book, <emph render="italic">The Yale Football Story</emph>, with her notes on several pages, is included here.</p>
         <p>The papers of Walter Camp came to the Yale University Library in 1926, the gift of his widow, Alice Sumner Camp. They do not include any business correspondence or other material concerning the New Haven Clock Company, nor will researchers find any references to Camp's business career. Starting in 1978, Walter Camp's daughter, Janet Camp Troxell, has augmented her father's papers with a quantity of material important to the background of the Camp family.</p>
         <p>[1] Four sets of the victrola records containing the Daily Dozen exercises were transferred to the Historical Sound Recordings Collection.</p>
         <p>[2] This cup, one of Camp's prize possessions, was recently included in the"Champion of American Sports" exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution, organized by the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, which opened on June 22, 1981.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Walter Camp, 1859 - 1925</p>
         <p>Considered the foremost authority on American athletics, and one who bent his energies successfully for many years toward the formation of clean sports, Walter Camp was probably the best all-around amateur athlete of his time. Famous among college coaches and the orginator of the Daily Dozen series of short-hand exercises for physical fitness, he combined success in athletics with success in business and in letters.</p>
         <p>Walter Camp led a double life. Athletes and college men were proud to point to him as their inspiration and example, and business men hailed him as equally luminous in their sphere as head of the New Haven Clock Company, one of the largest manufacturing concerns in Connecticut at that time. His interests were on the financial and selling side rather than in the factory. Few college men knew that Camp had a business side and the business men, who didn't read the sporting pages, had no idea that he was extensively involved in athletics. Born in New Britain, Connecticut, on April 7, 1859, Walter Camp was the only child of Leverett Lee Camp, a school teacher and publisher, and Ellen Cornwell, daughter of Chauncey Cornwell, both of New Britain. Walter's middle name which he seldom used was Chauncey, His earliest known ancestor was Nicholas Camp, who came to the United States about 1630 from Essex County, England, and settled in Milford, Connecticut.</p>
         <p>Following the death of Mr. Cornwell, Camp's maternal grandfather, in 1863, the Camp family moved to 170 Chapel Street, New Haven, and Leverett became principal of the Washington School. About three years later they moved to 595 Chapel Street at which time Leverett was principal of the Dwight School. In 1884 the family moved again, to 1303 Chapel Street. at 1 Walter lived at home until his marriage in 1888.</p>
         <p>Camp prepared at Hopkins Grammar School, a noted institution founded in 1660, predating Yale College. It was located at that time on the northwest corner of High and Wall Streets where the Yale Law School is today. Camp usually stood 4th, 5th or 6th in a class of thirty-three. He entered Yale in 1876 and graduated in 1880 with an A.B. degree. As an undergraduate he was a member of Delta Kappa (a freshman Society), He Boule' (a sophomore Society), the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and Skull and Bones.</p>
         <p>Captain of the freshman baseball and football teams, Camp made several varsity teams while at Yale. He was an outstanding pitcher on the baseball nine, and one of the first to master the art of pitching a curve with a baseball. He also played shortstop and left field. He held the best individual record in fielding for shortstops in the old intercollegiate league (.897) and in batting (.627). His fame as a college player led to an offer, in 1884, by the National League of Baseball Clubs to become a member of the staff of league umpires. He was on the track team and is credited at Yale with inventing the hurdle step which was the beginning of the present technique of running instead of jumping hurdles. He rowed on the class crew, and won swimming races from short distances to five miles. He was a fine golfer and tennis player. But it was football that was to make him famous.</p>
         <p>The first game of college football under the old Rugby Union rules adopted by Yale and Harvard was played between Yale and Harvard in 1876, and Camp played half-back. This was the year he entered college, and though only seventeen years old, he made the team. Strong, quick with his hands and feet and a fast runner, he had a reputation as a good long distance punter and drop and place kicker. Two years later (1878) he was captain of the team, and again captain in 1879. Elected for the third time in 1880, while a student at the Yale Medical School, he stepped aside so that his friend Robert W. Watson, could be captain. In 1881, Franklin M. Eaton was captain but broke his collarbone in practice and Camp became captain for the third time. In 1882 a knee injury in practice ended Camp's playing days.</p>
         <p>As an undergraduate, Walter Camp's creative mind devised the "eleven", the "safety" as a scoring play, the "scrimmage" and the "quarterback." The year he was made captain of the team he attended the second convention of the old Intercollegiate Football Association which was then the football rules legislature. The change from fifteen to eleven players was proposed in 1878 and the safety as a scoring play in 1879. Both proposals were adopted the following year. It was at this same convention in 1880 that Camp succeeded in having the "scrimmage" adopted, probably the greatest single invention that had been made in any game. The old Rugby "scrum" gave neither side the orderly possession of the ball nor the right to put it into play. Camp's "scrimmage" gave the holder of the ball undisputed possession, and the player who received the ball from the snap-back was called the "quarterback".</p>
         <p>With his strong interest in anatomy, Camp entered the Yale Medical School in the fall of 1880. After two years, and passing all but two subjects for the M.D. degree, he left school, noting in a biographical questionnaire that "the death of a surgeon with whom I had expected to practice medicine caused me to leave the medical school and go into business."</p>
         <p>Upon leaving medical school, Walter Camp joined the sales department of the Manhattan Watch Company in New York City. After a year he was employed as a salesman in the New York office of the New Haven Clock Company. He steadily progressed through the selling end to the export department and thence to the position of assistant treasurer in the New Haven main office. He became treasurer and general manager in 1902, president in 1903, and finally chairman of the board.</p>
         <p>In 1888, Camp married Alice Graham Sumner, sister of William Graham Sumner, noted professor of political and social science at Yale, They had two children, Walter Camp, Jr. (1891) and Janet Camp Troxell (1897).</p>
         <p>Following graduation from Yale, Camp became deeply involved in intercollegiate football and for thirty years was known as the outstanding football legislator and coach in America. He was a member of every football rules committee and convention until his death, a period of almost fifty years. Although he never coached a Yale team, he was Yale's "advisory coach," a coach of the coaches, the unpaid chief mentor and arbiter. And when his clock business interfered, another Camp got into the coaching act; his wife "Allie" Camp attended daily practice. Notebook in hand, she trotted up and down the sidelines and every evening gave Walter a detailed rundown on what each player had done, or failed to do. Their house became Yale's nocturnal football headquarters for discussions and strategies with the football captain and key players.</p>
         <p>In 1882, to open up the game, Camp devised the revolutionary innovation by which, if a team had not advanced the ball five yards in three downs, the ball was turned over to the opponents on the spot of the fourth down. This was the rule which brought into the game the familiar "yards to gain," the cross lines of lime, and the name "gridiron." When asked how he would determine that the required number of yards had been made, Camp replied that he would line the field. "Gracious!" answered one of the members of the intercollegiate football rules committee, "the field will look like a gridiron." "Precisely," answered Camp.</p>
         <p>In 1889 Walter Camp began his famous All-America football team selections in the paper <emph render="italic">The</emph>
            <emph render="italic">Week's</emph>
            <emph render="italic">Sport</emph>, edited by Charles E. Clay with Caspar W. Whitney as manager. His primary purpose was to increase public interest in the game of football which at that time was little known. He devised a reporting system throughout the country whereby football experts, coaches and sports writers would recommend the top players in their area, with pertinent statistics. The 1889 selections were all from the Big Three, three from Harvard, five from Princeton, and three from Yale (Gill, Heffelfinger and Stagg). No other "All-America" selections have ever created the interest or commanded the respect of those made by Camp. His choices were copied in the sports pages of almost all newspapers in the United States. Walter Camp's daughter, Janet, remembers that there was always great secrecy about the selections and the family lived for a few weeks each year at that time as if surrounded by spies, so eager were the newsmen to obtain the names before publication. The All-America fad spread and in 1908 there were some 36 different teams chosen throughout the country. As attested by Harold "Red" Grange, the immortal "Galloping Ghost" of the University of Illinois, one of only a select few to be named to the Camp All-America team three times (1923, 1924 and 1925), "Camp was the No. 1 name in football; if you weren't on the Camp team, it didn't mean a thing." [1]</p>
         <p>Wholesale attacks upon football in the fall of 1892 on the grounds of brutality led to a strong demand from the public for the abolition of the game. Football had been discontinued at West Point and Annapolis and abolished at Harvard for one year. The attacks left parents of boys in an uncomfortable position as to what their duty was regarding playing the game. Early in 1893, Robert Bacon of the Harvard Board of Overseers asked Camp to chair a committee to look into the matter. The idea appealed to Camp and a committee composed of the Rev. Joseph Twichell of the Yale Corporation, the Rev. Endicott Peabody of Groton School, James W. Alexander of Princeton, the Hon. Henry E. Howland, Bacon and Camp attended a meeting in New York.</p>
         <p>A plan of investigation was submitted and authorized, involving a questionnaire to secure opinions from headmasters of schools having a football program, and from players and others at colleges throughout the country, about the game of football. The specific questions dealt with the type of injuries, if any, and the physical and mental effects of playing the game. There were suggestions for a reduction in mass and momentum plays and changes in playing rules looking toward an increased premium on an open kicking game. All suggestions were submitted by Camp to the football rules committee, and in 1894 the "flying" plays were banned but the mass plays were continued. The report of the investigating committee, with detailed results of the questionnaire, is in Series II, Writings.</p>
         <p>At the turn of the century, public clamor continued for opening up the game and resulted in more open play rules. One was the introduction of the forward pass; although Camp did not approve of it initially, upon its adoption he became the first coach to use it successfully. Another was increasing the five yards to be gained in three downs to ten yards in four downs, a change which had the unmistakeable imprint of Walter Camp's mind.</p>
         <p>Strong demands for the abolition of football from the public continued, however, and in 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt summoned Walter Camp and representatives from Harvard and Princeton to the White House and impressed upon them the necessity of meeting the public's reaction to football. For over ten years there had been periodic outcry against the roughness and brutality, and a demand for reform. Now the outcry swept across the country. The casualty list for the 1905 season was fearful. Eighteen had died and there were 149 serious injuries. Following the meeting, Camp and Alexander Moffat of Princeton came forward with a proposal that delegates from twenty-eight colleges meet in New York to pass resolutions for the preservation of football, to organize the National Collegiate Athletic Association and to appoint a football rules committee. In the making of the rules during the nineteen years that followed, and up to the very day of his death, Walter Camp was one of the dominating influences on the rules committee.</p>
         <p>Camp's contribution to athletics was by no means confined to football. He was the moving spirit in the direction of athletics at Yale for many years, serving for fifteen years as treasurer of Yale Field, also as chairman of the Athletic Committee, and graduate adviser in athletics. For a quarter of a century, Yale's athletic policy was his policy.</p>
         <p>He conceived and developed the system of one athletic treasury for all branches of sports, thus using receipts from football to support other sports which were not so popular with the public. As the treasurer of the Yale Financial Union, the athletic fund accumulated a surplus of more than $100,000.00 over a ten year period while other universities were having to make up a deficit for as large an amount.</p>
         <p>In 1908, Yale gave Walter Camp an honorary degree of Master of Arts as her athletic adviser. A letter from Anson Phelps Stokes, Secretary of the University, stated, "At a meeting of the Yale Corporation it was voted to confer upon you privatim the degree of Master of Arts; this vote being passed in accordance with the standing rule to confer an M.A. degree upon persons of the rank of Professor who have no degree higher than a Bachelor's." Everett Lake, Connecticut's Lieutenant Governor, a former Harvard half-back who served on the Yale Corporation, made the motion awarding the degree.</p>
         <p>And again, in 1915, Walter Camp was honored by his Alma Mater, when the Yale Corporation voted "to express the appreciation of the President and Fellows of the value of the services rendered by Mr. Camp to the University Corporation for the fifteen years during which he has served as Treasurer of Yale Field, Chairman of the Athletic Committee and Graduate Adviser in Athletics."</p>
         <p>In the late 1880's Walter Camp began his long career as a journalist, author and editor, and he became one of the three or four highest-paid non-fiction writers of his time in America. He wrote more than 250 articles, mostly on athletics and physical fitness, for some twenty magazines including <title render="italic">
               Collier's Weekly
            </title> (a regular contributor for over twenty-five years), <title render="italic">
               Harper's Weekly
            </title>, <emph render="italic">Outing</emph>, <title render="italic">
               Vanity Fair
            </title> and <emph render="italic">Youth's Companion</emph>.</p>
         <p>He was an editor for <title render="italic">
               Spalding's Official Football Guide
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               Boy's Magazine
            </title> and the <title render="italic">
               Yale Alumni Magazine
            </title> (until 1904). He wrote an untold number of articles for newspapers, including the <title render="italic">
               Philadelphia Public Ledger
            </title> and the <title render="italic">
               Consolidated Press Association
            </title> (1922-1924).</p>
         <p>Author of over thirty books from 1891-1921, all but seven were non-fiction. Best known of the non-fiction were <title render="italic">
               The Book of College Sports
            </title>,  <title render="italic">
               American Football
            </title>, and <title render="italic">
               Football Facts and Figures
            </title>. He edited a book series called "Library for Young People." Of the fiction, most popular were The Substitute and Jack Hall at Yale. His daughter remembers that "the orders just kept coming in for several years, and libraries were continually rebinding their copies." In addition, he collaborated with Everard Thompson, manager of the Ticket Department of the Yale University Football Association, in writing the "Frank Armstrong" series of six books of fiction. Camp used the pseudonym "Matthew M. Colton" rather than his own name because he considered the writing inferior to his other works. As a writer, Walter Camp was not a man who cared to have anything in print until it was as good as it could be made. The accurate technical knowledge in his books makes sports intelligible to outsiders and gives to athletes the authentic instruction of a successful coach. They stress principles of fair play, pluck, and honest persistence.</p>
         <p>A skillful phrase maker, Camp had a talent for expressing an idea in a few words, and many of his aphorisms were widely quoted. He also wrote much doggerel, but also some good flowing verse. As a Yale senior, he won both the Ivy Ode and the Class Poem competitions.</p>
         <p>On September 29, 1914, the following was printed in the most conspicuous place on the editorial page of the New York American newspaper:</p>
         <p>AMERICANS AWAKE! by Walter Camp</p>
         <p>Guard your shores and train your men,</p>
         <p>Teach your growing youth to fight;</p>
         <p>Make your plans ere once again</p>
         <p>Ships of foes appear in sight.</p>
         <p>Teach new arts until you hold</p>
         <p>In your bounds all things you need;</p>
         <p>Then you can't be bought or sold,</p>
         <p>From commercial bonds be freed!</p>
         <p>If Manhattan rich you'd save,</p>
         <p>If your western Golden Gate -</p>
         <p>Train a field force, rule the wave,</p>
         <p>Every day you're tempting fate!</p>
         <p>Build the ships and train to arms,</p>
         <p>Make your millions fighting strength,</p>
         <p>That shall frighten war's alarms</p>
         <p>Ere they reach a challenge length!</p>
         <p>Criticized by some, of course, as being militaristic, Camp's point was simply physical fitness for national preparedness. In April, 1917, just two and a half years later, he started the Senior Service Corps in New Haven. The Corps stressed physical fitness for men whose age was beyond that of active military service, and members devoted an hour a day three days a week to training consisting of setting-up drills (15 minutes) and marching (45 minutes). The Senior Service Corps quickly became a national movement with President Wilson as honorary president.</p>
         <p>During the strenuous days which followed entry into World War I, Camp was assigned the difficult task of keeping the overworked members of Wilson's cabinet and other high government officials in good physical condition. This group came to be known as "The Walter Scamps," and included Frank L. Polk, State Department, John W. Davis, Solicitor General, Thomas N. Gregory, Attorney General, Franklyn K. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, Daniel C. Roper, Tariff Commission, Paul Warburg, Federal Reserve Board, William B. Wilson, Secretary of Labor and Louis F. Post, Assistant Secretary, Oscar Crosby and Byron R. Newton, Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Edwin F. Sweet, Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Willard, Council of National Defense, Eustace Percy of the British Embassy, and others.</p>
         <p>Some months later, Camp was put in charge of the physical development in all training camps of the United States Navy, and was also made a physical director of the United States Air Service.</p>
         <p>During the war, Camp had been astonished and shocked by the high percentage of men rejected from service in the military due to physical unfitness. He confided to his friend, E. K. Hall, one-time chairman of the Football Rules Committee, that his greatest ambition was to help "to make the nation fit." Immediately after the war he set out to improve the situation with his famous health rules, "The Daily Dozen."</p>
         <p>Walter Camp did not copyright the Daily Dozen; he gave it away with no thought of personal gain. He knew he had the material for a profitable course in body-building. Yet, he accepted an invitation from John M. Siddall, editor of the <title render="italic">
               American Magazine
            </title>, to present the exercises in its pages. By doing so he had destroyed his own ownership; the twelve movements were now available to millions, and the modest check he received from <emph render="italic">American Magazine</emph>was a tiny fraction of what he would have made by selling them as a physical culture course. "I have never made any money except by my business, my investments and my books", he said. "Any attempt on my part to make money out of the Daily Dozen would be regarded as an effort to capitalize my reputation in amateur athletics. If pushed commercially it would make a fortune but I know it will help people in private as it helped the naval recruits and the men in Washington. I would rather give it away."</p>
         <p>The Daily Dozen exercises were published in newspapers, health magazines, physical culture manuals for schools, and broadsides from insurance companies and other businesses. More than 400,000 copies of a ten-cent pamphlet reprinted from <title render="italic">
               Collier's
            </title> were sold, with a modest royalty to Camp which he finally accepted after some hesitation. The exercises were included in Camp's book, "Keeping Fit All the Way," published by Harper and Brothers in 1919. In 1920 the Daily Dozen was the subject of a speech in the United States House of Representatives by Hon. John Q. Tilson and printed in the <title render="italic">
               Congressional Record
            </title>. And in 1921, near the end of his life, Camp wrote his last book, <title render="italic">
               The Daily Dozen
            </title>, published by the Reynolds Publishing Company. With an introduction by Dr. Samuel W. Lambert, eminent heart specialist, this book presented a great deal of Camp's philosophy of work and life.</p>
         <p>Walter Camp took a keen interest in civic, state and national affairs, holding various offices including the presidency of the Civic Federation, chairmanship of the Recreation Committee of the New Haven Chamber of Commerce, and the chairmanship of the Welfare Committee of the Connecticut Chamber of Commerce. He was treasurer and trustee of the Hopkins Grammar School for a number of years. Never interested in political office, he was nevertheless mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for mayor of New Haven. And following the war he was honored by His Majesty Alexander I, King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, who conferred upon him the Royal Decoration of the Order of Saint Sava IV "as a member of the Board of the Serbian Relief Fund."</p>
         <p>Waving his usual cheery "goodbye" from the sidewalk to his wife and daughter, Walter Camp left for New York on Friday, March 13, 1925, for a regular meeting of the Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee of which he was secretary. During an overnight intermission between sessions he succumbed to angina pectoris which overtook him in his bed at the Belmont Hotel. His body was found by William W. Roper, Princeton football coach, and W. S. Langford of Trinity College, who had been sent to the Belmont after Camp failed to appear for the morning's meeting. Funeral services were held on March 16th at his residence, 460 Humphrey Street. The services were private and interment was in the Grove Street cemetery.</p>
         <p>A memorial service was held at Battell Chapel at Yale on Monday of the 1925 Commencement Week. Addresses were made by Professor Charles W. Kennedy of Princeton, Dean LeBaron Russell Briggs of Harvard, and by Professor William Lyon Phelps of Yale. The last speaker was President Emeritus Arthur Twining Hadley, a friend of some forty years, who recalled Camp's breadth of intellectual interest, his high ideals of sportsmanship, and his clear-headed decisions on questions of athletic policy during the years Camp served Yale as Graduate Advisor in Athletics.</p>
         <p>On November 3, 1928, at the Yale-Dartmouth football game, Yale dedicated the Walter Camp Memorial Gateway, a massive colonnade, erected at the entrance to the Yale playing fields, bearing his name in great blocks of stone. Designed by John W. Cross, Yale 1900, the cost ($300,000.00) was met by Yale alumni and matching funds from the National Collegiate Athletic Association on behalf of other universities, colleges and preparatory schools where football was played. Upon bronze tablets set into the walls flanking the arch appear, by states, the names of 224 colleges and 279 preparatory and high schools all over the nation that contributed to the memorial honoring the memory of the Father of American Football.</p>
         <p>The widespread participation in the erection of this memorial was far more than a mere recognition of Walter Camp's noteworthy contribution to football and other sports. It represented a very real endorsement of the high standard of sportsmanship which Camp championed.</p>
         <p>[1] Following Camp's death, All-America teams were selected by Grantland Rice until 1948. The Walter Camp Football Foundation resumed the selection in 1967.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The writings of Walter Camp constitute the second major portion of papers and are arranged by topic or type in six categories: athletics, physical fitness, general writings, aphorisms, poetry and miscellaneous writings. Articles on athletics, particularly football, and on physical fitness, are in the majority.</p>
               <p>Agreements and contracts with publishers, and reviews of some of his books, are also included in this series.</p>
               <p>Camp's poetry and aphorisms are largely undated and are not arranged in any particular order or by subject.</p>
               <p>Throughout the several sections of Series II is background material used by Walter Camp in preparing his articles, particularly on athletics and physical fitness. Consisting for the most part of articles written by others, statistics, etc., these folders are listed as "Research notes" in this register.</p>

               <p>Some 20,000 newspaper and magazine clippings make up Series III. Because of the fragile condition of the newsprint, dating back to 1866, disintegration caused approximately 10 per cent to be lost in processing.</p>
               <p>Arranged as far as possible by years, the clippings are divided into two classifications, Athletics and General. Researchers will find a great many of these clippings undated and, in some cases, the legibility poor.</p>
               <p>One scrapbook of clippings on the death of Walter Camp is in Series V, Family Papers.</p>
               <p>After the Camp papers were microfilmed, in 1982, the newspaper and magazine clippings in this series were discarded. They are available now on reels 41-45 of the Walter Camp Papers on MICROFILM HM 137.</p>

               <p>Photographs of Walter Camp and the Camp family are at the beginning of Series IV, followed by pictures of several activities and subjects with which he was closely associated, e.g., The Daily Dozen and physical fitness. For the most part, however, the photographs concern athletics, particularly football games and players.</p>
