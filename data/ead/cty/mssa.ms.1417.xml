         <p>Roland Arthur Paul, Jr. was born January 19, 1937, in Memphis, Tennessee. He received his undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1958 and his LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1961. From 1962-1964 Paul worked in the Pentagon, first in the office of International Security Affairs and then as Special Assistant to the General Counsel, John McNaughton. In 1965 he joined the Council on Foreign Relations, and from 1969-1970 he served as counsel of the Senate Subcommittee on U.S. Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. In 1973 Rutgers University Press published Paul's first book, American Military Commitments Abroad, which details the international scene during the late 1960s. Paul began private legal practice in the early 1970s.</p>
