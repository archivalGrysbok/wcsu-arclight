         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Anne Ramsay Somers Papers consist of 10 linear feet of office files which contain correspondence, project files, and writings. They extend from 1955 to 1978, although the bulk of the papers covers the years 1960 to 1978.</p>
         <p>The Somers Papers are incomplete; they contain no material documenting her academic appointments. In addition, they provide only limited information on her service in professional organizations, on her work as a consultant, and on her membership on the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council. The papers do, however, contain correspondence with a number of significant figures in health care and health policy, and they provide extensive coverage of her publications and speeches. The papers are organized in three series: GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE, WRITINGS, and PROJECT FILES.</p>
         <p>Series I GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE is arranged alphabetically and dates primarily from the mid 1960s through 1978. The series contains exchanges with acquaintances, colleagues, professional organizations, public officials and others, and it covers a wide range of areas in health and health policy. Somers corresponded with important figures in public health and health economics such as: Odin W. Anderson, Robert M. Ball, Frederick W. Brown, Wilbur J. Cohen, Melvin A. Glasser, Philip R. Lee, James Mackenzie, Robert J. Myers, Ernest W. Saward, Robert M. Sigmond. Her exchanges with Brown, Du Val, Glasser, Lee and Myers contain lengthy, informal discussions of her views on health care and health insurance. However, most of the series is limited to one or a few exchanges with specific correspondents or is routine in nature.</p>
         <p>Series II, WRITINGS, is divided into two sections,<emph render="italic">Monographs</emph>and<emph render="italic">Speeches and Shorter Writings</emph>.<emph render="italic">Monographs</emph>is arranged chronologically by title and covers books and book chapters which Somers authored or co-authored between 1960 and 1977. The section includes drafts, outlines, correspondence, reviews and other items.</p>
         <p>The<emph render="italic">Speeches and Shorter Writings</emph>section spans the years 1968 to 1977, although most of the material dates from 1969 to 1974. The section is arranged chronologically by the date papers were first presented or published. Revisions of papers which were subsequently published or presented (including those with variant titles) are filed with the original version of the paper. The section includes speech texts, reprints, tear sheets, and correspondence. The major topics represented are hospital administration, the role of hospitals in health care, consumer health education, and health insurance.</p>
         <p>Series III, PROJECT FILES, dates from 1966 to 1979 and covers a variety of Somers' professional activities, including organizations, conferences, and panels on which she served; consulting work; informal consultations with colleagues; and production of a television series on health services organization, financing and health consumerism. The series also includes a few materials from her appointment to the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council.</p>
         <p>The series includes more than twenty separate organizations and projects, although the coverage for each is very limited. Most of the activities described in the series relate to consumer health education.</p>
         <p>The papers are part of the Contemporary Medical Care and Health Policy Collection, which also includes the papers of Somers' husband, Herman M. Somers (Ms. Group No. 1238).</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Anne Ramsay Somers, educator, author, and consultant, has been an influential figure in American public health policy, hospital administration, prepaid health insurance plans, and consumer health education. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1913, she was educated at Vassar College (B.A., 1935) and the University of North Carolina (1939-1940). Her early interests were labor economics and industrial relations, and she served as educational director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union from 1937 to 1942 and as a labor economist with the U.S. Department of Labor from 1943 to 1946.</p>
         <p>In 1947, she married Herman Miles Somers, then an economist at the U.S. Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, and spent the next seven years studying and raising a family. In 1954 she and her husband published <title render="italic">
               Workmen's Compensation
            </title>, their first collaborative work. The study was the first to fully emphasize the importance of the health benefits provided under Workmen's Compensation. After 1954 the Somers became gradually more involved in the area of health economics and in 1957 Anne was appointed a research associate (1957-1963) at Haverford College, where her husband was professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science (1948-1963).</p>
         <p>They published a second joint work on health care, <title render="italic">
               Doctors, Patients, and Health Insurance
            </title>, in 1961. As the first modern full-scale exposition of the organization and financing of health care in the United States, the monograph was widely acclaimed and brought them a great deal of recognition.</p>
         <p>During the 1960s and 1970s Anne Somers published a succession of incisive and influential studies of American health care and health policy: <title render="italic">
               Medicare and the Hospitals
            </title>, 1967, with Herman Somers; <title render="italic">
               Health Care in Transition
            </title>, 1971; <title render="italic">
               and Health and Health Care: Policies in Perspective
            </title>, 1977, with Herman Somers. Anne Somers has also published in the field of hospital administration and has conducted studies exploring new areas of health policy such as geriatrics, health education, violence, and various aspects of preventive medicine.</p>
         <p>Besides her extensive work as a consultant in the public and private sectors, Somers has served as a research associate in the Industrial Relations Section, Princeton University, since 1964 and as professor of community and family medicine, College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Rutgers Medical School since 1971. From 1972 to 1974 she was also director of the Office of Consumer Health Education, College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and she has participated in policy making and administration in a variety of other positions, including one term as a member of the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council (1972-1975).</p>
