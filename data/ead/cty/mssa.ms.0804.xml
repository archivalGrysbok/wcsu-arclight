         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Kent State Collection in Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library, originated with the efforts of Peter Davies, author of <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Truth about Kent State
            </title>, and his friend Paul Keane to find a safe repository for the material that Mr. Davies had created and collected in the course of his research. The major part of the the papers came to Yale on the seventh anniversary of the May 4, 1970, killings, and the Yale Political Union commemorated that gift by sponsoring a five-day colloquium featuring such civil libertarians as Henry Steele Commager and Aryeh Neier as well as Davies, Keane, and others who had long been studying and protesting what happened at Kent State. Since then the library has endeavored to build on this foundation by collecting other relevant manuscripts, but Davies' papers remain the core of the Collection.</p>
         <p>The largest quantity of unique material in the Kent State Collection is Peter Davies' correspondence, beginning with his protest to President Nixon on May 8 and spanning seven strenuous years of inquiry, agitation, and organization. This is, above all, a record of the impact of Kent State on Davies and his correspondents: the parents of the victims, the public officials from whom he demanded an accounting, and the citizens who shared his outrage and collaborated in his protests and probings. The letters document in extraordinary detail the development of Davies' understanding of what happened at Kent State and the progress of his collaborative efforts to obtain redress through public opinion and the legal system. In addition, there are notes, drafts, and unpublished writings that add considerably to the public record of his analysis.</p>
         <p>The Kent State Collection also contains a large quantity of research material that would be very useful in a fresh inquiry into Kent State and its aftermath. These are the major kinds of material: two feet of newspaper clippings, spanning from 1970 to 1978; several thousand pages of photostatic copies of F. B. I. Documents, purchased by Yale under the Freedom of Information Act; many publication from Kent State, including newspapers, yearbooks, leaflets, and commemorative booklets; and briefs, transcripts, and other documents related to various legal proceedings. These materials thoroughly document the public perception of Kent State, and give easy access to much information that is otherwise available only in widely scattered sources.</p>

               <p>Received from David E. Engdahl, 1989.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The accession consists of the records of David E. Engdahl, attorney on the legal team for plaintiffs in the civil suits that arose from the shooting incidents at Kent State University, May 4, 1970. The bulk of the records pertain to <emph render="italic">Krause et al. v. Rhodes et al.</emph> and related cases, which were in litigation from 1970 to 1981. The case was tried twice, first in 1975 and finally in 1978. A settlement was reached in 1979, but there were subsequent appeals related to the payment of attorney's fees and the protective order issued in 1976. These appeals were tried in 1981. In addition to motions, orders, and correspondence with the court, the records include correspondence among counsel, news clippings, notes, and background materials. Engdahl collected and attempted to publish poems commemorating the deaths at Kent State, which are included in the accession.</p>
               <p>Of particular interest to researchers are the extensive photographic documentation that Engdahl compiled on behalf of the plaintiffs and the testimony, memoranda, and motions related to the use of photographs as evidence. Several photographers served as witnesses in the trials, and a great deal of testimony was oriented around photographs and maps.</p>
               <p>The accession is arranged under seven headings: Legal, Background Materials, General Correspondence, Clippings, Photographs, Audiotapes, and Poetry.</p>
               <p>The Legal files are mainly related to <emph render="italic">Krause et al. v. Rhodes et al</emph>., but contain records for other cases directly related or topically relevant to the events at Kent State University. Records pertaining to <emph render="italic">Krause et al. v. Rhodes et al.</emph> are organized in chronological order. Other cases are organized in rough chronological order.</p>
               <p>The Background Materials are arranged alphabetically in six sections. Biographical background materials contain notes, clippings and other materials about defendants, witnesses, and jurors collected by Engdahl in preparation for trials. Reports contain background materials prepared by agencies, expert witnesses or individuals and presented as such. Topical background files contain notes, clippings, and other materials organized alphabetically by topic. The witness testimony index is a collation of testimonies, depositions, interviews, and statements from various sources. Writings are mostly Engdahl's, but also contain drafts from other writers.</p>
               <p>General Correspondence is organized alphabetically by correspondent and topic. Much of this correspondence relates to legal strategy, relations among plaintiffs and counsel, and public relations surrounding the trials. Correspondence with the court is generally filed with legal papers. Most correspondence regarding poetry and photography is filed with those materials rather than in general correspondence.</p>
               <p>Clippings are organized topically and then chronologically.</p>
               <p>Photographs are organized by format. Engdahl gathered reprints from many photographers who witnessed the events of May 4. He collated these into the plaintiffs' exhibits, juxtaposed to photographer perspective maps. Engdahl also assembled and organized the photographs in sequence to show the chronology of events on May 4 (boxes 51-52). Many of these photographs are published elsewhere, but the collection contains a significant number of photographs that have not been widely distributed.</p>
