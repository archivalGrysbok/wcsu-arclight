         <p>The Noyes Family Papers consist of correspondence, memorabilia, and printed matter relating to Atherton and Edward Parish Noyes and their families. The bulk of the papers is made up of letters written by the brothers to each other and to other family members and friends. Included is correspondence from their years at Yale University (Edward was a member of the class of 1880, Atherton of the class of 1885) and their later lives; in particular there are numerous letters from Atherton describing his life in Colorado from 1887 on, and his visit to Europe in 1894-1895. As well as correspondence, the papers contain a good deal of Yale memorabilia and some other printed matter, and several photographs of Atherton.</p>
         <p>The papers of the two brothers have beenseparated, and their correspondence arranged chronologically. Letters between the two are filed under the author's name. These papers were acquired by Yale University by purchase and gift from LeRoy E. Wilson in 1976.</p>

         <p>Edward Parish Noyes</p>
         <p>Son of Rev. Daniel Parker Noyes (B.A. Yale 1840), Tutor in Yale College from 1843 to 1847, and Helen McGregor (Means) Noyes, was born September 26, 1857, in New York City, where his father was then secretary of the American (now Congregational) Home Missionary Society. During his boyhood he also lived at Orange, N. J., and Brookline and Rockport, Mass. He was prepared for college at Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass.</p>
         <p>After graduation he learned the machinist's trade in the Lowell (Mass.) Machine Shops, studying especially the construction of cotton machinery. He spent considerable time for the company in the South superintending the equipment of cotton mills, especially in South Carolina and Tennessee, continuing this line of work until 1884, when he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and took a special one-year course. For nine years following he was connected with the Neverslip Horseshoe Co. of Boston, and after that was treasurer of the Hancock Inspirator Co. until July, 1896. Since then he had been an expert in mechanical engineering, his office being in Boston and his residence since 1892 in Winchester.</p>
         <p>Mr. Noyes died suddenly of heart trouble at his home in Winchester, September 20, 1913, in the 56th year of his age.</p>
         <p>He married, November 7, 1891, in Hastings, England, Jessie Porter Hill, daughter of Richard and Harriet (Winter) Hill, of Davenport, Ia. She died July 22, 1897, but two daughters and a son survived him. A brother (B.A. Yale 1885) is Assistant Professor of English in Colorado College.</p>
