         <p>The Sheffield Scientific School, like the Graduate School, had its origins in the Department of Philosophy and the Arts established in 1847. It was given its name by the Yale Corporation in 1861 in recognition of the support of Joseph Earl Sheffield of New Haven who not only gave the first building but also provided funds for its equipment and development. Subsequently he made other gifts and finally bequeathed to a corporation, the Board of Trustees of the Sheffield S cientific School, a substantial endowment which was to be held and adninistered by the Trustees for the benefit of the natural, physical, and mathematical sciences in Yale University.</p>
         <p>Sheffield was one of the first schools of higher education in the United States to devote its curriculum specifically to scientific training. The School played an important part in the evolution of American higher learning from the strict classical model of education t o a curriculum which encompassed a liberal scientific education.</p>
         <p>The faculty of the School conducted graduate as well as undergraduate courses i n the sciences and engineering until 1919 when the former were discontinued. In 1932, engineering instruction was transferred to the newly organized Yale School of Engineering. In 1945 Sheffield resumed its original function of teaching at the graduate level. Under the general administration of the Graduate School, its faculty furnished instruction to graduate students in the sciences and mathematics who were M.A. and Ph.D. candidates. In 1956 the School's functions were absorbed by the Graduate School. The Directors of Sheffield Scientific School were: George Jarvis Brush, 1872-1898; Russell Henry Chittenden, 1898-1922; Charles Hyde Warren, 1922-1945; Edmund Ware Linnott, 1945-1956.</p>

               <p>Historical Papers contains materials relating to the Sheffield Scientific School's early development: correspondence, the Articles of Incorporation of the Board of Trustees and bequest information among others. Because of their size and nature the historical papers were arbitrarily pulled together into a combined chronological and alphabetical subsection. Legal Matters re: Trustee Property contains deeds for land and buildings and agreements for building use by others. Building Construction and Maintenance contains contracts and related papers for construction, renovation and upkeep of the buildings. Legal Documents re: Funds contains materials relating to donations of land and money. Materials in the George St. John Sheffield Bequest section include the will, inventories, correspondence and financial and tax matters. The Amelia Daggett Sheffield Estate section contains materials regarding the estate settlement and distribution: the will., inventories, appraisals and release forms. The George Sheffield Fund material includes correspondence, financial papers and reports summarizing fund supported research from 1938-1952.</p>

               <p>Endowed in 1901, the Silliman Memorial Lectureship funded an annual series of lectures "the general tendency of which may be such as will illustrate the presence and wisdom of God as manifested in the Natural and Moral World." After presentation, the guest expanded his material into book form to be published by the Sheffield Scientific School. Series V, SILLIMAN LECTURES 1906, 1911-1956, contains the administrative data compiled by the Silliman Lecture Committee, Materials include correspondence suggesting lecturers, invitations, acceptances, declinations, Corporation votes affirming lecturers, correspondence discussing lecture topics and material re : publication of the manuscripts. See Appendix 2 for a list of Silliman Lecturers.</p>
               <p>The materials in Series V are arranged in three sections: Lecturers, Invited Lecturers Who Did Not Accept or Were Unable to Attend, and Suggested Lecturers. The materials within each section are arranged chronologically according to the academic year the Silliman Lecture was given.</p>
