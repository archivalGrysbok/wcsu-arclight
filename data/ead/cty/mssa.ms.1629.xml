         <p>Known as "TGB" to most of his students and associates, Thomas Goddard Bergin was an eminent twentieth-century American scholar of Italian literature. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 17, 1904, the only child of Joseph and Irvinea Jane Frances Goddard Bergin. Joseph Bergin had graduated from Yale University in 1896 and received his M.D. there in 1899. Thomas Bergin went to New Haven High School prior to attending Yale, where he received a B.A. in 1925 and a Ph.D. in romance languages in 1929. Bergin married Florence Bullen of Wailasey (Cheshire, England) on December 30, 1929. They had two children, Winifred and Jennifer.</p>
         <p>Bergin began his teaching career at Yale College as an instructor of Italian from 1925 until 1930. He taught at Flora Stone Mather College of Western Reserve University from 1930 to 1935 as an associate professor of Spanish and Italian. Bergin then moved to the New York State Teachers College in Albany, where he served, from 1935 until 1941, as a professor of romance languages. From 1941 to 1948, Bergin was at Cornell University as both professor of romance languages and curator of the Fiske Dante-Petrarch Collections. He also served for a time as chairman of the Division of Literature and acting chairman of the Department of English.</p>
         <p>In February 1943, Bergin was appointed head instructor at the United States School of Military Government at Charlottesville, Virginia. Between November 1943 and 1946 Major Bergin was assigned to the headquarters of the Allied Control Commission in Italy, where he served as director of public relations. For his wartime service, Bergin was decorated with the Order of Civil Merit and the Orders of Santi Maurizio e Lazzaro and Corona D'Italia from Italy, and the Order of the British Empire.</p>
         <p>Bergin became head of the Spanish and Italian Department at Yale in 1949 and was made the Benjamin Barge Professor of the Romance Languages and Literature in the same year. He was master of Timothy Dwight College from 1953 until 1968, except for the year 1956 when Bergin was a Fulbright Scholar in Italy. He was made the Sterling Professor of Romance Languages and Literature in 1957 and upon retirement in July 1973, became Sterling Professor Emeritus. Memoirs related to his Yale years appear as a chapter entitled "My Native Country" in <title render="italic">
               My Harvard, My Yale
            </title> (1982), edited by Diana Dubois.</p>
         <p>Bergin was an authority on Boccacciot Dantet Petrarch, and the Provenyal troubadours. He also specialized in the study of more modern Italian writers, especially Alberto Moravi, Quasimodo Salvatoret Giovanni Verga, and Giambattista Vico. Besides textbooks and scholarly monographs on French, Italian, Spanish, and Provenyal subjects, including three one-volume Syntheses on Boccacciot Dantet and Petrarch, Bergin published biographies of Italian writers and poets, in English and Italian, and edited <title render="italic">
               The Taming of the Shrew
            </title> for the Yale Shakespeare series (1954). He also produced translations of several prominent Italian writers and poets, most notably Dante's <title render="italic">
               Divine Comedy
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               Inferno
            </title> (1948), <title render="italic">
               Paradise
            </title> (1954), and<title render="italic">
               Purgatory
            </title> (1953). Other notable translations include Niccolo Machiavelli's<title render="italic">
               Prince
            </title> (1947) and Vico's <title render="italic">
               New Science
            </title> (1948; rev. ed. 1961) with Max Fisch. Bergin compiled, with Ernest H. Wilkins, the indispensable <title render="italic">
               Concordance to the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri
            </title> (1965) for the Dante Society of America. He was also a poet in his own right; some of his poems were collected and edited by A. Bartlett Giamatti and T. K. Swing in <title render="italic">
               Masterpieces From the Files of T.G.B.
            </title> (1964). Bergin also wrote many articles and book reviews for such publications as <title render="italic">
               Colliers Encyclopedia
            </title>, <title render="italic">
               The Freeman

               Italian Quarterly
            </title>, <title render="italic">

            </title> and the <title render="italic">
               Yale Review
            </title>. He created the Dante Shelf for <title render="italic">
               Italian Quarterly
            </title> to review new material on Dante. The bibliography of his works in <title render="italic">
               Italian Literature: Roots and Branches. Essays in Honor of Thomas Goddard Bergin
            </title>, edited by Giose Rimanelli and Kenneth J. Atchity (1976), includes thirty-seven books, fifteen contributions to books, fifty articles in periodicals, and nearly 500 book reviews.</p>
         <p>Bergin played an extremely active part in the 1965 septicentennial celebrations of Dante's birth. He organized a Dante conference at Yale and edited the conference papers, which were published as <title render="italic">
               From Time to Eternity
            </title>. He also lectured widely during the course of the year long observance.</p>
         <p>Bergin was also a Yale historian, author of a history of the residential colleges, and a football enthusiast who vigorously promoted the Yale football team for some twenty years. In "Time and Change," his column for the <title render="italic">
               Yale Alumni Magazine
            </title>, Bergin addressed many areas of Yale life and history and chronicled the fortunes of the Yale team. He also wrote <title render="italic">
               Gridiron Glory
            </title> (1978), recounting the fortunes of the Yale football team from 1952 to 1972 and a history of the Harvard Yale football confrontation called <title render="italic">
               The Game: the Harvard-Yale Football Rivalry, 1875-1983
            </title> (1984).</p>
         <p>Bergin belonged to the American Association of Teachers of Italian (serving as its president in 1947), the Medieval Academy of America, the Dante Society of America, the American Association of University Professors (he was the president of the Yale chapter from 1951 to 1952), and PEN, the international organization of poets, essayists, and novelists. He received honorary degrees from Hofstra College in 1958 and the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1984.</p>
         <p>Bergin died on October 30, 1987, at the age of eighty-two, at his home in Madison, Connecticut. Yale honored him posthumously by establishing the Thomas Bergin scholarships for Italian majors in 1989. Timothy Dwight College, furthermore, renamed its dining room in his honor.</p>

               <p>This series consists primarily of professional correspondence, which documents Bergin's career in academe for the years 1930-1972. The files are arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent and may include letters to or from a third party, but all such letters relate in some manner to the primary individual or institution named. Correspondence in other series has been cross-referenced.</p>
               <p>Bergin's correspondence with academic colleagues both at Yale University and elsewhere, and with professional organizations, publishing companies and granting agencies comprises the bulk of the series. The files include correspondence between Bergin and his publishers, Appleton-Century-Crofts and Southern Illinois University Press; fellow Italianists like Sergio Pacifici; and scholarly journals such as <title render="italic">
                     Classic Features
                  </title> and <title render="italic">
                     La Fiera Letteraria
                  </title>. There are also several folders of Bergin's professional correspondence with well-known scholars of his day, including Mark Musa and Ernest H. Wilkins, as well as with prominent members of the Dante Society of America, such as Anthony J. DeVito.</p>
               <p>This series also documents Bergin's membership in various social clubs and organizations, both in New Haven (the Graduate Club and the Elizabethan Club) and beyond (the Cornell Club, the Andrew Morehouse Trust Association, Inc., and the Savile Club) and underscores Bergin's active membership in international associations. These include PEN and the Institute of Intemational Education, as well as national associations such as the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Association of University Professors and the Author's League of America, Inc. Correspondence relating to Bergin's Fulbright scholarship is documented in folders 4 and 20, and in correspondence with the United States Department of State in folder 84.</p>
               <p>The series includes few strictly personal letters and most of these relate to Bergin's earlier years. Such exchanges are found in the files for Bergin's wife, Florence; sister, E. B. McKenny; and friend, A. B. Canaperia. There is a run of personal letters in "Unidentified," found at the end of the series, written between 1944 and 1945 from an anonymous acquaintance in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is divided into three sections: lectures and addresses, published writings, and unpublished writings. The bulk of the writings are from the twenty-five years that Bergin spent at Yale as a professor of romance languages, 1948-1973. The series does not document all of Bergin's scholarly writings during this period nor his extensive publications on Yale.</p>
               <p>The lectures and addresses in the first section are arranged alphabetically by the name of the institution at which Bergin spoke. Most date from 1965, when Bergin delivered numerous lectures in many American universities in celebration of the Dante septicentennial. The folders usually contain both correspondence and typescripts of the lecture that Bergin gave at the institution concerned. The text of a lecture may have been delivered at more than one institution.</p>
               <p>The second section, published writings, contains typescripts and handwritten drafts for several of Bergin's major books, including the <title render="italic">
                     Concordance to the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri
                  </title> with Ernest Wilkins (1965), Bergin's handbook on <title render="italic">
                     Dante
                  </title> (1965), <title render="italic">
                     A Diversity of Dante
                  </title> (1969), and Bergin's translations of major works by Dante and Petrarch (induding the letters, <title render="italic">
                     Bucolicum Carmen
                  </title>, in Latin). There is also much correspondence between Bergin and publishers and scholars with whom he collaborated in his writing projects. This section also includes book reviews that Bergin wrote for scholarly and literary journals and three folders of original poems. Bergin's many poems in the New Haven daily newspapers were signed under the pseudonym "Tom Goddard" or the anagram "Homer N. Bigstag." The files in this section are arranged in alphabetical order by title.</p>
               <p>The final section, unpublished writings, is small. It includes a rejected article from the <title render="italic">
                     Virginia Quarterly Review
                  </title>, an unidentified, annotated manuscript on Sir Thomas More, and miscellaneous verse.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>This series is arranged in five sections. They are: Dante septicentennial, Italian literature, Yale University, Personal, and Photographs.</p>
               <p>The first section, which relates to the celebration of the Dante septicentennial, consists of correspondence and other documentation bearing upon Yale's commemoration of the 700th anniversary of Dante's birth in October, 1965. The materials in this section document Bergin's organization of a conference as Yale's tribute to Dante. Bergin attempted to ensure that Yale's Dante scholars featured prominently at the conference. He was only partly successful since several Yale faculty members declined Bergin's offer to lecture. There is correspondence and both draft and final versions of the lectures originally delivered October 4-20 at Yale by Kenelm Foster, Thomas Greene, Raffaello Morghen, Giorgio Petrocchi, Natalino Sapegno, and Aldo Scaglione. Other material relates to Bergin's efforts to edit and publish the lectures, which eventually appeared as <title render="italic">
                     From Time to Eternity: Essays on Dante's Comedy
                  </title> (1967). In this effort he had the support of George Pierson, the chairman of the university's Division of the Humanities, and Yale University Press and its editor, Chester Kerr. Bergin's report for the Division of the Humanities can be found in folder 13, while materials in folder 2 document Bergin's collaboration with Vincenzo Cioffari, the national chairman of the Dante Centenary Committee, and Connecticut Representative Robert N. Giamo to prepare a bill commissioning the United States Post Office to issue a commemorative Dante stamp.</p>
               <p>The second section contains files which document Bergin's research in Italian literature throughout most his career. It consists of Bergin's handwritten and typed notes on the works of several prominent Italian writers, such as Alberto Moravia, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Torquato Tasso. Files typically contain chapter summaries and select notes from secondary sources on a particular work of literature, for example Machiavelli's <title render="italic">
                     Mandragola
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>The section "Yale University" documents Bergin's administrative roles at Yale, especially his involvement with the Yale Alumni Association, his duties as chairman of the Spanish and Italian Department (1949-1958), Master of Timothy Dwight College (1953-1968), and chairman of the Committee on Area Studies (1950-1953). The bulk of the material in this section dates from the 1950s.</p>
               <p>The last two sections, Personal and Photographs, include correspondence relating to the estate of Bergin's sister, Hortense G. Hanly, who died in Naugatuck, Connecticut, on April 23, 1965 and Christmas cards from friends. There are also a few photographs of Bergin and his acquaintances.</p>
