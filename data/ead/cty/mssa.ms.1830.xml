         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Christopher Phillips Papers were appraised, arranged, and described solely by the donor and creator, Christopher Phillips. The papers are arranged in series that mark major periods in his life; in total they provide documentation from his birth in 1950 onward.</p>
         <p>Each series description is comprised of two sections: Dates and Events, and Personal and Larger Themes. Both sections provide critical information that assists the researcher in placing materials within the series in their proper context. When read in their entirety, the series descriptions provide a fairly comprehensive biographical essay on Phillips. Most, but not all, entries in the Dates and Events, and/or the Personal and Larger Themes sections have some documentation in the Papers. See "Introduction to the Papers" below for an important and insightful statement by Phillips describing his assemblage of the collection and themes represented in it.</p>
         <p>In terms of substantive genres of materials in the collection, the most important are those generated by Phillips himself. His letters are found throughout the collection and often provide detailed descriptions of both his personal and professional lives. Interesting interviews with Phillips at various points in his life include one regarding his 1981/1982 year on the road in Asia; 1986 interviews in which he tells the story of his life up to that point; and psychic readings beginning in the late 1970s during which Phillips converses with various psychics about personal and professional matters.  All of the interviews are on cassette (see individual series descriptions regarding restrictions on use of original cassettes).</p>
         <p>Materials that document or reflect Phillips' life as a gay man include his letters and those written to him by gay friends, a wide range of gay ephemera from around the world, and particularly interesting assorted administrative materials that document the Gay Community Services Center of Los Angeles in its early years. Folders that contain gay materials exclusively have descriptions that begin with the word "Gay." Phillips notes throughout the descriptions of materials when they concern a gay person who, in his view, is particularly important and deserves further study. (See "Gay researchers note!" for these notations.)</p>
         <p>Materials on Phillips' interest and involvement with the Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) Movement within Judaism include detailed letters, teaching materials, and printed materials.  There are also notes on, and cassettes of, lectures by prominent rabbis, especially at Ohr Somayach yeshiva in Jerusalem.</p>
         <p>Phillips' various editorial positions (magazines and books) are documented through letters (including exchanges with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at Doubleday) and writings (both published and unpublished). Documentation on a new edition of<emph render="italic">Self Portrait</emph>by Man Ray, one of Phillips' most important ventures in the publishing industry, includes an interview conducted by Phillips of Juliet Man Ray and her brother Joe Browner. In addition, there are a number of photographs Phillips commissioned of the interior of the Man Ray studio in Paris and copies of Man Ray photographs that were never published.  For a book idea he was pursuing, Phillips obtained copies of interviews with prominent Israeli women of achievement conducted by Jerusalem sociologist Beverly Mizrachi.  During the interviews the women talk about the development of their personal and professional lives.</p>
         <p>Phillips' interest in Asia is reflected in ephemera from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, India, and parts of coastal Sri Lanka that were devastated by the 2004 tsunami.  In addition there are assorted materials documenting the beginning of Asian-American studies at American universities and unpublished interviews with three Japanese-American leaders concerning World War II Japanese-American relocation camps.</p>
         <p>Life in prestigious private schools in both the United States (Collegiate School) and England (Eton and Mill Hill School) is documented through Phillips' letters, collected ephemera, and course materials.  Upper middle-class summer camp life is described in Phillips' letters, counselors' reports, and collected ephemera.</p>

               Introduction to the Papers
            </title>
         </p>
         <p>by</p>
         <p>Christopher Phillips</p>
         <p>This first installment of the Christopher Phillips Papers covers the period from my birth, on December 19, 1950, until February 13, 1991, when I moved back to New York after an absence of 23 years.</p>
         <p>I have assiduously - to put it mildly - saved papers and documents since I was at least nine years old. And judging by the amount of material that has survived from my earliest childhood, my parents were great savers of things as well.</p>
         <p>The boxes contain just about every piece of paper that has come my way - letters, receipts, school work, tickets, daily schedules, intriguing bits of stationery and atmospheric ephemera of various kinds.  When I discovered the photocopier, I began adding copies of every letter I sent out, as well.</p>
         <p>This installment of the archives traces the course of a modern gay life from childhood in Manhattan through Yale, the gay movement, and various lives in Edinburgh, Los Angeles, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Jerusalem and London.   The next installments are to cover the period from 1991 until the present and into the future.</p>
         <p>While particular parts of this collection illustrate various times and places, I think the main value of this story might well be cumulative.</p>
         <p>I believe that, taken as a whole, what these papers chiefly show is the evolution of a gay soul in the process of liberation.  I once heard quoted a member of the great Paris generation who was asked to sum up his life.  He responded, "I was 20 when the century was 20."  For my part, I came of age when my gay tribe came of age.  I was 18 in the summer of 1969, when the Stonewall Riots gave birth to the modern gay movement.  There is no way to exaggerate the importance of this event for me personally: I owe my freedom and happiness to it.  And indeed, I plunged into the gay movement the moment I could find it, in October 1969, at the first meeting of the first gay group at Yale.</p>
         <p>There are many gay themes in this collection.  To begin with, the impulse to document and preserve history has been a traditional role for gay people, who have been the record-keepers and saga-makers in numerous cultures since time immemorial.  If anyone doubts this, just look at the number of gay men in antiques shops, in museums, in historic preservation.  The title of a recent book (by Will Fellows, University of Wisconsin Press, 2004) says it all:<emph render="italic">A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture.</emph> I agree with its premise that curating is a natural role for gay men to adopt.</p>
         <p>A related gay theme has been my closeness with people one or two generations older than myself.  This impulse has resulted in significant friendships that are documented here.  But it has echoes in my early attraction to vintage cars and ancient China, not to mention England as shillings were replaced by decimals much to my sorrow.</p>
         <p>Another gay theme here is that of living in fantasy, since early on it seemed clear that the real world did not contain a place for me and my kind.  Many young gay men dream of escaping to New York one day.  Well, I was already in New York, so for me those escapes were to England or California or China, or to other eras or milieus, beginning with the Asia of Japanese prints and continuing to cathedral choirs, Fleet Street and beyond.  I soon developed the notion of being an outsider, a person alone.  On the up side, this notion has allowed me to forge my own path to an extent that most people have not.  The down side is that it has kept me alone for much of my life until now - usually solitary, sometimes lonely.  Whenever I got too comfortable in a place, it seemed, I went off alone to another side of the world to start again.  On the up side, I got to know many sides of the world intimately; on the down side, I rarely found time to enjoy the fruits of my work.  And also on the good side, but definitely with a price attached, my view of life has always been wide-screen: attempts to fit myself into cozy, inward-looking worlds (Orthodox Judaism, or the gay scene, for that matter) have never lasted long.</p>
         <p>In many ways, my return to my native place, New York, in 1991 was a statement that I wanted to stop living in fantasy and start living in reality -- which I think I have largely done.</p>
         <p>Yet another gay theme in these papers is what I call the pastoral instinct.  Anyone who does not see this as a traditional gay role need only look at the numbers of gay people in the clergy, social services, human resources and teaching (particularly special education) - or, for that matter, in the overlooked but definitely pastoral professions of hairdressing, fashion design and interior decorating.  It is true that people who do not have children of their own must improvise in finding ways to give to others.  In these archives, one can see this pastoral instinct in my gay organizing, and my work at the Gay Community Services Center in Los Angeles, with its Maoist creed of "Serve the People"; it extended into my plans to become a rabbi.  Today, I think it has found its most effective outlet, in my practice of homeopathic medicine.  "We minister one to another," has always seemed to me an obvious truth.</p>
         <p>People have often asked me why I have saved all this material, storing it and shipping it all over the world at great trouble and expense.</p>
         <p>One reason is certainly the supremely non-Buddhist impulse to hang on to time.  The archives and diaries together were, at their peak periods, an attempt to create an aide-mémoire that would enable me to re-create a period and a place in every detail.  As the years went on, I began thinking of the archives in a light that was a bit more fun, as Andy Warhol-type time capsules.  Perhaps it's my performance art.</p>
         <p>Also, as time went on and I moved from continent to continent every three years or so, these papers became in a way my only continuity.  Certain individuals were witness to certain of my stops along the road, but no one has seen the whole picture except me.  My life has been so disjointed that it was sometimes hard for me believe that all this really happened.  So the archives remain as evidence.</p>
         <p>My hope for these aides-mémoire is that they will become the basis for oral history.  I have no interest in ever writing a book, but I would love to be interviewed.  I am a good story teller, and I can promise that each piece of paper contains a good yarn.</p>
         <p>The act of sending these papers to Yale is much like sending something into orbit.  But unlike the case with rocket ships, for example, whose orbits are minutely calculated, I have not the slightest idea who, if anyone, will ever delve into this collection.  Or when: maybe in a week, a decade, a thousand years, or never.  To all researchers, I say welcome, and I hope that my highly personal style of cataloguing aids your work and does not interfere with it.  You can probably see this material more clearly than I can.  I give my blessing (if not necessarily my agreement) to any and all conclusions you may draw from these papers.  Regarding those conclusions, I am, in the words of Man Ray (who is a large figure in this archive), "unconcerned, but not indifferent."</p>
         <p>One thing I can say: every scrap of paper here has enriched me in some way.  If Abraham in the Bible could not even count the stars in the sky, how am I to count my blessings?</p>
         <p>In December 2003, the very month I had my first serious discussions about placing my papers at Yale, I came across a sentence from St. Augustine that perfectly sums up my view of these archives and the spirit in which I send them along:  "Entrust the past to God's mercy, the present to His goodness, and the future to His Providence."  These things I do.</p>
         <p>Christopher Phillips, New York, October 2005</p>
         <p>NOTES</p>
         <p>1. Diaries. In a way, this archive is just an illustration to the diaries, which have the real narrative.  So you could call these papers the biggest pop-up book in the world.</p>
         <p>My diary writing started tentatively in 1970, then picked up again in earnest in 1971.  In the early years I mostly used notebooks, and later I began using plain pieces of paper, some of them typed.  The intensity of the diary writing ranges from occasional notes when there was something on my mind to meticulous records of everything that happened during the day.  At its most extreme, it involved telephone logs in which I made notes on every conversation; some diaries look almost like scrapbooks, with various relics pasted in.  I have never had psychotherapy, and so the diaries are where I have worked things out over the years.</p>
         <p>At the moment, I have restricted the diaries until 2060.  I have done this not so much to keep secrets of my own, but to keep other people's confidences.  If a researcher particularly wants diaries from a particular period, I will try - as best I can - to prepare a text that will keep the narrative intact but will honor the trust that others have placed in me.  Another difficulty with the diaries is that they are peppered with words in various languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew and others as well, including some code words.  These would need deciphering, along with my handwriting in some places.</p>
         <p>2. A note on Hebrew letters that appear on some documents, following the Jewish custom.  In the upper right-hand corner on some file folders are Hebrew letters that stand for "Baruch Hashem," meaning "With thanks to God."  Some folders, concerning people who have died, have letters meaning, "The memory of the righteous is for a blessing."   Some documents have letters meaning, in Aramaic, "With the help of heaven."  Note, also, that the Hebrew written alphabet differs from the printed one - and that my handwriting sometimes seems to differ from both!</p>
         <p>3. I have kept most of the originals of photographs in the collection and inserted photocopies of them. I will add the originals to the collection in the future.</p>

         <p>Christopher Phillips was born on December 19, 1950, in Manhattan into an upper-middle-class assimilated Jewish family.  He attended private schools (Collegiate in New York and, briefly, Eton and Mill Hill in England) and was involved with church music as a teenager.  He graduated from Yale in 1972 (B.A., Chinese history).  He was active in the gay liberation movement beginning with the founding of the first Yale gay group in October 1969; he soon became the first publicly gay man in Yale history.  He worked full time at the Gay Community Services Center in Los Angeles in its early days (1973-75), and lived with other Center gay activists in the Highland Park Collective.  His career as an editor has included positions at <title render="italic">
               Architectural Digest
            </title> (Los Angeles, 1977-81); <title render="italic">
               Asiaweek
            </title> magazine (Hong Kong, 1981); and <title render="italic">
               The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
            </title> (London, 1982-83).  He worked for Virgin Records in Edinburgh in its early days (1972-73), where he also did gay organizing.  He lived in Taiwan as a student in 1975-76.  From 1983 to 1986, he was very involved in the Jewish Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) movement in London and in Israel, where he lived and studied at an Orthodox yeshiva.  From 1987 to 1991 he ran his own co-edition publishing house in London, and clients included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at Doubleday.  His first book was produced with Man Ray's widow, who was a close friend.  Since 1991 he has been an editor at <title render="italic">
               The New York Times
            </title>and has had a practice in homeopathic medicine in Manhattan.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- Born at French Hospital, Manhattan, on December 19, 1950, to Samuel J. Phillips (1916-73) and Nina David Phillips (née Rubinstein, 1917-80). At the time I had one brother, David F. Phillips (born September 15, 1944).</p>
               <p>-- My extended family included my maternal grandmother, Ida J. Rubinstein (1890-1962, née Sussman, born in Kovno [now Kaunas], Lithuania); my mother's unmarried brother, Roy M. Rubinstein (1912-93); and my father's unmarried sister, Louise Phillips (1912-55), a hard-partying artist who lived in a town house at 17 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, after spending much of her life in London (where my father's family had moved in about 1931, after his mother's second marriage, to a man who lived in England).</p>
               <p>-- Another key part of the family was our housekeeper and sort of second mother, Mary Fletcher (née Johnson, then Fletcher, then Lindsay; born in Virginia, 1926), who had worked with the family since 1942 and continues to be a close friend and one of my great spiritual teachers. There was also a part-time laundress and, when we moved to our brownstone and my brother and sister were born, a nanny for them and an upstairs maid.</p>
               <p>-- At the time of my birth we lived at 1136 Fifth Avenue (95th Street), Apartment 6C, Manhattan.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1952, my parents, my brother and I went to London and Paris. Though I don't remember the trip, I am told that in a London taxi, at 18 months old, I kept gesturing to where the driver's side should have been (on the left). So I guess that was the start of my small fetish for right-hand-drive cars and my taste for the novelty of foreign places.</p>
               <p>-- In 1953 (by my careful estimate, though I can't confirm the date) we started renting summer houses in Truro, Mass., on Cape Cod, eventually buying one of our own in 1959.</p>
               <p>-- In 1954-55 and 1955-56, I attended Central Presbyterian Church Nursery School, Park Avenue and 64th Street.</p>
               <p>-- On August 8, 1955, my aunt, Louise Phillips, died. After her house was sold, her English lady's maid, Gladys Martha Watt (known as Watts) came to live with us for several months in our brownstone on East 70th Street, becoming sort of my nanny; she had also taken care of me occasionally at 1136 Fifth Avenue. She was a big influence on me at the time.</p>
               <p>-- On September 24, 1955, my twin brother and sister, Adam and Victoria Phillips, were born, also at French Hospital.</p>
               <p>-- On October 3, 1955, we moved from 1136 Fifth Avenue to a brownstone at 112 East 70th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, where we grew up and where my parents continued to live until their deaths.</p>
               <p>-- In 1956, my father graduated from New York University Medical School at age 40; for many years he held the record as the oldest graduate of the school. Until about 1947, he had been a reluctant part of a family shirt business, Phillips Van Heusen (originally Phillips Jones), founded by my great-grandfather Rabbi Moses Phillips; the story of the power struggles in the company in the late 1940's are discussed in my cousin Anne Roiphe's 1999 memoir, 1185 Park Avenue.</p>
               <p>-- In September 1956, I entered Collegiate School on West 77th Street, the oldest private school in America, founded by the Dutch in New Amsterdam in 1628. My first day there I met Stephen Breimer, who remains my inseparable closest friend. I stayed at Collegiate for 12 years (with brief periods in two British boarding schools), graduating in 1968. In this series: First Grade, 1956-57; Second Grade, 1957-58; Third Grade, 1958-59.</p>
               <p>-- Summers of 1957, 1958, 1959, when my father was a medical intern and/or resident, we rented houses in Westchester County, New York. In 1958 and 1959 I attended Mohawk Day Camp there.</p>
               <p>-- In 1958, I began piano lessons with Mrs. Elinor Graydon Woodbridge, who lived at 11 East 71st Street. I studied the piano through high school, though I concentrated more on the organ after 1965.</p>
               <p>-- In around 1958, Ólöf Einarsdottir (later Haggerty) started as a nanny for my brother and sister. She was from Iceland, and was the first person I had ever known who spoke a foreign language. Iceland joined my list of fascinating places.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1959, my parents bought our country house with, I believe, about 30 acres, on North Pamet Road, Truro, Mass. This property soon became part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. We sold it in the mid-1980's.</p>
               <p>-- In about 1959, I saw part of a television program in which Leonard Bernstein visited the St. Paul's Cathedral choir in London. This started my obsession with choirs, and it was confirmed in November 1963, when I finally found a cathedral-type choir in New York at St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Postwar life on the Upper East Side life among assimilated Jews who had some money but never called themselves rich. My parents placed more value on intelligence, friendships and social justice, and downplayed glamour; they read <title render="italic">
                     The Herald Tribune
                  </title> before <title render="italic">
                     The New York Times
                  </title>. (The early, 1940's scenes of the movie 84 Charing Cross Roadwere set on a side street very near 1136 Fifth Avenue and capture the atmosphere of that milieu perfectly.)</p>
               <p>-- The development of a young gay boy who felt he had to be "The Best Little Boy in the World." Along with this came a feeling of special closeness to people of my parents' and grandparents' generation, an instinct described in Will Fellows's 2004 book, <title render="italic">
                     A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture
                  </title>.</p>
               <p>-- My constant dreams and schemes of faraway places began in earliest childhood. If many gay boys in Iowa dream of escaping to New York – well, I was already in New York. So I dreamed of cars, England, Scotland, Japan, China, and past eras, like the 1920's.</p>
               <p>-- My obsession with cars and car brochures, which extended until 1964, when my obsession duly progressed to boys!</p>
               <p>-- Early creative projects, like my first book, the "Hell Book" in Second Grade; my discovery of the typewriter, in this case my parents' 1952 I.B.M. electric with proportional spacing. My habit of making creative projects with words and paper has extended to this day, to include my years as a book publisher in England and the making of this archive and catalogue.</p>
               <p>-- Central Presbyterian Church Nursery School and the early concepts of God I developed there, which have not changed much to this day.</p>
               <p>-- Collegiate School, academics and activities. The files contain much school work, the school newspaper and yearbooks.</p>
               <p>-- Mohawk Day Camp, in Westchester County, New York, which is still in existence.</p>
               <p>-- The changing Upper East Side streetscape, as recorded in four 1959 photographs (photocopies) by my father. Three are of Third Avenue, which was being developed after the elevated train tracks were torn down; one is of Park Avenue, whose mansions were being torn down for apartment houses.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- The rest of my school years, until the beginning of college in September 1968. The grades were as follows: Fourth Grade, 1959-60; Fifth, 1960-61; Sixth, 1961-62; Seventh, 1962-63; Eighth, 1963-64; Ninth, 1964-65; Tenth, 1965-66; Eleventh, 1966-67; Twelfth, 1967-68.</p>
               <p>-- Summers 1960, 1961 and 1962, I went away to Great Oaks Camp in Oxford, Maine, run by Joseph F. Becker, a teacher at Collegiate, and his son-in-law, Richard Dryzga, a teacher at St. David's School in New York. The camp drew on boys from those schools and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1961, my parents bought a Jeep in Cape Cod, which meant I was finally able to drive from the driver's seat, starting on the beach. I had had driving lessons sitting next to my father since I was about 5.</p>
               <p>-- December 23, 1962, my grandmother Ida J. Rubinstein, the person I was closest to in the world, died.</p>
               <p>-- In 1963, I met and started studying with the concert pianist Constance Keene, who remains a close friend and big influence on me. In addition to music, I learned from her a standard of excellence that I hold to this day. She had been a friend of my family's since the 1940s, and by coincidence lived at that time on the same floor as my friend Stephen Breimer at 19 East 88th Street.</p>
               <p>-- On November 3, 1963, I discovered the Choir of St. Thomas Church at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue; it was a cathedral-type choir in the English tradition. I immediately became an obsessed groupie of the St. Thomas Choir School.</p>
               <p>-- On February 1, 1964, I had my bar mitzvah at Central Synagogue, Lexington Avenue and 55th Street. The party was originally planned for our house, but the guest list grew too big and we held it at the Plaza Hotel, where my parents' wedding had taken place.</p>
               <p>-- Summers 1964 and 1965, I went to Camp Monomoy, in East Brewster, Cape Cod, Mass. Monomoy was part of Cape Cod Sea Camps Inc., which included Camp Wono for girls.</p>
               <p>-- June-July 1965, I attended Mill Hill School in London, which my father had gone to (and hated) in the early 1930s, when his mother moved the family to England after her second marriage. It was there that I developed my passion for stiff separate shirt collars. Being in England was every bit as thrilling as I thought it would be, and more. At this point, my England obsession really took over.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1965 at Mill Hill, I began playing the organ and got friendly with the choir verger St. Paul's Cathedral, which was my choir-groupie heaven. I worked as a professional organist until about my sophomore Year at Yale.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1965 in England also saw the start of three important relationships: with Miss Rose Mary Braithwaite (born London, 1914); my Frankfurt-born cousin on my father's side, Margot Hoare (1917-1982, a barrister, née Blaut, then Temple, then Hoare), and her husband, Malcolm V. Hoare (1912-1991, part of the Hoare banking family). The Hoares were two of the people I loved and looked up to most in the world. There is much correspondence from all three of these people in the archive.</p>
               <p>-- In July 1965, I passed by Eton College, the boarding school, on a bus on my way to Windsor Castle. I saw the boys in their tailcoats and decided I had to go there somehow.</p>
               <p>-- On January 25, 1966, I learned one of my great life lessons when my father wrote a letter to the headmaster of Eton asking if I could go there for a term. In response to my desperate desire to go the school, my parents took this position: Everyone knows how hard it is to get in to Eton, but if you have a dream, it is worth the price of a stamp. This approach has made everything possible in my life.</p>
               <p>-- April-July 1966, I attended Eton. This experience changed me profoundly, making me much more outgoing, and confirmed my belief that realizing a dream can be just as wonderful as one imagined it.</p>
               <p>-- In about 1966, I began playing lecture-recitals on the piano in schools.</p>
               <p>-- July-August 1967, I went to Britain and Ireland with my parents and my parents' friend Miss T. Margaret Jamer (1901-98, known as Jimmie Jamer), who became an important fixture in our lives in the early 1960's. On that visit, I played a lecture-recital at the King's College Choir School in Cambridge, and visited the organist and conductor David [later Sir David] Willcocks at King's as part of a campaign to go to college there as an organ scholar.</p>
               <p>-- Christmas Eve, 1967, my father had his first heart attack. It was the first of several, in the days when there was no proper treatment for heart conditions. From that time until his death, in 1973, the family was to a certain extent on tenterhooks; it also meant that he and my mother, accompanied by their friend T. Margaret Jamer (known as Jimmie Jamer), began traveling to warm places for part of the winter.</p>
               <p>-- June 5, 1968, I graduated from Collegiate. That morning we woke up to the news that Robert F. Kennedy had been shot.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1968, I spent in New York, where Keith Edmondson, a friend from Mill Hill School, came to visit.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- New York private school life and education, especially Collegiate School. Files contain much school work and ephemera, including the school newspaper (one 1959 issue has a long article about a "teaching machine" computer then being tested) and yearbooks.</p>
               <p>-- Summer camps, especially Great Oaks Camp in Oxford, Maine, and Camp Monomoy in East Brewster, Cape Cod, Mass.</p>
               <p>-- An American's experience at British boarding schools, especially Eton, for which there is more than a full carton of material, including letters and ephemera.</p>
               <p>-- Many letters to and from Hugo Vickers, now the celebrated biographer of Cecil Beaton and others, who was one of my closest friends at Eton; letters from him continue for the rest of the archive.</p>
               <p>-- Reform Judaism of the 1960's, including some Sunday school material. How an adolescent developed a religious sense and practice in the absence of any spiritual guidance or serious Jewish education from Central Synagogue. To everyone's slight shock, I kept many Orthodox laws on my own, figuring them out on my own. A big, but unostentatious bar mitzvah at the Plaza Hotel. The early Jewish experiences of a future Baal Tshuvah [Newly Orthodox Jew] -- a theme that picks up again in Series VIII and reaches its height in Series IX and Series XII.</p>
               <p>-- St. Thomas Church and St. Thomas Choir School: leaflets, programs and other ephemera.</p>
               <p>-- The world of church music, choirs and choir schools in England and the United States.</p>
               <p>-- Programs for special services at St. Paul's Cathedral, including Churchill's procession and funeral, and correspondence with the choir verger.</p>
               <p>-- Frank Colapinto (1898-?), a musical visionary and poet, who made a meager living as a music copyist and was known as a kind of gadfly on the edges of the New York classical music scene in the 1960's and probably before; we met in the front row at St. Thomas's. There are many letters from him, poems and examples of his musical scores.</p>
               <p>-- Continuing fascination with England, which continued after Eton with schemes to attend King's College, Cambridge.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files: (1) commemorating the novel <title render="italic">
                     Les Amitiés Particulières,
                  </title> by Roger Peyrefitte.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's fantasies of being "somewhere else"; for me, these were the beginning of a lifelong tendency toward making worldwide dreams and schemes. While most dream of going to New York some day, I was already in New York -- so I focused on Episcopal churches and England (both had choirs, boarding schools and great uniforms), China and Japan; cars were part of this fantasy life until about 1964, when my tastes changed and the cars themselves became less interesting. Letters and collections show how a teenager branched out and formed worldwide connections in the days before e-mail, the Internet or easy trans-Atlantic telephone calls. With the discovery of St. Thomas, I began making a private life for myself away from my home, and established a habit of secretiveness.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's fascination with uniforms (church vestments, Eton tails, stiff separate collars), cathedrals, religious rituals, old people, old cars and the Old World. This phenomenon is the thesis of the book <title render="italic">
                     A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture,
                  </title> by Will Fellows (2004).</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's spiritual life, with a lot of ritual. For several years I would go to Central Synagogue Friday night and Saturday morning, then St. Thomas's twice on Sunday.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's intense friendships with people one or two generations older. These were definitely not encouraged by my parents, nor was my love of formality and glamour.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's isolation in the era before there was any openly available information about gay life, community or meeting places. The struggles of someone who wanted that underground life but could not find it.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's overall sense of inhibition. While I was fascinated by beatniks and the emerging world of Bob Dylan and the 60's, I felt unable to take part. Instead of <title render="italic">
                     The Catcher in the Rye,
                  </title> I read things like Emily Post, Jinx Faulkenburg's autobiography, and a history of the Waldorf-Astoria: that, in a way, says it all.</p>
               <p>-- A gay teenager's emotional inhibition, symbolized not just by stiff separate collars, but also by a love of England, a place where emotions are traditionally downplayed.</p>
               <p>-- How "The Best Little Boy in the World" invented himself as a popular figure in school and, despite a stutter and poor grades, traded on charm and eccentricity with such success that the Yale dean of admissions accepted me during my interview.</p>
               <p>-- Early handmade books by someone who grew up to become a book publisher.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATE AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1968, I entered Yale as an undergraduate. My years were as follows: Freshman, 1968-69; Sophomore, 1969-70; Junior, 1970-71; Senior, 1971-72. I majored first in Chinese Studies, then Japanese Studies, then finally History, with a Senior thesis on Chinese history under the direction of Professor Arthur F. Wright.</p>
               <p>-- December 1968, when I turned 18, I was given access to my legacy of $5,000 from my aunt, Louise Phillips (1912-55). This money started me on the road to independence, allowing me to buy a car and travel.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1969, I attended Stanford Summer School for introductory Chinese. It was my first experience in California, and it was a magical time. That summer I was still wearing a tie, jacket and flannel trousers to class every day; but California gave me an inkling that there was more to the world than stiff collars and the extreme formality I gravitated toward in New York and England. I taught at Donaldina Cameron House in San Francisco Chinatown in the afternoons and spent hours exploring the city. I drove across country with an Eton friend, Henry Karsten, in my brand-new 1969 Peugeot, named Lydia; on the trip back I was accompanied by my close Yale friend Paul Goldberger.</p>
               <p>-- June 22, 1969, saw one of the campest single moments of my life. That Sunday I entered San Francisco for the first time, and exactly as I was crossing the Golden Gate Bridge the news came over the car radio that Judy Garland had died. This, of course, started the lead-up to the Stonewall Riots the following Friday, the event that saved my life.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1969 at Stanford, for the first time, I told someone I was gay.</p>
               <p>-- October 30, 1969, I attended the first meeting of the first gay group at Yale, called the Homosexuality Discussion Group. This was the first time I was able to find other gay people who seemed "normal, just like me." I came out immediately: I was soon the chairman of the group and the only one who was totally out in public. The Homosexuality Discussion Group was later renamed the Gay Alliance at Yale.</p>
               <p>-- March 1970, I visited London, and started keeping a journal for the first time.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1970, in the lead-up to the giant Panther rally on the New Haven Green, a man named Guy Nassberg appeared on the Yale campus and radicalized our student gay group -- and especially me -- almost overnight. He was one the world's great catalysts: no one was ever quite the same after meeting him. We now felt ourselves part of a revolutionary Gay Liberation Movement. [Gay researchers, note! Guy Nassberg is an important figure and deserves study.]</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1970, I went to Stanford Summer School again, this time for introductory Japanese, and again worked in Chinatown, both as an English teacher at Donaldina Cameron House and as an organist at the Presbyterian Church in Chinatown. I was slowly starting to loosen up.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1970, I met Joyce Block (1926-90) at Stanford summer school. She was a teacher, calligrapher and artist living in Japan and she figures importantly in the archive until her death in September 1990, and thereafter, since I was her executor.</p>
               <p>-- September 1970, I became the first on-the-record openly gay person in the history of Yale by signing a letter about the Homosexuality Discussion Group that was placed under every door on the Yale campus. I wrote the letter, and it was my idea, inspired by the central problem of my earlier life: being ready and eager to come out but being prevented from doing so by the total absence of public information about where gay people could be found.</p>
               <p>-- On February 15, 1970, Britain switched to decimal currency from pounds, shillings and pence. This started my disillusionment with England, and was the start of the end of the England of my dreams. See also the files named "England Obsession" in Series II, and "The England I Always Longed for but Never Found" in Series XI.</p>
               <p>-- March 1971, I visited London and Paris (my first trip to Paris since I was 18 months old) with Paul Goldberger and two other Yale friends.</p>
               <p>-- Winter-spring-summer 1971, I was making plans to spend the 1971-72 year studying and teaching in Japan with the help of Joyce Block in Yokohama, a plan that fell through because of visa problems.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1971, I spent with my brother David F. Phillips in San Francisco waiting for my Japanese visa. This was also the summer of my first happy love affair, with Peter Alpert (1951-91), who was at Berkeley Summer School.</p>
               <p>-- 1971-72, my diary-keeping began in earnest.</p>
               <p>-- June 1972, I graduated from Yale, with a B.A. in History.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- This period marked the start of the long "loosening-up" process that still continues today, when I am in my 50's. I started this series wearing a jacket and tie every day, even to class, even in California summers. I ended the series as a radically gay long-haired hippie with a taste for marijuana and LSD. While the external parts of this loosening up were fun and easy, the internal parts took decades more to accomplish.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files (15) touch on Yale (and other colleges, including Trinity, Bard and Southern Connecticut State), East and West Coasts, London and Paris.</p>
               <p>-- Gay: some correspondence with members of Yale's gay group after they graduated, especially one who was living in the Middle East.</p>
               <p>-- <title render="italic">
                     Yale Daily News:
                  </title> microfiche of every mention of homosexuality and article of gay interest, fall 1969 to spring 1972.</p>
               <p>-- Campus life at Yale, 1968-1972.</p>
               <p>-- East Asian Studies as it was being taught at Yale during this period.</p>
               <p>-- Asian-American: social services and conditions in San Francisco Chinatown and a little from New York. Correspondence and other material from Donaldina Cameron House in Chinatown San Francisco.</p>
               <p>-- Asian-American: the early days of Asian-American Studies programs at Yale and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>-- Vietnam War: a little bit of anti-war material produced by East Asian scholars' groups.</p>
               <p>-- Vietnam War: my application for Conscientious Objector draft status, which gives a good idea of my religious thinking at the time.</p>
               <p>-- Eton: continuing correspondence with friends, especially Hugo Vickers, that includes information about developments there.</p>
               <p>-- London counterculture, 1970-1971, in an ephemeral paperback book, <title render="italic">
                     Alternative London
                  </title> (1970).</p>
               <p>-- Organ, church music and choir schools, including St. Thomas Church in New York and others in England. Includes personal notes on performances. My interest in church music seemed to evaporate when I came out.</p>
               <p>-- Continuing schemes to travel all over the world and to do things in the most international and complicated way possible.</p>
               <p>-- Continued contacts with Cambridge University, but the goal changed from studying organ to studying Chinese there. Like my interest in organ music, my fascination with England started to wane as I loosened up, and my "ideal place" shifted to California.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) My address book for much of this period was started in 1966 at Eton and can be found with that material in Series II.</p>
               <p>2) Most coursework and other academic material, especially relating to Professors Arthur F. Wright and Mary Clabaugh Wright, can be found in the Series IV.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- June 1972, I graduated from Yale.</p>
               <p>-- June-August 1972, I worked as private secretary to Benjamin Sonnenberg (1901-78), a figure of legend in New York and one of the inventors of modern public relations, in his two adjoining mansions on Gramercy Park. It was my first 9-to-5 job.</p>
               <p>-- September 3, 1972, I went to Paris to seek my fortune, which I did not find there.</p>
               <p>-- October 1972, on a visit to London, I found a job with Virgin Records, which was then a very young company expanding extremely rapidly; my immediate boss was Nik Powell, Richard Branson's second in command (and today a famous movie producer). They sent me to Edinburgh to find premises for a shop and then renovate, open and run it. I worked for Virgin in London for a few weeks, then moved to Edinburgh on November 6, 1972, staying there until May 1973.</p>
               <p>-- December 19, 1972, my 22nd birthday, "my" Virgin Records shop opened at 61 Thistle Street, in the 18th-century New Town district of Edinburgh. I found a furnished flat in the same building two floors up in the front; it was my first apartment.</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1973 to spring 1973, while living in Edinburgh, I was active in gay liberation organizing.</p>
               <p>-- March 7-10, 1973, my parents and their friend T. Margaret Jamer (1901-98, known as Jimmie Jamer) visited me in Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>-- March 28, 1973, my father died.</p>
               <p>-- In spring of 1973, I was making future plans for graduate school in economics and "Pacific urban planning" at the University of Hawaii, to begin in the fall of 1974. Before I could apply, I needed summer courses in economics, and since Edinburgh was freezing cold, I chose the University of California at Los Angeles. To sit out the year between my application and the start of school, I sought and found teaching jobs at British "prep" schools (boarding schools for boys 9-12).</p>
               <p>-- May 1973, I left Edinburgh for Los Angeles and UCLA. I soon became involved with the Gay Community Services Center and stayed in Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES</p>
               <p>-- Benjamin Sonnenberg (1901-78), the famous New York public relations man, legendary host, and New York's self-invented "last Edwardian." Includes some details of life in his two adjoining mansions on Gramercy Park, photographs (photocopies) of the houses, and the two Sotheby's catalogues from his estate sale.</p>
               <p>-- Virgin Records, then a very young company, during its period of very rapid expansion, 1972-73. The establishment of Virgin Records, Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>-- Gay organizing in Edinburgh and gay life there.</p>
               <p>-- Some stray bits of gay information from New York, Paris and London.</p>
               <p>-- Examples of how gay people copied down names, contact information and other resources in the days when this information was hard to find, before the Internet or readily available gay guides or periodicals.</p>
               <p>-- A young man's search for a place in the world, first in Paris, then London and finally Edinburgh. I was loosening up more in this period, a shift symbolized by my return to Britain, not as a church musician, but as part of – though an ill-fitting part of – the hip counterculture as symbolized by Virgin Records.</p>
               <p>-- Learning in Edinburgh an important lesson about my far-flung schemes: one can assemble the perfect job and perfect apartment in the perfect city, and those do not necessarily add up to a happy life.</p>
               <p>-- More of my tendency to think big and wide-screen: I was sitting in Edinburgh making plans for Los Angeles and Honolulu.</p>
               <p>-- Running before I could walk. Though I told Virgin Records I knew nothing about rock music or running a shop, they plunged me in at the top. This is a continuing theme in these papers: I started my journalism career as managing editor of a magazine (Taiwan 1975-76 Series) and started my book publishing house without any experience in the field (Israel 1984-87 and London 1987-91 Series).</p>
               <p>-- The last gasp of my interest in British boarding schools. This time they were not a fascination but a means to sit out the year while I applied to graduate school. At this time I had my last contacts with Anthony Chenevix-Trench, who had moved from being headmaster of Eton to Fettes College in Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>-- The workings of the Gabbitas-Thring Services of Sackville Street, Mayfair, London, famous for placing those at a loose end in jobs in private schools throughout Britain and the world. I had the feeling that this place was every well-bred young man's greatest comfort and greatest fear.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files (7).</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) In this series I have grouped together all material relating to Benjamin Sonnenberg, Virgin Records and gay life in Edinburgh, even if that meant some lapses in chronology.</p>
               <p>2) For the address book I used during this period, see June 1971.</p>
               <p>3) One carton of my archives from this period got lost in transit from Edinburgh to Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>4) Most dates follow British usage (day/month/year), though I went back and forth between British and American systems in my personal writings.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- May 1973, I left Edinburgh for New York, where I picked up my car in storage and drove to Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>-- June 1973, I arrived in Los Angeles for summer school in economics at the University of California at Los Angeles; it was my first time in Southern California, and I lived in the dorms.</p>
               <p>-- On June 21, 1973, I went to volunteer at the Gay Community Services Center, then in its first home, in three wooden Victorian houses at 1614 Wilshire Boulevard, at Union Street, just east of MacArthur Park.</p>
               <p>-- Late summer 1973 until August 1974, I worked full time as a "core staff member" of the Gay Community Services Center; most of my work was in the Self Development Program, doing counseling, leading groups and staffing the 24-hour telephone hotline.</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1973, a group of center workers got together to form the Highland Park Collective (in the Highland Park neighborhood, between downtown and Pasadena), which lasted until about 1977, although by then the residents were no longer connected with the center. This collective soon attained near-mythic status in gay Los Angeles history. We moved in on October 1, 1973.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1974, Ed Sanders arrived from Alabama to work at the Gay Community Services Center. We became a couple, and it was the first time I had actually made a complete life with someone. He moved in with me at the Highland Park Collective.</p>
               <p>-- Early summer 1974, I took a wonderful Chinese language class at open-enrollment Los Angeles City College, with Professor Tung Cheng, an inspiring and elegant man with beautiful Chinese handwriting. He got me back on the Chinese trail.</p>
               <p>-- August-December 1974, Ed Sanders and I went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he was finishing up his Master of Social Work degree at the University of Alabama. I worked as a laborer on the paint crew at Bryce Hospital, the famous ante-bellum state mental hospital in Tuscaloosa. During this time I began making serious plans to continue with East Asian Studies, and these included an idea to go to Asia with Eddy accompanying me in a teaching job.</p>
               <p>-- January-August 1975, Ed Sanders and I were back in Los Angeles. We lived at first in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, moving back to the Highland Park Collective in the summer. During this period Eddy was very involved with the center. I worked there a little, but was mostly studying Chinese and making plans to go to Asia, and actually at something of a loose end. I also took my one and only journalism class, at Los Angeles City College, on news writing, which formed the basis of my whole subsequent career. Also during this period I did some interviews and research in Asian-American Studies, specifically, Japanese-American relocation during World War II. This was a toe in the water in terms of journalism.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1975, the Gay Community Services Center moved from 1614 Wilshire Boulevard to larger quarters at 1213 North Highland Avenue in Hollywood. As the center grew and started to get more grant funding for its programs, there was discontent within radical sectors of the gay community, including current and former center workers. The result was a "strike" against the center that reached the brink of violence and caused a split within the gay community that continues to be devastating to many people even decades later. (Gay researchers note: this incident is highly important.)</p>
               <p>-- Spring-summer 1975, I worked in a county-funded study at the center called the Alcoholism Needs Assessment project, which investigated whether the primacy of bars in the gay community had led to a strikingly high level of alcohol consumption among gay men. I consider this to be my first editing job.</p>
               <p>-- On August 13, 1975, I left for Taiwan.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Gay: most files relate to gay life, except for the ones labeled Asian-American.</p>
               <p>-- Life in Los Angeles, 1973-75.</p>
               <p>-- Gay life in Los Angeles, 1973-75.</p>
               <p>-- Gay life in New York.</p>
               <p>-- Gay life in isolated parts of the country, as shown in letters written to the center in the days before the Internet.</p>
               <p>-- Gay Community Services Center in its early days -- a great deal of material about the institution, its programs, services and people, who included Don Kilhefner, Morris Kight, Dr. Betty Berzon, Rand Schrader and Sheldon Andelson.</p>
               <p>-- Highland Park Collective, 1973-75, a gay collective made up of center workers. The collective included two people who figure prominently in later series in the archive, Jerome Gold (then known as Crickett Bon Bon) and Jeff B. Richards.</p>
               <p>-- Very brief notes on two other important gay collectives in Los Angeles: the Hoover Street Collective, which was a precursor of Highland Park and home to some of the center's founders; and the Echo Park Collective, whose residents were not involved with the center, and was concurrent with Highland Park.</p>
               <p>-- Documentation that the 12-step group called Sexual Compulsives Anonymous existed in Los Angeles as early as 1973.</p>
               <p>-- Gay history-writing of the early 1970's.</p>
               <p>-- Gay and feminist bibliographies of the early 1970's.</p>
               <p>-- Life in Alabama, 1974.</p>
               <p>-- Bryce Hospital, Tuscaloosa, Alabama: some material about mental health and personnel policies at this state mental hospital.</p>
               <p>-- East Asian Studies, including course offerings in the United States and some foreign countries.</p>
               <p>-- Asian-American Studies programs in the early days of the field.</p>
               <p>-- Asian-American community resources in Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>-- Asian-American Studies, Japanese-American relocation during World War II: interviews and research.</p>
               <p>-- My loosening-up process became pretty much complete, to the extent that I used another name, Morning Glory.</p>
               <p>-- My first complete relationship, in which I really made a life with someone.</p>
               <p>-- Even in the middle of Alabama, I continued to dream and scheme on a worldwide scale, this time returning to my interest in Asia.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) I have grouped together all files concerning the Gay Community Services Center, the Highland Park Collective and Asian-American Studies, even if this makes for a small lapse in chronology.</p>
               <p>2) A note on names: For much of this period I used a gay liberation "nom de guerre," Morning Glory -- no first or last name, just Morning Glory. So letters and notes to me are often addressed using that name, or M.G. for short. I also appear on some lists that way, especially at the Gay Community Services Center. I was not the only one in the gay liberation movement of that era to take this kind of alternative name as a means of self-invention.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- From August 15, 1975, to August 17, 1976, I lived in Taipei, Taiwan, where I studied Chinese, taught English, had a great group of close friends, got my first job in magazines, acted as an occasional extra in Shaw Brothers movies, sang with a blue-grass band a couple of times, did fun drugs, explored gay life, had an important relationship with a man there, and generally enjoyed wild bohemian Christopher Isherwood-type student days. Our large communal apartment on Tung An Street in Taipei became sort of like a collective, and was the scene of a lot of great parties.</p>
               <p>-- August 29, 1975, my brother David F. Phillips arrived in Taiwan to take a teaching job in the town of Taichung. He stayed until the spring and was a frequent visitor to Tung An Street.</p>
               <p>-- September 21, 1975, I met Vincent (born Taiwan, 1955), with whom I had a very important relationship, which lasted until spring.</p>
               <p>-- In November 1975, my mother visited me in Taiwan and with her I made my first visit to Hong Kong and, after she left, Macao. This was more the Asia I was hoping to find (with an old-fashioned British touches as a bonus), and I decided I wanted to return there some day to work as a journalist. (See Series IX.)</p>
               <p>-- Early April 1976, I got my first magazine job, as Managing Editor in charge of <title render="italic">
                     Taiwan Trade Monthly,
                  </title> with a brief to remake the magazine from scratch. I had never been in a magazine office before, but I immediately knew this was what I had always wanted at do. I realized that this was my route to joining the big world. It had glamour and an outlet for my imagination and love of making big plans. I enlisted my friends as reporters, and it was the start of my publishing career.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1976, I was accepted by Louisiana State University into its Master of Social Work program; my aim was to become qualified as a therapist, essentially in a continuation of my work at the Gay Community Services Center. I was also offered a scholarship and a teaching assistantship at LSU, which would have been the cushion I needed to make my re-entry into the United States, where I had no money and no place to live. But I must have had a sense that this goal had become outdated, because the desire to travel was stronger than the desire to head to Baton Rouge in August to start classes.</p>
               <p>-- On August 17, 1976, I left Taiwan to go traveling, part of the time with one or two of my Taipei housemates, part of the time alone. This trip took me to Hong Kong, Thailand, Bali (Kuta Beach, before the first large hotel was built), Singapore, Malaysia (where we hitchhiked and I experienced a Chinese opium den in a small village), Korea and Japan (where I stayed with Joyce Block).</p>
               <p>-- While traveling, I heard from my brother David F. Phillips, who was by this time living in San Francisco, that I could collect unemployment insurance from my pre-Taiwan work if I filed my claim by October 31. This was the re-entry money I needed: I cut my trip short and headed back to Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>-- On October 22, 1976, I returned to Los Angeles.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Students in the 1970's during their <title render="italic">
                     Wanderjahr.
                  </title> As it did for Christopher Isherwood, this included odd jobs teaching English, in my case with families, at small institutes, a high school, and the diplomatic training college of the moribund Nationalist Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (which had, nonetheless, a great cafeteria).</p>
               <p>-- Life in Taiwan, 1975-76, just after the death of Chiang Kai-shek, when it was still more or less under military rule.</p>
               <p>-- Finally getting to Asia, with a certain amount of disappointment because gray-concrete, motorcycle-filled Taipei was not the traditional China of my dreams.</p>
               <p>-- Gay life in Taiwan and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>-- The 1976 Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco as described by my brother David F. Phillips, who saw it from his Polk Street window.</p>
               <p>-- The Southeast Asia backpackers route in the 1970's -- when the first Lonely Planet guide, <title render="italic">
                     Southeast Asia on a Shoestring,
                  </title> was still circulating quasi-underground and before Kuta Beach, Bali, had even one big hotel.</p>
               <p>-- Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective: many letters from this period discuss ongoing developments in both places, and I have marked them accordingly.</p>
               <p>-- Social work graduate programs in the United States, Canada and Hong Kong, with which I was in touch by mail.</p>
               <p>-- My ongoing relationship with Ed Sanders, much of which was worked out in our correspondence; this correspondence also has a lot of material about the Gay Community Services Center and the Highland Park Collective.</p>
               <p>-- Starting my career in publishing as managing editor of a magazine-- another example of my running before I could walk.Â  But in this case, being a magazine editor was a natural talent and an outlet for my love of creating big plans and schemes, so I did it pretty well.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Names: Many letters from Los Angeles address me by my gay liberation "nom de guerre," Morning Glory, or M.G. for short.  Documents in Chinese use my Chinese name, FEI Hai-ch'ing.</p>
               <p>2) Dates often follow the Taiwan system of counting years from the establishment of the Republic of China, with 1911 being Year 1. So 1975 was Year 64 and 1976 was Year 65. The Chinese put the month before the day. Therefore, 65.4.3 means April 3, 1976.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- October 22, 1976, I arrived back in Los Angeles with no job, almost no money, but the promise of unemployment insurance if I filed my claim by October 31. After a few days at the much-changed Highland Park Collective, I moved in with my friend Stephen Breimer, who had an apartment in Beverly Hills.</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1976, I lived in Beverly Hills, enjoying life without any pressure (and also, in retrospect, enjoying the slow, almost contemplative pace of being in Los Angeles without a car).</p>
               <p>-- Christmas 1976, my mother visited me in Los Angeles. She, Stephen Breimer and a family friend JoAnne Stang (the mother of David Stang, a close Camp Monomoy friend) persuaded me that I was qualified to set my sites high in the professional world.</p>
               <p>-- January 27, 1977, I moved into a small "guest house" garden apartment in the Hollywood Hills and looked for jobs, first in show business public relations, and then in magazines. I got a list of every magazine published in Los Angeles and began calling them one by one, armed with my Managing Editor's title from <title render="italic">
                     Taiwan Trade Monthly
                  </title>. One of the magazines on the list was <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title>, which I had never heard of. However, they were on the list, so I called them and was miraculously put straight through to the famous Editor-in-Chief, Paige Rense.</p>
               <p>-- April 11, 1977, I started working at <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title>. I was in heaven at that elegant, world-class place. The white heat of my professional ambition and all my worldwide schemes finally had an arena. I worked there from April 1977 until May 1981. At first I was a freelancer writing captions for the company's first book project, then shifted to the magazine, where I began the Architecture Feature, and was also at various times the editor in charge of the Historic Homes, Gardens and Historic Architecture features; eventually, I added some editorial administrative responsibilities. I also did some feature writing for the magazine.</p>
               <p>-- At some point in 1977 (or 1978), Stephen Breimer and I traded apartments for several months: he moved to my little guest house in the Hollywood Hills and I moved back to Beverly Hills.</p>
               <p>-- On July 23, 1977, I met Jim Ito (born Los Angeles, 1948). It was love at first sight. We lived together until my move to Hong Kong in June 1981.</p>
               <p>-- August 1977, Paige Rense, the Editor-in-Chief of <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title>, asked me to start a new residential Architectural Feature for the magazine. Since I knew nothing about the subject, the architect Frank Israel (1945-96) advised me initially. Eventually, my close friend from Yale, Paul Goldberger, who was then the architecture critic of <title render="italic">
                     The New York Times
                  </title>, wrote some of the articles.</p>
               <p>-- February 1978, I was given the title Associate Editor.</p>
               <p>-- May 1978, I visited Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
               <p>-- December 1978, I began work on my first book, <title render="italic">
                     The Dream Come True: Great Houses of Los Angeles
                  </title>, produced by John Calmann, a British book "packager" (and protégé of Benjamin Sonnenberg), who was an important figure in my life until his death, in 1980. Text was by Brendan Gill (who had also been extremely close to Ben Sonnenberg and who had been an important figure in my life since I read his memoir Here at <title render="italic">
                     The New Yorker
                  </title> on the road in Southeast Asia in 1976), and he became a good friend until his death, in 1997). Photographs were by the British photographer Derry Moore (then Viscount Moore, now Earl of Drogheda). I chose the houses, got us access to them, and organized the project in Los Angeles, all of which exposed me to celebrities, local experts, and the city's "high society." I also started giving parties, with the help of a gay couple Roman A. Clef and Michael Leopold, an artist and art critic respectively, who were Los Angeles social gadflies. The bulk of the work on the book took place in 1979 and 1980.</p>
               <p>-- April 1979, I was given the title Associate Managing Editor, which included a lot of the administrative part of the Managing Editor's job.</p>
               <p>-- November and December 1979, I took a trip to Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
               <p>-- July 19, 1980, my mother died.</p>
               <p>-- By fall 1980, I was restless at <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title> and presented a proposal to <title render="italic">
                     The Los Angeles Times
                  </title> to start a Sunday color magazine there.</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1980, I began contacting magazines in London looking for a job.</p>
               <p>-- January 1981, I made a three-day visit to London for an interview at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> on Fleet Street. It was a secret trip over a long weekend, which added to the fun. I desperately wanted a job there.</p>
               <p>-- March 1981, I set off on a trip to Hong Kong and Tokyo to look for magazine or newspaper jobs. I was offered a job at <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek
                  </title>, a weekly news magazine in Hong Kong, almost immediately, so never went to Tokyo; instead, I darted directly to New York for the second week of the trip to attend to my mother's estate.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1981, I was trying to get <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph
                  </title> in London to make me an offer: I had a bird in the hand in Hong Kong, but I preferred Fleet Street. No offer came in time.</p>
               <p>-- May 20, 1981, was my last day at <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- June 16, 1981, I left Los Angeles for Hong Kong. I remained overseas for 10 years, until February 13, 1991, the end of the first installment of this archive.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Life in Los Angeles as the disco era of the 70's gave way to the glossy Reagan boom of the 1980's.</p>
               <p>-- Architectural Digestmagazine and my work there.</p>
               <p>-- The beginnings of word processing and fax technology in the magazine industry.</p>

               <p>-- An autobiographical dossier prepared by Diane Abramson, a Los Angeles celebrity hostess (and possessor of 12 ovens), one of the residents in The Dream Come True.</p>
               <p>-- The gay artist Roman A. Clef and his partner, the critic and social gadfly Michael Leopold (both born 1929). (Gay researchers, note! Theirs is a great story.)</p>
               <p>-- Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective: activities of Jerome Gold (formerly Crickett Bon Bon) in forming an art gallery with Michael Leopold.</p>
               <p>-- Truly making a happy life with someone for the first time. Jim Ito and I lived in (and bought) the house in Hollywood where the "My sister/My mother" scene in the movie Chinatown was filmed.</p>
               <p>-- Several cassettes of readings and classes with psychics in Los Angeles and New York. Also, a numerology reading by Matthew Oliver Goodwin and an astrological reading.</p>
               <p>-- Gay life in Los Angeles, London and New York: three thin files.</p>

               <p>-- My mother's death, and my adjustment to being without parents.</p>
               <p>-- The opening up of the range of possibilities when I realized I was inheriting enough money to provide a small financial cushion (which, in those days of 15% interest rates, seemed like more than it was).</p>
               <p>-- During this period, I read Golda Meir's autobiography,<title render="italic">
                     My Life
                  </title>, and that book gave me a sense of Jewish identity for the first time ever. Beginning in 1979, I became very active in Sinai Temple, a Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles. It was my first serious plunge into Judaism as a spiritual path; Conservative Judaism seemed much more authentic to me than the Reform movement of my childhood. Little by little I edged our kitchen in the kosher direction and I developed a secret hope/plan to enter Conservative rabbinical school after a waiting period of about five years in order to let the plan mature.</p>
               <p>-- In my two job searches, I learned again the great lesson my parents had taught me by writing, against all odds, to Eton back in 1966. After wasting time trying to get a foothold in show business public relations through friends of friends, etc., I got my job at <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title> with the simple direct approach, by just picking up the phone and calling systematically. It was this sense of "Anything's possible" that took me on those secret job-hunting trips to London and Hong Kong and got me my next job, overseas. The same approach had worked when I just showed up at Virgin Records in London in 1972 after wasting time with useless letters of introduction in Paris.</p>
               <p>-- Finally having a creative outlet for my creative energy and worldwide scheme-making in a glamorous, first-class place, <title render="italic">
                     Architectural Digest
                  </title>. My appetite for work was insatiable, as was my ambition. I found my stride, and hit it.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- On June 16, 1981, I left Los Angeles for Hong Kong, where I lived until December 26, 1981. I arrived on Thursday June 18, and was at work the following Monday, after a furiously rushed search for an apartment. After staying my first week or so at the wonderfully old-fashioned Soldiers and Sailors Home in Wanchai (Suzie Wong territory), I found a flat near the Happy Valley race course, and moved in on June 27.</p>
               <p>-- From June to November 1981, I worked at <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek,
                  </title> a weekly news magazine based in Hong Kong. I wrote news articles (which was a good way to see if I wanted to be a writer, which I found I didn't) and did numerous special projects, which included establishing the magazine's first editorial style book and conducting a survey of local conditions in towns and villages throughout Asia, with the help of local English-speaking teachers. In the meantime, I kept lobbying for a job at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> on Fleet Street, which is what I really wanted.</p>
               <p>-- In September 1981, I made a quick trip to New York for the Sotheby's auction of my parents' furniture and to see to estate business.</p>
               <p>-- In October 1981, Jim Ito visited from Los Angeles and took numerous photographs of my life there, which are in the archive.</p>
               <p>-- By the fall of 1981, I had decided to quit <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek,
                  </title> where I was not happy, and spend time traveling, especially in India and Sri Lanka.</p>
               <p>-- November 12, 1981, was my last day at <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- From November 20 to December 14, 1981, I made my first trip to China: Beijing (with an overnight stop in Guangzhou); Shanghai; Hangzhou; by boat on the ancient Grand Canal from Hangzhou to Suzhou; by ocean liner from Shanghai back to Hong Kong. It was a magical time.</p>
               <p>-- December 18, 1981, my sister, Victoria Phillips, arrived in Hong Kong for a visit.</p>
               <p>-- December 26, 1981, I set off on my travels, which lasted until November 1982, when I arrived in London for my job at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title> Victoria was with me for part of the first stop, which was Bangkok.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES</p>
               <p>-- Life in Hong Kong in its last decades of British rule, just before one of the great booms ended (which it did in 1982, when the property speculators' 15-year mortgages ran into the uncertainty of the colony's 1997 return to China).</p>
               <p>-- Life and work at <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek,
                  </title> which billed itself as the more "Asian" of the two English-language weekly newsmagazines based in Hong Kong, its rival being <title render="italic">
                     The Far Eastern Economic Review;
                  </title> it was then owned by Reader's Digest, later sold, now defunct.</p>
               <p>-- How international magazines worked in the days before computers, fax, e-mail or Internet.</p>
               <p>-- More correspondence and negotiations with the famous Fleet Street editor John Anstey of <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- Friendship with the future novelist Linda Jaivin, who was a reporter and my office-mate at <title render="italic">
                     Asiaweek.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- Continuing contacts with Donna M. Liu, my housemate from Taiwan days, who was living in Hong Kong.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files (3 very thin folders), with some glimpses of Hong Kong gay life.</p>
               <p>-- Hong Kong ephemera, especially beautiful graphics (including book covers, cards, anything else on paper).</p>
               <p>-- The old art deco Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Building: catalogue of children's drawings of this skyline landmark just before it was demolished.</p>
               <p>-- Continuing contacts with the Christian Family Service Centre in the Kwun Tong district of Kowloon, the last gasp of my Chinatown and social work interests.</p>
               <p>-- China in the early days of individual travel, when the country still had food rationing; this was just five years after the end of the Cultural Revolution.</p>
               <p>-- Much ephemera and graphics, including examples of the unconsciously retro designs coming out of China.</p>
               <p>-- The loneliness as well as adventure involved in following through on one of my international schemes, being a journalist in Hong Kong and trying out news writing.</p>
               <p>-- More dreams and schemes, this time having to do with travel in India and working in London.</p>
               <p>-- Adjusting to the change in my life now that I had no parents.</p>
               <p>-- Adjusting to having a small financial cushion (which seemed large to me at the time). This money allowed me to dream â€" and live â€" bigger and bigger.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Originals of photographs (photocopies) from the Jim Ito Collection are in the possession of James A. Ito, 1991 North Alexandria Avenue, Los Angeles 90027; (323) 664-4316. Each album page or photo used has a number that corresponds to a page in his albums.</p>
               <p>2) Dates on documents in this series usually follow the British system used in Hong Kong: day/month/year.</p>
               <p>3) Words and spelling also follow British usage, which I had to adopt because I was editing in British English; of course, I got a kick out of it.</p>
               <p>4) Dates in Chinese are expressed year/month/day, so 1981.11.29 is November 29, 1981.</p>
               <p>5) Names: At this period, I was using Tang, not Fei, as my Chinese family name. So my Chinese name appears as TANG Hai-ch'ing.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- My travels began when I left Hong Kong on December 26, 1981, and continued until my arrival in London on November 1, 1982, to take my job at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title> The stages of the trip were:</p>
               <p>a) December 26, 1981-January 21, 1982: Thailand, including Bangkok, the north, and the Khmer ruins of Pimai, in the east;</p>
               <p>b) January 22-February 3, 1982: to London for the memorial service of my beloved cousin Margot Hoare, which included a second interview at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine;
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>c) February 4-April 11, 1982: Sri Lanka, including Galle and two two-week periods in Akurala, a village on the southwest coast five miles south of Ambalangoda that is not even on the map. (Galle and Akurala were badly hit by the 2004 tsunami.) Also Colombo, Kandy, ancient cities, hill country and an east coast beach town;</p>
               <p>d) April 11-May 25, 1982: India, including two weeks in Taj Ganj, an enclave in Agra at the gates of the Taj Mahal originally established for the craftsmen who built the Taj; also New Delhi, Jaipur and Varanasi;</p>
               <p>e) May 25-June 14, 1982: Nepal, staying in Kathmandu to recover from hepatitis A with the help of an Ayurvedic doctor;</p>
               <p>f) June 14-21, 1982: India (New Delhi) again, on my way back to the West;</p>
               <p>g) June 22-July 8, 1982: Paris;</p>
               <p>h) July 8-November 1, 1982: U.S.A. -- California, New York, Cape Cod, and a stuttering elimination program at Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia.</p>
               <p>-- On January 1, 1982, my cousin Margot Hoare died in London.</p>
               <p>-- On March 10, 1982, in Colombo, I received my job offer from <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> on Fleet Street, to be Special Articles Editor, a job created for me. I had been trying to get a job there for more than a year and it was one of the happiest moments of my life to date.</p>
               <p>-- On May 4, 1982, I had an important LSD trip at the Taj Mahal and Taj Ganj.</p>
               <p>-- October 4 to 23, 1982, I was at Hollins College, Roanoke, Virginia, for a stuttering elimination program at the Hollins Communications Research Institute.</p>
               <p>-- On November 1, 1982, I moved to London to begin work at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Life in the places listed above, with ephemera.</p>
               <p>-- Perhaps of special interest is material from Galle and the tiny village of Akurala, on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, where life was altered forever by the 2004 tsunami; Akurala (part of the township of Kahawa, or Kahawe) may have disappeared completely.</p>
               <p>-- Life on the road in the early 1980's, before the Internet, e-mail or cell phones.</p>
               <p>-- An account of an LSD experience in India, at the Taj Mahal.</p>
               <p>-- The logistics of preserving these archives as I traveled, sending parcels of papers home as I went as part of the preparation for leaving each country.</p>
               <p>-- More correspondence and negotiations with the famous Fleet Street editor John Anstey of <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- The death of my cousin Margot Hoare, one of the key figures in my life, and extensive correspondence with her husband, Malcolm V. Hoare (of the British banking family).</p>
               <p>-- Material from the pioneering stuttering therapy program at the Hollins Communications Research Institute, Hollins College, Roanoke, Virginia.</p>
               <p>-- Gay (2 files): Glimpses of gay life in London and ephemera from the U.S.A., including the first glimmers of AIDS.</p>
               <p>-- Renewed contact with Jeff B. Richards, originally of the Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective.</p>
               <p>-- Important developments in my spiritual life, as I continued to think about becoming a Conservative rabbi; this plan was secret, and I had set myself a five-year waiting period to be sure this was what I really wanted. Much of my personal writing during this time is of a devotional nature and set the course for much of my later spiritual development.</p>
               <p>-- Ayurvedic treatment for hepatitis A in Kathmandu.</p>
               <p>-- The thrill of arriving in Paris from India, of going from Asia to the heart of the West. Part of this was the shock of arriving in the world's most worldly place from one of the world's most other-worldly.</p>
               <p>-- My restless dreams and schemes taken to the extreme, with unlimited time and as much money as I needed. This was a solitary time, but not a lonely one. Its rewards are still with me.</p>
               <p>-- The joy of being with friends and family again in the U.S.A., including Jim Ito and Stephen Breimer; after all this solitary wandering I was reminded of the title one of my mother's favorite poems by Edna St. Vincent Millay, <title render="italic">
                     Mine the Harvest.
                  </title> I spent much of that summer assembling resources, addresses and article ideas for my upcoming job on Fleet Street.</p>
               <p>-- Original cassette of another psychic reading with Carol Ann Dryer of Los Angeles. For more of them, see Series VIII.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Originals of photocopies photographs from the Jim Ito Collection are in the possession of James A. Ito, 1991 North Alexandria Avenue, Los Angeles 90027; (323) 664-4316. Each album page or photo used has a number that corresponds to a page number in his albums.</p>
               <p>2) I believe that one parcel of papers and archives sent from India got lost in the mail.</p>
               <p>3) I very often use the British system (day/month/year) for dates, since that was the practice in Hong Kong and in the countries I was visiting.</p>
               <p>4) Financial information and receipts for 1982 are found in Series XI.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- On November 2, 1982, I arrived in London and spent most of a month getting settled and finding my apartment in Chelsea, at 55 Draycott Place, London, S.W.3.</p>
               <p>-- November 29, 1982, I began work at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> on Fleet Street as Special Articles Editor, a job created specially for me.</p>
               <p>-- December 8, 1982, I attended a Royal Ballet gala at Covent Garden, where I sat in a cheap seat directly across from the Prince and Princess of Wales, who were in the royal box. I took copious notes about Charles and Diana, which are included in the archive.</p>
               <p>-- February 1983, I began going to lectures with an Orthodox rabbi in London, Joseph Freilich. My studies with Rabbi Freilich became increasingly intensive, and I slowly moved away from my involvement with West London Synagogue (which was Reform, the British equivalent of Conservative) and deeper into the Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) Movement. I eventually moved to Jerusalem to study in a yeshiva full time.</p>
               <p>-- Also in February 1983, I went to Copenhagen to renew my U.S. passport.</p>
               <p>-- In May 1983, my friend Carol Vogel and my brother David F. Phillips visited and we went traveling in the English countryside.</p>
               <p>-- June 13, 1983, I attended Garter Day at Windsor Castle, where I saw the entire royal family as they walked right past me. The ticket was given to me by Hugo Vickers, my friend from Eton days.</p>
               <p>-- Also in June 1983, <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> invited me to renew my contract for a second six months.</p>
               <p>-- In August 1983, Jim Ito visited and we went traveling in England.</p>
               <p>-- In September 1983, I went to Dublin to meet with Rabbi David J. Seligson, my childhood rabbi from Central Synagogue (Reform), New York, to discuss my plans to become a Conservative rabbi.</p>
               <p>-- Also in September 1983, my plans took final shape not to renew my contract at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine
                  </title> but to go to Israel to study in a yeshiva; I began letting people know about this.</p>
               <p>-- November 25, 1983, was my last day at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- In December, I made a trip to Hamburg, and to Amsterdam, where I met Tito, a Dutchman who became an important relationship and who figures prominently in Series XII.</p>
               <p>-- January 5, 1984, I left my apartment in Chelsea and moved to the Orthodox London neighborhood of Golders Green to live with an Orthodox family and study full time at Rabbi Freilich's yeshiva for my last few weeks in England.</p>
               <p>-- January 18-22, 1984, I visited Gateshead, near Newcastle, rightly called "the last shtetl in Europe," and was exposed to yeshiva life first hand at the famous Gateshead Yeshiva.</p>
               <p>-- On February 13, 1984, I left London for Israel.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Life in London in the heyday of Margaret Thatcher.</p>
               <p>-- <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine,
                  </title> part of the great Tory newspaper empire, in the Thatcher era.</p>
               <p>-- John Anstey, the famous Fleet Street editor who brought color Sunday magazines to Britain in the early 1960's and was often referred to in <title render="italic">
                     Private Eye
                  </title> magazine as "the Abominable Anstey." He was my editor at the magazine.</p>
               <p>-- How a magazine editor assembled ideas and resources in the days before the Internet.</p>
               <p>-- Work with various British writers and photographers.</p>
               <p>-- Short (and mostly not very interesting) letters from John Gielgud, Iris Murdoch, Edward Heath, Hugh Casson, Dirk Bogarde, Harold Acton, Mary McCarthy and Barbara Cartland (with flyleaf and cover of one of her books, inscribed to me) connected with one of my special magazine sections.</p>
               <p>-- The coming of new technology, especially in home computers, hi-fi and video, as reflected in my special sections at <title render="italic">
                     The Telegraph Sunday Magazine,
                  </title> some of which were primers on these still-unfamiliar fields. Other special sections covered Venice, Hong Kong and Singapore, and Wine and Drink (which involved a photography session with Kingsley Amis and others).</p>
               <p>-- Work with Clare Hollingworth, the legendary former defense correspondent of <title render="italic">
                     The Daily Telegraph,
                  </title> who became famous for breaking the story of the German invasion of Poland in 1939 (when she witnessed the tanks coming across the border).</p>
               <p>-- Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) Movement: a great deal of material about the relatively early days of this worldwide movement in England, whose aim is to "bring back" nonobservant Jews into Orthodox Judaism. Material includes notes and tapes of lectures by Rabbi Joseph Freilich of Golders Green, London, one of its pioneers and one of its most eloquent and inspiring teachers (and with an Irish accent). This extraordinary and brilliant man was my main teacher and rabbi during this period and I became close to him and his family; they showed me Jewish life at its best.</p>
               <p>-- What is probably the first recording of Avromi Freilich, Rabbi Freilich's son and today a prominent London cantor; this is on a cassette made for me when he was 12.</p>
               <p>-- The Baal Tshuvah Movement's effect on me.</p>
               <p>-- Some correspondence and a meeting with Rabbi David J. Seligson, rabbi emeritus of Central Synagogue (Reform), New York. He was my childhood rabbi.</p>
               <p>-- Notes of lectures by Rabbi Harold Saperstein of Lynbrook, Long Island (Conservative).</p>
               <p>-- Notes of one lecture by Rabbi Hugo Gryn of West London Synagogue (Reform, the British equivalent of Conservative).</p>
               <p>-- Royal family relics and ephemera, including voluminous notes taken while watching the Prince and Princess of Wales for about three hours; also Garter Day at Windsor Castle and clippings about the royal family, including Prince William as a baby.</p>
               <p>-- My friendship with an old-time London East End Jewish man, Frank Silverstone; he was old and frail at this point and I helped him find his long-lost relatives in Israel. There is also an oral history cassette I made with him.</p>
               <p>-- The blooming of the Thatcherite yuppie phenomenon and the "Sloane Rangers," including two now-rare and seminal books that are not in the Yale Library catalogue. (Another such book, about the "young fogey" phenomenon, is in Series XIII.)</p>
               <p>-- Mayfair Laundry, a hilariously old-fashioned and courtly ladies' and gentlemen's pick-up and delivery service, an Edwardian London holdover.</p>
               <p>-- Friendship with John Calmann's mother and sister, including visits to Perridge House, which was the Calmann family home in Somerset, and close friendship with his friend Richard Sachs.</p>
               <p>-- Philip Core, an American-born gay painter living in London: a little bit of material about him. (Gay researchers, note! He is very important, but little studied.)</p>
               <p>-- Gay-related files (3).</p>
               <p>-- Gay personals ads in the days when everything was done by letter.</p>
               <p>-- The development of my still-secret plan to become a Conservative rabbi, and the shift in course when I embraced Orthodox Judaism.</p>
               <p>-- Correspondence with a rabbi in the U.S.A. about being gay as it related to my plans for rabbinical school.</p>
               <p>-- A gay-related theme in my rabbinical plans was a kind of pastoral instinct, which had driven me at the Gay Community Services Center and later led me, in the 1990's, to the practice of homeopathic medicine.</p>
               <p>-- The continuation of the kind of devotional writing I had been doing in my travels in India and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>-- A reappearance of my childhood obsession with vintage cars, as I bought, and then soon got rid of, a 1953 Austin Somerset.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Names: In the Orthodox Jewish world, which I entered during this period, I was known by my Hebrew name, Chaim Phillips.</p>
               <p>2) Materials relating to my Orthodox Jewish studies are grouped together at the end of the series, and all files begin with the words "Baal Tshuvah," which I translate as "Newly Orthodox." Other Jewish studies are grouped together there as well.</p>
               <p>3) Many of my month-to-month activities can be found in these Baal Tshuvah and Jewish studies files, in addition to the files titled "My Life."</p>
               <p>4) British usage: During this period I switched over entirely to British spellings, vocabulary and dates (day/month/year). This was not an affectation, but something I needed to do because I was editing for a British magazine. To keep things simple, I switched over in most of my personal writings as well. My speech at this period remained 100 per cent American (there is nothing worse than an American with a phony English accent) even though I would use British words for things.</p>
               <p>5) Originals of photocopied photographs from the Jim Ito Collection are in the possession of James A. Ito, 1991 North Alexandria Avenue, Los Angeles 90027; (323) 664-4316. Each album page or photograph used has a number that corresponds to a page in his albums.</p>

               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- February 13-26, 1984, I traveled from London to Israel, via Paris, Venice, and Greece, where I caught a boat for Haifa. By this time I was living as a fully Orthodox Jew.</p>
               <p>-- On February 26, 1984, I arrived in Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>-- Also in February 1984, in my first couple of days in Jerusalem, I ran into my brother Adam Phillips, who had just arrived and was starting to study in a Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) yeshiva called Aish Hatorah, in the Old City. He stayed in Israel until spring 1986.</p>
               <p>-- February 1984 to January 1985, I lived at Ohr Somayach, a Baal Tshuvah yeshiva in the Ma'alot Dafna section of Jerusalem, near the old "Green Line." I was a full-time student at this so-called "back-hat" English-speaking yeshiva that is part of the non-Hassidic, Lithuanian [in Yiddish: Litvak] tradition.</p>
               <p>-- January 1985, I moved from the yeshiva to a little courtyard house, circa 1900, in the Nachla'ot neighborhood of Jerusalem, which I first rented and later bought. My brother Adam Phillips got an apartment nearby.</p>
               <p>-- May 19 to September 8, 1985, I was in the United States, mostly staying in my friend Stephen Breimer's late mother's apartment on the newly gay Upper West Side of New York. But I also spent time in San Francisco, Los Angeles and our family house on Cape Cod. On my way to the States, I spent three weeks in Europe --first visiting Jerome Gold (formerly Crickett Bon Bon of the Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective) and Juliet Man Ray (the artist's widow) in France, then joining my brother David F. Phillips in Spain. I was living a totally Orthodox life on this trip. A visual image from that summer says it all: me, in yarmulke and Orthodox fringes, sitting on the New York subway laughing and gleefully underlining juicy passages in my copy of Diana Vreeland's autobiography.</p>
               <p>-- Fall 1985, I began the process of becoming an immigrant to Israel and enrolled in a Hebrew-language school for immigrants, called an Ulpan; many of my classmates were newly arrived Ethiopians.</p>
               <p>-- January 1986, I started to develop book ideas that eventually grew into a book packaging business, meaning that I produced illustrated books under contract with publishers. This was the beginning of Phillips &amp; Company Books, which brought me back to London to live in September 1987. Also at this time I was doing editing projects for a religious publishing house in Jerusalem, Targum Press, which was just starting up.</p>
               <p>-- March 2-13, 1986, I was in Paris to visit Jerome Gold and to work with Man Ray's widow, Juliet Man Ray, on a book; Jerry was her administrator and personal assistant. The original idea was a book about Juliet to be produced by the late John Calmann's book packaging firm in London, with assistance from me. This eventually became a new illustrated edition <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait,
                  </title> Man Ray's autobiography, the first title produced by my own company. I spent a great deal of time in Man Ray's studio and darkroom on the Rue Férou in Paris, which had not been changed at all since his death, in 1976.</p>
               <p>-- Winter 1985-86, I broke with Orthodox Judaism and stopped living according to Jewish law. I remained in Israel, however, and was discreet about this change when I was in Jerusalem. Little by little, I left the Orthodox milieu and rejoined my old ambitions in the wider world, especially publishing. I did the same thing in my spiritual life: since I remained convinced that Orthodoxy was the authentic version of Judaism, I could not go back to the Conservative path.  So my own personal approach to God and prayer, which had been strong since earliest childhood, was allowed to flourish again, away from the rules and regulations of religion.</p>
               <p>-- Spring 1986, my brother Adam Phillips left Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>-- September 1986, when I was visiting Amsterdam, my friend Tito (an important involvement starting in 1983) was diagnosed with cancer. From September 1986 until summer 1987 I made constant visits to Amsterdam to see him during his (successful) treatment, at least once a month, often more.</p>
               <p>-- The years 1986 and 1987 saw constant overseas travel, sometimes more than once a month. In addition to the United States, I shuttled back and forth to Paris and London, where I was producing the Man Ray <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait
                  </title> (my designer was in London, but the Man Ray material was in Paris). All the while I was making my trips to Amsterdam to see Tito, and even tried to get one Targum Press book designed there.</p>
               <p>-- December 1986, I had my first Phillips &amp; Company Books sales meeting with Little, Brown, in Boston. They bought the Man Ray <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait
                  </title>project, to be published fall 1988. With my first deal in hand, I had a real company.</p>
               <p>-- April 1987, I attended a course on book production in England. This was urgently needed since I had a contract for producing a book but not the slightest idea how to do it.</p>
               <p>-- Summer 1987, I was on the road without a break, from June 2 to August 17, producing the Man Ray book in cheap hotel rooms and friends' apartments.</p>
               <p>-- On September 8, 1987, I moved back to London from Jerusalem to try my hand at being an international book publisher.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- Life in Israel, 1984-87, a peaceful time in Jewish-Arab relations.</p>
               <p>-- Immigrant absorption in Israel, including a government language school, called an Ulpan.</p>
               <p>-- Yeshiva life in Israel.</p>
               <p>-- The so-called "Ultra-Orthodox" world in Israel (called in Hebrew "Haredi": this is different from Hassidic).</p>
               <p>-- I was doing quite a bit of devotional writing at this period (reflected in the diaries as well as these folders).</p>
               <p>-- The Baal Tshuvah (Newly Orthodox) world, showing how yeshivas and rabbis molded Westernized young men and women into Orthodox Jews; includes notes and cassettes from lectures and classes. There is a lot of material from Ohr Somayach yeshiva.</p>
               <p>-- How a Baal Tshuvah broke with Orthodox Judaism.</p>
               <p>-- Jerusalem: the Nachla'ot neighborhood of alleyways alongside the central fruit and vegetable market. It is now a chic artists' quarter, but then it was an undiscovered poor neighborhood, the home of Orthodox Middle Eastern Jews.</p>
               <p>-- Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective, Los Angeles: renewed contact with Jerome Gold (previously Crickett Bon Bon), who was then living in Paris as the personal assistant to Man Ray's widow, Juliet Man Ray.</p>
               <p>-- Visits with Juliet Man Ray in Paris and to Man Ray's studio, which was untouched since his death in 1976.</p>
               <p>-- The start of my "book packaging" business, which meant developing and producing book projects under contract from publishers; this business caused me to move back to London in September 1987.</p>
               <p>-- Book publishing and publishers in London and U.S.A.</p>
               <p>-- The last years of book production under the old technology, before computers took over; included are examples, in things I was writing, of how the old "cut-and-paste" editing system worked, before word processing.</p>
               <p>-- The start-up of the Targum Press, an English-language religious book publishing house in Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>-- The London property market, 1986-87: rentals and prices.</p>
               <p>-- Travels in France, Spain, Britain and U.S.A. while keeping Orthodox Jewish laws.</p>
               <p>-- Life in Amsterdam in its filthy, druggy nadir of the mid-1980's.</p>
               <p>-- Francisco Franco: a piece of ephemeral fan memorabilia still being sold on the streets of Madrid in 1985.</p>
               <p>-- My gradual transformation from a small view of life, centered on the inward-looking worlds of Israel and the yeshiva, to my customary wide-screen view as I traveled and started launching myself in a glamorous-sounding international business.</p>
               <p>-- An extreme version of running before I could walk: starting a book publishing company without ever having set foot inside a book publishing house. Having no any idea how a book was produced, I had to learn along the way.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files (9) include material from Israel, especially the early days of the Israeli gay rights movement (including material from the Society for the Protection of Individual Rights, in Hebrew); also material from Britain, France, U.S.A., Greece, Korea and Taiwan.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Names: During this period, I was known in Israel under my Hebrew name, Chaim Phillips, though many official documents continue to say Christopher.</p>
               <p>2) The name of the yeshiva where I was studying is Ohr Somayach. In Hebrew it is called Yeshivat Ohr Somayach (note the final "t," which is there for grammatical reasons), so in writing about it in English I have called it Ohr Somayach yeshiva, with a lower-case "y."</p>
               <p>3) The plural of the noun Baal Tshuvah, referring to Newly Orthodox individuals, is Baalei Tshuvah. I have avoided this usage, since it might be unfamiliar.</p>
               <p>4) Materials relating to classes and lectures at Ohr Somayach yeshiva and other Baal Tshuvah institutions are grouped together at the end of the series. The theme of Baal Tshuvah life runs throughout this series and the London 1982-84 Series as well. While my lecture notes are in English, many of the words and phrases are in Hebrew, Aramaic or Yiddish, all using the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
               <p>5) Materials relating to specific book projects are grouped together after the chronological files. Man Ray <emph render="italic">Self Portrait</emph>material appears in Series XIII, as does material relating to his widow, Juliet Man Ray.</p>
               <p>6) Dates: I normally used the British dating system, day/month/year, which is customary in Israel and that I had been used to since Hong Kong and London. Sometimes, though, I do it the American way.</p>
               <p>7) Financial data and receipts for 1987, and for Man Ray-related activities in 1986 and 1987, are found in Series XIII.</p>

               <p>DATES AND EVENTS:</p>
               <p>-- On September 8, 1987, I moved back to London from Jerusalem. I stayed until February 13, 1991, when I returned to New York. During this time in England I lived in two Georgian flats in Bloomsbury and had a business as a book packager. Book packaging involves developing ideas and dummies for book projects, selling the ideas to publishers and then producing the books, under the publisher's imprint, through the printing and binding stage. I had my own one-man company, Phillips &amp; Company Books, until April 1990, when I joined a large London book packaging firm, Quarto Publishing, where I stayed until December of that year.</p>
               <p>-- I did four books: 1) New illustrated edition of Man Ray's <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait
                  </title> with an Afterword by Juliet Man Ray, fall 1988; 2) <title render="italic">
                     Riding the Skies: Classic Posters From the Golden Age of Flying
                  </title> with an Introduction by Jan Morris, spring 1989; 3) a newly condensed and edited illustrated edition of <title render="italic">
                     Arabia Deserta
                  </title> by Charles M. Doughty, fall 1989; and <title render="italic">
                     In transition: A Paris Anthology
                  </title> with an Introduction by Noël Riley Fitch, spring 1990 (this book was bought for Doubleday by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis).</p>
               <p>-- September 25, 1987, I moved into a rented flat at 2 Doughty Street, London WC1N 2PH, where I stayed until the next fall. In its own quiet way, Doughty Street is one the best Georgian streets in London. <title render="italic">
                     The Spectator
                  </title> magazine was directly across the street from me, and Charles Dickens's house was right up the block.</p>
               <p>-- May 1988, I had my first meeting with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at Doubleday in New York.</p>
               <p>-- July 1988, my first book, <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait
                  </title>by Man Ray, was published.</p>
               <p>-- October 1988, I moved next door to 4 Doughty Street, into a flat that I bought, and I remained there until I left England.</p>
               <p>-- Also in October 1988, I went to the Frankfurt Book Fair with a catalogue of book projects to sell to publishers. I went solo, with no booth of my own: my "office" was the coat-check room at the fairgrounds.</p>
               <p>-- In December 1988, my immigration status in Britain was regularized and I was given permission to live and work in the country without any restrictions of any kind. This was a big load off my mind. Had I wanted to, I could eventually have applied for a British passport.</p>
               <p>-- April 1989, my second book, <title render="italic">
                     Riding the Skies: Classic Posters From the Golden Age of Flying
                  </title>, was published.</p>
               <p>-- August 1989, my third book, <title render="italic">
                     Arabia Deserta,
                  </title> by Charles M. Doughty, was published.</p>
               <p>-- November 17-20, 1989, my friend Lynn MacRitchie and I went for a weekend in East Berlin. It was the week that the Berlin Wall opened.</p>
               <p>-- March 1990, my fourth and last book, <title render="italic">
                     In transition: A Paris Anthology,
                  </title> was published.</p>
               <p>-- April 1990, I joined Quarto Publishing, a large London book packaging firm. My brief was to develop my own imprint of high-end books there. I began making sales trips for Quarto to the U.S.A., and was named Director of North American Sales. Those trips took me to America almost every month and gave me a taste for moving back to the States.</p>
               <p>-- September 1990 saw the death of Jerome Gold, Juliet Man Ray's administrator and my great friend since 1973, when he joined the Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective calling himself Crickett Bon Bon.</p>
               <p>-- Also in September 1990, Joyce Block, an artist and my friend since Stanford Summer School (1970), died. I was her executor and heir.</p>
               <p>-- October 1990, I went to the Frankfurt Book Fair, this time not by myself, but as part of Quarto Publishing.</p>
               <p>-- December 1990, my relationship with Quarto dissolved and I decided to move back to New York.</p>
               <p>-- On February 13, 1991, after 10 years overseas, I moved back to New York, where I had not lived since 1972, the summer after college. And with that ends the first installment of the Christopher Phillips Papers.</p>
               <p>PERSONAL AND LARGER THEMES:</p>
               <p>-- The book packaging industry in London.</p>
               <p>-- Book publishing and publishers in England, U.S.A. and Europe.</p>
               <p>-- Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd., London, in their very early days. They published my first three books, which were on their earliest lists. Bloomsbury is now huge, thanks to the Harry Potter books, but then they were just starting out.</p>
               <p>-- The making of my four Phillips &amp; Company books at a time when the technology was shifting over to computers.</p>
               <p>-- The great London book designer David Fordham, who was responsible for three of my four books.</p>
               <p>-- Quarto Publishing, the large British book packager, for whom I worked in 1990.</p>
               <p>-- Life in Britain in the waning years of Margaret Thatcher and beyond.</p>
               <p>-- The ripening of Thatcherite yuppiedom, including an important ephemeral book on the "young fogey" phenomenon. See also similar books in Series XI.</p>
               <p>-- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: she was the editor at Doubleday who bought my last book, <title render="italic">
                     In transition.
                  </title> I first saw her on a selling trip in May 1988, and she wanted to publish <title render="italic">
                     Arabia Deserta
                  </title> as well. She loved my work and, before we were on a first-name basis, once blurted out, "Oh, Mr. Phillips... everything you do is so... beautiful!" She made me promise to show her all my book projects first. She alone of all my publishing contacts offered to help me when I was making plans to move back to New York.</p>
               <p>-- Kay Boyle, one of the last of the Paris generation. We had a lively correspondence, and I visited her in California.</p>
               <p>-- Wilfred Thesiger, the last of the great explorers. I got to know him a bit when I needed his blessing and jacket blurb for my new edition of <title render="italic">
                     Arabia Deserta.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- Juliet Man Ray, Man Ray's widow. There is biographical information about her here, including an oral history cassette I made with her and her brother. She made the new edition of Man Ray <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait
                  </title> possible by giving me carte blanche in Man Ray's studio and darkroom in Paris (now destroyed), which had remained virtually untouched since Man Ray's death, in 1976. There are photographs here of the studio, where I spent many, many hours working with Juliet.</p>
               <p>-- Man Ray: there are many photographs by him and of his artwork, including the ones published in my edition of <title render="italic">
                     Self Portrait,
                  </title> and many that have never been published. Many of these photographs were reproduced by me from glass negatives I found in his darkroom.</p>
               <p>-- Correspondence with some of the great surviving B.O.A.C. poster artists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, to obtain rights and permissions for <title render="italic">
                     Riding the Skies.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- My work with the author Jan Morris on <title render="italic">
                     Riding the Skies.
                  </title>
               </p>
               <p>-- Vintage photographs of Arabia and bedouin life, by Gertrude Bell and others. Many of these photographs were not included in my edition of <title render="italic">
                     Arabia Deserta,
                  </title> and have still never been published.</p>
               <p>-- Correspondence about rights and permissions with writers and artists (or their heirs or agents) whose work had appeared in <title render="italic">
                     transition,
                  </title> the greatest of the English-language magazines published in Paris in the 1920's and 30's.</p>
               <p>-- The process of tracking down holders of rights for dead writers and artists in the days before the Internet or e-mail.</p>
               <p>-- The Israeli Women of Achievement book proposal by the Jerusalem sociologist Beverly Mizrachi contains many valuable oral history cassettes with these prominent Israeli women and a short book about them by Beverly Mizrachi published by the American Jewish Committee.</p>
               <p>-- Frankfurt Book Fairs, 1988 and 1990.</p>
               <p>-- London property market, rentals and sales, 1987 and 1988.</p>
               <p>-- Gay Community Services Center and Highland Park Collective, Los Angeles (1973-75). Close contacts with Jeff B. Richards and especially with Jerome Gold (originally met as Crickett Bon Bon), who was at this time Juliet Man Ray's administrator in Paris.</p>
               <p>-- A visit to East Berlin the week the Berlin Wall opened.</p>
               <p>-- Gay files (14), including material from England, U.S.A., Barcelona and Taiwan. Some material about the artist Philip Core and writer and performance artist Neil Bartlett.</p>
               <p>-- AIDS and H.I.V. attitudes in England in the 1980's, as evidenced by a routine form letter and questionnaire sent to me as part of an application for a life insurance policy (a requirement for getting a mortgage in England); it asked about homosexual activity and whether I had received an H.I.V. test (positive or negative) or even any medical advice about any sexually transmitted disease.</p>
               <p>-- The world of gay personal ads before the days of the Internet.</p>
               <p>-- The loneliness of running a one-man business in a foreign country all by myself, made all the worse by my total lack of experience in book publishing and the dramatic fall of the dollar against the pound my first week back in London. This experience was, in a way, a culmination of my tendency toward grand schemes and my habit of running before I could walk.</p>
               <p>-- London in its transition from 1980's boom to early-1990's economic slump.</p>
               <p>-- The definitive end (so far, at least) of my on-again off-again love affair with London.</p>
               <p>-- My rediscovery, on my constant selling trips, of the pleasure of being in the United States and of the value of living not in a foreign country but in one's native place, especially when that native place happens to be New York City.</p>
               <p>NOTES:</p>
               <p>1) Files for individual books and book ideas, and for certain individuals (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Kay Boyle and Wilfred Thesiger), are grouped together at the end of the series.</p>
               <p>2) During this period there were always several book projects going on at once, some in the selling, editing or production stages, some just being developed as ideas. For an understanding of most of my day-to-day activities, please see the files for individual books and book ideas.</p>
               <p>3) A note on accents. As I did in my last London period, 1982-84, I kept my American accent intact, without letting a trace of British creep in. There is nothing that sounds worse than an American with a fake British overlay. Plus, sounding American put me automatically outside the British class system and the straight-jacket that imposes. However, I went completely to British spellings and words for things and the British dating system, which I had to, since I was an editor and had a British-based company. I had been using British forms basically since I left America to go to Hong Kong in 1981.</p>
               <p>4) Originals of photocopied photographs from the Jim Ito Collection are in the possession of James A. Ito, 1991 North Alexandria Avenue, Los Angeles 90027; (323) 664-4316. Each album page or photo used has a number that corresponds to a page in his albums.</p>
               <p>5) It is worth emphasizing that I do not own copyright to the photographs by Man Ray and others in these files.</p>
               <p>6) Note the lower-case "t" in the name of the magazine <title render="italic">
