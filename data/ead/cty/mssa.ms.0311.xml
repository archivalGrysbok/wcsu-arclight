         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Alexander Kesküla became a bolshevik at the beginning of 1905 when he was a student at Tartu in Estonia. He was imprisoned later that year, but in three months was released after a popular uprising. Kesküla lived illegally in Estonia for two more years and Russian historical works reveal that he was a leading bolshevik underground organizer in Estonia during the years 1905-7. In 1907 Kesküla moved to Moscow, staying there illegally for several months. He left Russia in 1908, living first in Germany, where he attended the universities of Berlin and Leipzig, and after, in 1910, in Switzerland where he studied in Zurich and Bern.</p>
         <p>In September, 1914, at the outbreak of war between Germany and Russia, Kesküla contacted Gisbert von Romberg, the German minister in Bern. Keskula's aims were the independence of' Estonia and the exclusion of' Russia from Europe. He believed that revolution in Russia could not be forced, but instead, was the third link in a chain he envisioned. First, the Russian army must be smashed-that was the task of the German army. Second, the western borderlands of Russia would be occupied and Sweden, Finland and Estonia would form a federation. Third, after military defeat and the occupation of the borderlands, the Russian revolution would occur and, in Kesküla's opinion, the man to accomplish this was V. I. Lenin.</p>
         <p>Kesküla's contacts with both Germans and bolsheviks were merely elements in his broad design of independence for Estonia. From his knowledge of the Russian revolutionary movement he was convinced of Lenin's pre-eminence as a revolutionary leader, from the resources made available to him by the Germans he supported the bolsheviks and he strove to impress on the Germans Lenin's potentialities.</p>
         <p>In 1915, returning to Switzerland from Stockholm, Kesküla met another Estonian, Arthur Siefeldt (or Zifeldt), who was in contact with Lenin and his organization. It was through Siefeldt and Kesküla that the indirect link between the bolsheviks and Germans operated. Keskiila supplied Siefeldtwith money, which Siefeldt infiltrated into the bolshevik organization, and, in turn, Siefeldt gave Keskiila information from Lenin's circle which Kesküla then transmitted to the Germans. This arrangement continued until the summer of 1916. Then Keskula's relations with the Germans cobled. Sometime afterwards, Siefeldt quarrelled with Lenin over the national question, and his close contact with Lenin and Keskiila ceased. Keskiila received no more money from the Germans after October 1916, and finally broke with them in the spring of 1917. He turned his attention to Sweden attempting to influence opinion for Sweden's entry into the war which would lead to the occupation of Finland and Estonia. The final outcome would be his longheld dream of a Swedish- Finnish- Estonian federation; in this he failed.</p>
         <p>Later, leaving Switzerland, Kesküla lived with-his Swiss born wife in Stocksund, on the northern side of Stockholm. He left there sometime around 1923. Keskula died in Madrid in 1964.</p>
         <p>Though his grandiose political design was not realized, it may be suggested that Alexander Kesküla's place in history is secure. He not only appreciated Lenin' s qualities and potentialities, but also transmitted this appreciation to German authorities. His friend in Switzerland, the German minister Romberg, was one of the Germans chiefly concerned with Lenin's, journey from Switzerland through Germany to Russia in April 1917. Moreover, Kesküla's assistance to the bolsheviks came at a time when their fortunes were low, both literally and metaphorically.</p>
