         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>William Vinal Caldwell, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, graduated from the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1941. He was primarily a portrait artist until his induction into the army in 1942. Stationed at Fort McClellan, Caldwell was attached to the Plans and Training Department, drawing tactical charts, maps, and diagrams. From 1944-1945 he served in Italy as a regimental artist, documenting the American servicemen's role in the Italian campaign. Following the war, Caldwell returned to his career as a portrait artist.</p>
