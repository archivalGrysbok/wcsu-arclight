      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Daniel Curtis Rand was born February 1, 1820, and grew up in Charleston, New
                Hampshire. He attended from Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, and
                graduated with the class of 1839. Rand attended Wesleyan University in Middletown,
                Connecticut, and graduated in the class of 1843. After a short traveling tour in New
                York and Connecticut he settled in Middletown for a little while longer and worked
                with his sister Lucia at the powder mill his family owned. An informal ledger of
                mill accounts can be found in the middle section of Rand's journal. Rand eventually
                settled in Pittsford, New York where he opened his own powder mill, manufacturing blasting powder used in New York stone quarries and Pennsylvania coal
                mines, in addition to regular gun powder. Rand entered into a business partnership
                with Mortimer Wadhams, and they named their plant Rand and Wadhams Manufacturing of
                Mining, Blasting and Sporting Powder. It remained so until 1900 when it was renamed
                the D. C. Rand Powder Co. Daniel married Wadhams' daughter Stella in 1864, and the
                couple had four sons, Mortimer, Robert, Samuel, and Phillip, and three daughters,
                Lucia, Lucy, and Stella. Upon Rand's death, Stella and her 14-year-old son Phillip
                took over the business, which continued to operate until about 1910 after a series
                of unfortunate explosions. The site of the Rands' home was called Oakridge, and this
                property is now a part of a county park, aptly named <emph render="doublequote">Powder Mills Park.</emph></p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Daniel C. Rand Journal, which covers his four years at Wesleyan University,
                is highly informative in nature. Just like many other young men
                of the time, Rand treated his journal as a ledger with no expense too trivial to
                record. There are limited portions where Rand writes a paragraph or two about the
                end of a semester, or his journey from New Hampshire to Connecticut, but generally
                these portions are very formal. Rand recorded purchases and expenditures by date
                over the first fifty pages of the journal. These fifty pages take the reader from the fall
                of 1839 as Rand journeyed to Wesleyan as a freshman, to the late summer of 1843 when
                he graduates. Included in his expenses are book lists, tuition, clothing, and little
                incidentals such as outings on the river or peaches from local farmers. His
                collection of lists paints an image of a time when a semester's tuition was less
                than $40, when students attended lectures on such stylish subjects as phrenology for
                entertainment, and when a month-long trip to New York in the summer was the height
                of luxury. Marginal notes about items such as his acceptance of a teaching position at a Middletown school for $17
                a month in 1841 or his attempts to record step-by-step instructions to popular
                dances add a dose of character to the journal. Other
                highlights include dues paid to the mysterious Pi Omicron Psi society, which Rand
                always writes in Greek letters.</p>
      <p>There are two other sections in Rand's journal. The first is his written
                accounts of business conducted at his family's powder mill in 1844 and 1845, and the
                second is the minutes, constitution, and by-laws of the Union Eloquium's Society in
                Meriden, New Hampshire. It appears that Rand was the secretary of this society
                before he left for college in 1839.</p>
