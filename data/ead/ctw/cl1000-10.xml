      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>This collection contains records of rowing/crew at Wesleyan University in the 1870s and 1880s. At the time, each class of students at Wesleyan organized its own rowing club. The class of 1873 Boat Club was organized on October 4, 1870, by 19 members of the class of 1873. It participated in the first Wesleyan regatta, which was held July 19, 1871, with the clubs of the classes of 1872, 1873, and 1874 competing.

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>Club records include its constitution and bylaws, minutes of early meetings, membership lists, and records of competitions. The newspaper clippings in this collection document Wesleyan-related rowing events as well as rowing competitions in the eastern United States and England. The two general rowing scrapbooks were collected by John E. Eustis '1874 in the years following his graduation from Wesleyan. Eustis was a captain of the 1874 club and, after leaving Wesleyan, became a captain and leader of New York's Atalanta Boat Club and a referee of collegiate regattas.</p>
      <p>Also included in this collection are a hand-drawn map of the Saratoga Regatta course (1875), and programs of Wesleyan Regattas (1881-1882).</p>
