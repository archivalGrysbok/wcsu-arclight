      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Physiological Society of Wesleyan University was a direct response to <emph render="doublequote">Grahamism,</emph> a movement concentrating on regulating
                diet and lifestyle to temper impulsiveness, mental health, and sexuality. Grahamites
                practiced a strict vegetarian diet, also cutting out sugar, white bread, and most
                importantly, alcohol. The Grahamist movement was inspired by American reformer
                Sylvester Graham, who in 1829 invented <emph render="doublequote">Graham
                    bread,</emph> today know as the Graham cracker. Graham wrote extensively for his
                followers, but his best known works were the <title render="italic">Lectures on the
                    Science of Human Life</title> (Boston, 1839), and <title render="italic">Lectures to Young Men on Chastity</title>. The ties that Wesleyan’s
                Physiological Society held to the Grahamist movement are evidenced by an
                announcement of the club's inception in the 1839 edition of The Graham Journal of
                Health and Longevity, as well as in the Society’s own records. The Society appears
                to have disbanded for good sometime in April 1844, seven years before Sylvester
                Graham's own death and a subsequent decrease in Grahamism's popularity.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This book contains the records of two incarnations of the early Wesleyan University
                student group, the Physiological Society. The first section begins with a
                constitution written in 1839 with articles concerning the election of leadership,
                and goes on to by-laws explaining how meetings should be run, and what form they
                should take. Next are entries of minutes for the nine meetings held between May and
                November 1839, and then the account skips to an entry written in May 1842 explaining
                how the Society disbanded in November 1839. The second section contains a new and
                more detailed constitution and a comprehensive members list. Minutes of meetings for
                this later incarnation of the group date from May 1842 to April 1844.</p>
      <p>Generally, the first half of this collection is very formal and not entirely
                informative about the Society's aims. There is much discussion about electing
                leadership, raising funds to create library, and generally setting the groundwork
                for a structure. The second half of the record, however, is much more detailed. In
                the second constitution, the Society speaks of the virtues of physical purity,
                mental and moral improvement, and the <emph render="doublequote">all controlling
                    sympathies which exist between body, mind and spirit.</emph> The Society brought
                in honorary members such as local physicians and Wesleyan professors to speak and
                lead meetings, although there was also a great tradition of student oration: topics
                included Tobacco, Animal Heart and Muscular Action, and <title render="doublequote">Savage Life Considered with Reference to Health and Longevity.</title>
