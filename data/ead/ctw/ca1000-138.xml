      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Arthur Benjamin Calef was born in Sanbornton, NH on June 30, 1825. He attended Wesleyan University between 1847 and 1851. He studied law in Middletown, CT, serving as clerk of the Middlesex County courts for eight years. In 1855, he was elected State Treasurer of Connecticut; three years later, he was elected Middletown City Attorney. He also served as a Middletown councilman, alderman and recorder. He was trustee, secretary, lecturer on constitutional law, and president of both Psi U and the Alumni Association at Wesleyan University. In 1860 and 1864, he was a delegate to the National Republican Convention. He served as postmaster - elected by Republicans - from 1861 - 1869. From 1884 - 1895, Calef was Middletown City Court Judge. He was a Son of the American Revolution and a Freemason. He died in 1900.</p>
      <p>John Woodruff was born in West Hartford, CT on February 12, 1826. He received little schooling and moved to New Haven in 1845, where, three years later, he was elected a member of the common council. He served in the Thirty-fourth Congress (March 1855 - March 1857) as a member of the American Party, and, after unsuccessfully running for reelection to the Thirty-fifth Congress, was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-sixth Congress (March 1859 - March 1861). In 1862, he was appointed internal revenue collector for the second district of Connecticut. He died in 1868.</p>
