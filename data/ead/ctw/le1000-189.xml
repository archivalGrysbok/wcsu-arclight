      <p>Philip Levy (1909-1970), was a government official and lawyer involved with national labor
    policy, civil rights and anti-lynching policy, immigration leniency for German refugees during
    the Nazi era, national health insurance initiatives, and banking and currency during the 1930s
    and 1940s. From 1947-1970 he practiced law in a private firm, dealing with Jewish refugees,
    congressional and political reform, and foreign claims against the U.S. government. Throughout
    his long career he maintained an interest in labor policy and lectured at American University
    Law School in Washington, D.C.</p>

            <event>On April 9, 1934, Mr. Levy joined legal staff of National Labor Relations Board under
       General Counsel Milton Handler and Associate General Counsel William Gorham Rice, Jr. The
       Board was created under Section 7 (a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of June
       16, 1933.</event>
            <event>NEW DEAL LABOR POLICY. The United States Supreme Court on May 27, 1935 in Schechter
       Corporation v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, held key sections of the NIRA invalid. The legal
       staff of the Labor Board had already been at work formulating a new national labor policy in
       cooperation with Senator Wagner and the Roosevelt administration. The National Labor
       Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, known popularly as the Wagner Act, which became law on July 5,
       1935, established a permanent National Labor Relations Board to assure good-faith collective
       bargaining in industries engaged in interstate commerce. </event>

          <eventgrp>
            <event>Served on legal staff of the National Labor Relations Board under General Counsel
       Charles Fahy. Mr. Levy rose to the position of senior attorney and chief of the Appellate
       Litigation Section and thus helped formulate the defense of the Wagner Act in the courts. He
       argued some cases in the lower courts across the country - in addition to brief
       writing.</event>
            <event>The United States Supreme Court on April 12, 1937 in five Wagner Act cases, led by NLRB
       v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1, ruled the National Labor Relations
       Act of 1935 constitutional. [For a full discussion of this subject, see Irving Bernstein,
        <title render="italic">The New Deal Collective Bargaining Policy</title> (Berkeley and Los
       Angeles: University of California Press, 1950).] </event>

            <event>COUNSEL TO SENATOR WAGNER. In November, 1937, Mr. Levy became Legislative Counsel to
       Senator Robert F. Wagner. Mr. Wagner (1877-1953), a Democrat from New York, served in the
       United States Senate from 1927 until 1949 when he resigned owing to ill health. As
       Legislative Counsel, Mr. Levy succeeded Leon Keyserling. His duties included service to
       Senator Wagner in his capacity as Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. [Regarding
       Wagner and the Senate in those years, see J. Joseph Huthmacher, <title render="italic">Senator Robert F. Wagner and the Rise of Urban Liberalism</title> (New York: Atheneum,
       1968). ] After Mr. Levy's service, the professional staff for Congress was vastly increased
       under provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act of August 2, 1946. [P.L. 79601.] </event>
            <event>Mr. Levy helped draft legislation and arranged hearings on several subjects which
       Congress did not approve but which have had enduring importance. </event>
            <event>ANTI-LYNCHING BILL, 1938. Civil rights was one of Mr. Levy's major interests, expressed
       notably as one of the draftsmen of the Wagner-Van Nuys anti-lynching bill, an amendment to
       H.R. 1507, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. The bill made lynching a federal crime, would prosecute
       negligent law enforcement officials, and would fine the county within which the lynching took
       place. The Senate voted on February 21, 1938, to table the bill, following eight weeks of
       filibuster by the bill's opponents, including several Southern Democratic Senators and
       Senator William Borah, Republican of Idaho. Failure of President Roosevelt to take a strong
       stand in favor of the bill hindered its chances for passage. [For the civil rights context
       and a discussion of the momentous filibuster, see Robert F. Zangrando, "The NAACP and a
       Federal Lynching Bill, 1934-1940," <title render="italic">Journal of Negro History</title>,
       Vol. 50 (April 1965), pp. 106-117. Also a Bobbs-Merrill Reprint in Black Studies, No. BC-33l.
       The filibuster can also be followed in Congo Rec., 75th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 138-161 and pp.
       2090-2118 passim (1938).] </event>
            <event>WAGNER-ROGERS BILL FOR CHILD REFUGEES FROM NAZI GERMANY, 1939. Passionately concerned
       with the harsh policies of Nazi Germany, Mr. Levy helped draft the Wagner-Rogers Bill, S.J.
       Res. 64, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1278 (1939). An attempt to liberalize the Immigration Act
       of 1924, the bill allowed for the entrance of twenty thousand German refugees ages fourteen
       and under, during a two-year period. These refugees would not be counted against the national
       quota for Germany. Patriotic orders, such as the American Legion, opposed the measure,
       claiming it would "deprive American children." Once again the President failed to give the
       bill his strong support, and on June 30, 1939, the Senate Immigration Committee barely passed
       a hopelessly emasculated bill that would not allow the refugee youths to be counted
       independently of the national origins quota for Germany. [For details, see David S. Wyman,
        <title render="italic">Paper Walls: America and the Refugee Crisis</title> 1938-1941
       (Amherst, Mass.: University of Massachusetts Press, 1968), and Arthur D. Morse, <title render="italic">While Six Million Died: A Chronicle of American Apathy</title> (New York:
       Random House, 1967).] </event>
            <event>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. The Medicare programs developed as law in the 1960s were
       anticipated by the pioneer health bills developed in part by Mr. Levy and championed by
       Senator Robert F. Wagner in the 1930s. President Roosevelt never recommended a national
       health insurance program and the Social Security Act became law August 14, 1935 without it.
       In 1943 the first "Wagner-Murray-Dingell" bill (S. 1161, H.R. 2861, 78th Cong., 1st Sess.)
       was introduced. This measure included a compulsory national health-insurance system for
       persons of all ages, to be financed through a payroll tax. The bill died in 1944 at the end
       of the 78th Congress. Mr. Levy cherished his legislative work on this idea as the most
       important in his career. [For a full account of this episode, see Daniel S. Hirshfield,
        <title render="italic">The Lost Reform: The Campaign for Compulsory Health Insurance in the
        United States from 1932 to 1943</title> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1970).]

          <event>In World War II, Mr. Levy served in the United States Army, Judge Advocate General

            <event>Following the war, Mr. Levy returned to serve as counsel to the Senate Banking and
       Currency Committee then chaired by Senator Charles Tobey (1880-1953), a Republican from New
       Hampshire and member of the Senate from 1939 to 1953. </event>
            <event>SENATE BANKING AND CURRENCY COMMITTEE. Mr. Levy estimated 80 per cent of his time as a
       lawyer in the United States Senate was spent on the activities of the Banking and Currency
       Committee, which covered a wide area. Those subjects included early public housing, urban
       renewal, work of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange
       Commission, export controls, Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Bank, International
       Monetary Fund and domestic relief programs. The Committee also dealt with wartime economic
       controls and small business liquidation. </event>

            <event>WASHINGTON LAWYER. From 1947 onward Mr. Levy was in private law practice in Washington,
       D. C., in partnership with Charles Fahy. Mr. Fahy left the firm in 1952 upon his appointment
       as Circuit Judge in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by President Truman.
       Sharing a suite with Fahy and Levy were Rufus Poole and Milton Denbo, John A. Danaher and
       Barrett Quirk. This loose-knit firm existed for about six years. From 1953 to 1970 Mr. Levy
       was a self-employed lawyer in private practice in Washington. [For a broad discussion of this
       topic, not connected specifically to Mr. Levy's work at all, see Charles Horsky, <title render="italic">The Washington Lawyer </title>(Boston: Little, Brown and Co.,
       1953).]</event>
            <event>PALESTINE. Senator Wagner was vitally interested in the plight of the Jews and in
       Palestine, and Mr. Levy was his close advisor. Their tireless effort to save lives of Jews in
       Nazi Germany before and during the Second World War was followed by an active concern for
       refugees and the establishment of a Jewish state afterwards. Mr. Levy prepared a number of
       Senator Wagner's speeches on these subjects. In law practice, Charles Fahy and Philip Levy
       together represented the government of the then Palestine a short time before the declaration
       of the State of Israel. On May 14, 1948 the State of Israel was proclaimed at Tel-Aviv. On
       the same day it received de facto recognition from the United States through the action of
       President Truman. After that time, Mr. Levy had no formal or professional ties, other than
       that of the concerned citizen. </event>
            <event>CONGRESSIONAL AND POLITICAL REFORM. An abiding interest in American political
       institutions on the part of Philip Levy was expressed in a series of essay reviews on
       Congress and the parties. Mr. Levy reviewed <title render="italic">Congress at the
        Crossroads</title> by George B. Galloway and <title render="italic">Twentieth Century
        Congress</title> by Estes Kefauver and Jack Levin [<title render="italic">Columbia Law

          <eventgrp>
            <event>FOREIGN CLAIMS WORK. Philip Levy's activities before the Foreign Claims Settlement
       Commission of the United States are widely regarded as significant and beneficial both for
       the clients whom he represented and for the Commission itself. He was counsel in almost all
       the programs of the Commission, commencing in 1949 with the first claims program against the
       Government of Yugoslavia. Exacting, precedent making work was done by Mr. Levy alone, and
       claims work occupied most of the last two decades of his life and represented his flowering
       as a mature legal thinker. </event>
            <event>Two acts of Congress, the War Claims Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1240) and the International
       Claims Settlement Act of 1949, was amended (64 Stat. 12) and Reorganization Plan 1 of 1954
       (68 Stat. 1279) form the basis of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United
       States. This three-member Commission has jurisdiction to determine claims of United States
       nationals against foreign governments for compensation for losses and injuries sustained by
       them. Available funds have their sources in international settlements, liquidation of foreign
       assets in this country by the Departments of Justice or the Treasury, and from public funds
       when provided by Congress. These programs were conducted from 1949 to 1954 by the
       International Claims Commission and since 1954 by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. </event>
            <event>Mr. Levy's claims work has been praised by Mr. Svonko Rode, senior review attorney at
       the Claims Commission, in these words: "In claims programs, such as against the Governments
       of Bulgaria, Rumania, Italy, Hungary, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Cuba, and
       in the war damage program which encompassed war losses sustained by American companies and
       individuals in Albania, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Latvia,
       Lithuania, Poland and Yugoslavia, Philip Levy was representing substantial claims of American
       industrial enterprises. His views and opinions on numerous questions in the field of
       international law were always held in high regard, and in many instances influenced the final
       determination made by the Commission. He was also known as a very precise and accurate
       worker, giving a high degree of attention to minute details in the preparation of his
       statements. briefs and arguments that he used to deliver before the Commission. In the field
       of international claims the late Philip Levy was one of the leaders in the professional
       community, and among the representatives appearing before the Foreign Claims Settlement
       Commission, his name will always be associated with the most outstanding attorneys who
       entered their appearance before that agency." [Statement of Svonko Rode, Esq., March, 1971.]

          <event>LABOR LAW. Mr. Levy held a steady interest in the development of national labor policy.
      For many years he was a teacher of labor law as a Lecturer at American University Law School
      in Washington, D. C. He followed Congressional policy closely. Presidents Truman and
      Eisenhower named him a member of the National Emergency Board of Inquiry, under the
      Taft-Hartley Act, to deal with the American Locomotive Company dispute in 1952-53. Mr. Levy
      was also a member of the National Panel of Arbitrators of the American Arbitration
      Association.</event>
