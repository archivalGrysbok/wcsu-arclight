      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Wesleyan University began offering classes about women's issues in the early 1970s, which was shortly after the first women were admitted to Wesleyan in 1968. Women's Studies was housed within the American Studies program for the duration of the 1970s. In 1980, a Women's Studies Program was formed, but it did not become an official major until 1989.</p>
      <p>The name of the program was changed to <emph render="doublequote">Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies</emph> in 2006 to better reflect the changing nature of the curriculum.</p>
