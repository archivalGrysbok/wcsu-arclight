    <bioghist><head>Historical Note</head><p>In spring 1974, Professor Stephen Dyson of the Classics Department took his Introduction to Archaeology Class on a preliminary excavation in Lyman Orchards in Middlefield, Connecticut. This was a test to see if there was potential for an archaeology class based on fieldwork. The excavation was successful and archaeology classes continued to visit sites in Connecticut, particularly within Middlesex County.</p> 

<p>The first time Wesleyan did a European excavation was in 1969 when it joined with Brown University in Buccino, Italy to excavate Roman villas. Later, in 1974, Dyson took a group of students to the town of Cosa, Italy for a dig. In 1982, Professor Stephen White of history and medieval studies and Clark Maines of art history coordinated with Dyson to take a Wesleyan crew to Soissons in France to study the Augustinian abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes. These trips occurred during the summer and often times they would return for several consecutive summers.</p><p>As of 2008, the archaeology program continues conduct excavation labs within Middlesex county. </p><!-- use "Chronlist Tags" here if there is a chronology --></bioghist>

    <scopecontent><head>Collection Overview</head><p>This Middlesex County Archaeological Digs Records were compiled by Stephen Dyson. They document his archaeology labs conducted in the field and courses focusing on local Connecticut sites. It includes student essays, student field sheets, student lab inventories, grant proposals, Connecticut Historical Commission Inventory sheets for sites in the Middlesex area, and photos of mid-19th century topographic and housing maps of the towns of Middletown, Middlefield, and Cromwell, Connecticut. </p><p>There is a 1977 report written by Stephen Dyson (Box 1, Folder 10) which reviews the findings and the importance of the class after their first three years. He wrote about the Magill House, their second site of excavation, and the conclusions that were made about the wealthy Captain Magill of the 19th century. After their third excavation at Kelly's Pet Store, formerly known as Doc Hall's House, he was able to compare the different life styles of the two families. The Hall House residents lived a more reserved life and preferred the pipe over drink. The class concluded that the Magill House was full of luxuries through analysis of pottery found during the excavation. Dyson wrote that, with the success of his class excavating the Middlesex County area, it would soon include the community and start a program with children from the community.</p>
