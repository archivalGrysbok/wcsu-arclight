      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>Stephen Henry Olinwas born in 1847 on the Wesleyan University campus
                while his father, Stephen Olin, served as its second president. Olin compiled this scrapbook
                when he was 13 years old, presumably as an admirer of the <emph render="doublequote">Gallant Seventh.</emph></p>
      <p>After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1866, Olin graduated from the Law School
                of the University of Albany and began practicing as a lawyer in 1869. His law
                practice centered on issues of copyright and trademark, particularly in literary
                publications. Olin was a trustee of Wesleyan University from 1880 to 1925, and
                in 1922 he also served as acting president of the university.</p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Stephen Henry Olin Regimental Scrapbook consists of two sections. The first
                begins with a hand-painted title page and dedication page, and then continues with
                about 15 pages of newspaper clippings detailing the travels of the 7th Regiment of the New York Militia in
                1860. The second section begins after a number of blank pages and consists of
                humorous newspaper clippings including puns and moral stories. In the middle of the
                second section are two more hand-painted pages, these dedicated to the New York Fire
                Department.</p>
      <p>This scrapbook predates the start of the war, and instead details much lighter
                subject matter. The first portion of the book consists entirely of newspaper and
                magazine clippings (many from <title render="italic">Vanity Fair</title>) detailing
                a trip that the 7th Regiment made to Washington D.C. in February 1860. Specifically,
                the trip was made to attend the inauguration of a new statue of George Washington.
                The Regiment was apparently extended the invitation by the Honorable John Cochrane,
                who made promises of great hospitality. Many of the clippings in this scrapbook are
                of a cartoonish nature, and show the 7th Regiment facing misfortunes and snubs--
                first being stood up at the station after a long train ride, then wading through
                feet of mud in the streets, and finally finding that their host had left the city.
                There are also articles about the inauguration ceremony itself, as well as a copy of
                an order sent to the 7th Regiment by Colonel Marshall Lefferts before the trip, but
                mostly the material laments the <emph render="doublequote">hardships</emph> of the
                regiment in a rather tongue-in-cheek manner. </p>
