      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The EQV freshman rushing booklet of 1961 states: <emph render="doublequote">. . . In
                    rushing we are not hindered by any discriminatory provision; rather our
                    criterion for selection is based upon obtaining in EQV a diversity of
                    personalities, talents, and interests.</emph></p>
      <p>The Wesleyan fraternity EQV was formed in September 1959 when Wesleyan's Phi Gamma
                chapter of Alpha Chi Rho (AXP) voted to withdraw from their national organization.
                This move was the result of discrepancies between AXP's exoteric, or external
                manual, and its esoteric manual, describing the oaths to be taken by pledges during
                their initiation. AXP had been founded in 1895 as a Christian fraternity. In 1954
                the national organization changed the language of the exoteric manual from <emph render="doublequote">. . . membership from among Christians only</emph> to a
                requirement that <emph render="doublequote">members respect Jesus of Nazareth as
                    their moral exemplar.</emph> The esoteric manual, however, kept the original
                language. For that reason, members of Wesleyan's Phi Gamma chapter chose to withdraw
                from the national organization. EQV stands for Esse Quam Videri, which is Latin for
                    <emph render="doublequote">to be, rather than to seem.</emph>
            </p>
      <p>EQV was supported by many Phi Gamma alumni who voted to change the by-laws to allow
                Wesleyan to lease, and eventually own the AXP building at 300 High St. EQV remained
                there until the fall of 1965. By this time, AXP had successfully petitioned the
                administration to return to campus and reclaim their house. EQV now needed a new
                home. For the 1965-1966 year, they lived in the dormitories on Lawn Avenue, and in
                September 1966 they moved into the John Wesley House at 343 High Street. The group
                may have lost momentum following a house fire in early December 1967. EQV disbanded
                in the spring of 1968. </p>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>This collection contains two series representing donations by two EQV members. The
                first series is composed of original materials such as account books, tax forms,
                correspondence and newsletters. Much of this series is from 1967. This series also
                contains group photographs of members for the years 1960, 1966, and 1967. Series II
                is composed of secondary sources including a history of the fraternity, biographies
                of some members, and a directory. Appendices to the history have photocopies of
                original documents that are represented in Series I.</p>
