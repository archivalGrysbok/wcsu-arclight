    <bioghist><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Do Gieng Ciu, a member of the Wesleyan Class of 1916, was born on February 11, 1888 in Foochow, China. Dr. Ciu is probably the best known of the Chinese students who attended the Anglo-Chinese College in Foochow then came to Wesleyan to study. It appears that sometime between his junior and senior years at Wesleyan, Ciu changed his name to Womin Chou. He is listed under Ciu in the annual Catalogs of students as attending Wesleyan for the years 1913/14 (sophomore) and 1914/15 (junior). In the Catalog for his senior year, 1915/16, he is listed as Womin Chou. This change of name also appears on his student record in the Registrar’s files. There is no Ciu in the 1917 Olla Podrida. There is, however, the name and picture of Donald Grove (Womin) Chou. The Olla Podrida notes that Chou was a member of the Chinese Student Union. Regardless of the change of name, Wesleyan sources use the name of Do Gieng Ciu.</p>     

 

<p>After receiving his Bachelor of Science from Wesleyan, Ciu went on to earn a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Drew Theological Seminary in 1919; a Master of Arts from Columbia in 1920; and a Doctor of Pedagogy from New York University in 1921.</p><p>Although Ciu studied chemistry, political science and teaching, when he returned to his native country of China, he chose to be a missionary. He accepted an appointment in the city of Kutien and began his missionary work there in February 1921. There he started six preaching bands to work in the six city wards, in the city prison, and among the soldiers.  He preached nightly. He set up a night school with 47 members, and a boys club with 23 members. Two nights a week, he lectured on hygiene, church history, or doctrine. Ciu became known as <title render="doublequote">The flaming evangel of Kutien.</title> </p><p>While traveling to Kuliang, a summer resort near Foochow, Ciu was killed by bandits on August 20, 1921.  A memorial service was held at Wesleyan on March 5, 1922. The principle speaker was Ralph Ward, Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church and Ciu’s teacher at Anglo-Chinese College in Foochow, China.</p><!-- use "Chronlist Tags" here if there is a chronology --></bioghist>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The collection consists of three items. Two are photographs taken of Do Gieng Ciu in graduation dress wearing a cap and gown, and holding a rolled diploma. In one photograph, the word Wesleyan can be seen written on the diploma along with Ciu’s name. The third item is a map of Kutien with a photo inset of Ciu in graduation cap and gown. The map has the following information handwritten on it: <emph render="doublequote">Map of Kutien, Foochow Dist., China  Drawn by D. G. Ciu, Aug 13, 1921 Copy, illustrating Dr. Cius plan for the development of Kutien.</emph> Barry Scott credits the drawing to Ida Keigwin who was a friend and teacher in Ciu’s time.
