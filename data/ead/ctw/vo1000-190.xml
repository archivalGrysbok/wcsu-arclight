      <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
      <p> In 1927, The Voluntary Committee of Lawyers, Inc. was organized by a group of young
				New York lawyers who felt that the national prohibition law was both unjust and
				unenforceable. Its leaders were Joseph H. Choate, Jr., who served as chairman of the
				Executive Committee, and Harrison Tweed, Treasurer. The organization existed to
				organize like-minded associates, take opinion polls of lawyers across the country,
				issue bulletins and annual reports reciting arguments against the Eighteenth
				Amendment to the Constitution, and work closely with the Association Against the
				Prohibition Amendment. They stressed that a Repeal Amendment should provide for
				ratification by state convention and then proceeded to prepare and place before all
				state governors in February 1933 draft bills providing for election at large of all
				delegates. The alertness and prestige of the members of the Voluntary Committee of
				Lawyers contributed to the fact that most states enacted the model convention bill
				verbatim. When the Twenty-First Amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933, the
				Voluntary Committee of Lawyers disbanded. </p>
      <p>JOSEPH H. CHOATE, JR. was the acknowledged leader and moving force in the Voluntary
				Committee of Lawyers, Incorporated. His interest in this subject was preceded by an
				association during World War I and the 1920s with the chemical section of the Alien
				Property Custodians Bureau where he came to know A. Mitchell Palmer, also later to
				be active in the repeal movement. Upon ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment in
				1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Choate, a Republican, chairman of the
				Federal Alcohol Control Administration. He served in this position for two years. </p>
      <p>He was born in New York February 2, 1876. His father was Joseph H. Choate, a famous
				lawyer and Ambassador to England from 1899 to 1905. Joseph H. Choate, Jr. graduated
				from Harvard College in 1897 and from Harvard Law School. At his death in 1968, at
				age 91, he was counsel in Choate, Regan, Davis and Hollister in the Graybar Building
				in Manhattan. He had residences at 950 Park Avenue, New York, in Mount Kisco, and in
				North Haven, Maine. [See <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, January 20,
				1968, p. 29.]</p>
      <p>HARRISON TWEED served as treasurer of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers and did so
				in the spirit of civic interest that marked many other of his activities. The task
				was done with easy dispatch but with gusto as one of a string of similar public
				activities he believed should concern lawyers. While he was one of the country's
				best known and most successful lawyers, Tweed worked for years in the legal aid
				movement to extend legal services to the poor and underprivileged. In 1963 he joined
				Bernard Segal of Philadelphia as co-chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil
				Rights Under Law, formed at the invitation of President John F. Kennedy at a White
				House meeting. Tweed served as president of the Association of the Bar of the City
				of New York from 1945 to 1948 and was also president at different times of the
				American Law Institute and of the National Legal Aid Association. </p>
      <p>Tweed was born in New York on October 18, 1885 of New England ancestry, not related
				to William Marcy Tweed, the Boss of Tammany Hall in the l870s. Tweed's father,
				Charles Harrison Tweed, was general counsel to prominent railroads while his mother,
				Helen Minerva Evarts, was the daughter of William M. Evarts who was successively
				Attorney General, Secretary of State and a United States Senator between 1868 and
				1891. Tweed was himself little interested in genealogy. He graduated from Harvard in
				1907 and the Harvard Law School in 1910. At the end of his career he was a partner
				in Milbank, Tweed, Fadley &amp; McCloy at One Manhattan Chase Plaza. His home
				was at 10 Gracie Square. Tweed died on June 16, 1969 at the age of 83. [See <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, June 18, 1969, p. 41.] </p>

          <date>1851-1917 </date>
          <event>THE TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT. The evolution of prohibition covers the entire
						sweep of American history beginning with colonial settlement in the 17th
						century. The clergy, the educated, and other members of the Eastern elite at
						first practiced and advocated temperance. Over several generations and as a
						part of the movement West and the democratization of elite values,
						temperance came to hold an appeal for the middle and lower classes. By the
						second third of the 19th century temperance was a widely enough shared value
						in the United States that organized advocates sought to outlaw alcoholic
						beverages. Statewide prohibition came first in the State of Maine in 1851
						through the leadership of Neal Dow of Portland, later a candidate for
						President on the Prohibition Party ticket. The Woman's Christian Temperance
						Union (WCTU) led by Frances Willard was the most prominent of many 19th
						century organizations which sought state prohibition or, at least, local
						option laws, of which many were enacted by the turn of the century. [The
						best intellectual account is Joseph R. Gusfield, <title render="italic">Symbolic Crusade</title> (Urbana and London: University of Illinois
						Press, 1966).] </event>

        <chronitem>
          <date>1893-1933 </date>
          <event>THE ANTI-SALOON LEAGUE OF AMERICA. A more militant organization that was
						prohibitionist in spirit was founded at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio in
						1893 called the Anti-Saloon League. After forming chapters in most
						communities in the state, led mainly by Baptists and Methodists, Ohio became
						a model for similar organizations throughout the country. With a mass
						following, well-financed, closely related to fundamentalist churches, with
						full-time staffs and dynamic leaders, the Anti-Saloon League's work
						exemplified skilled lobbying and had the services of zealous and able
						lawyers like Wayne B. Wheeler. An increasing number of states went dry by
						voting in prohibition laws. In 1913 the Anti-Saloon League of America voted
						to seek national prohibition through a constitutional amendment. With wide
						popular support, especially from among the leading Progressive politicians
						of the day, and by persisting, Congress was persuaded to submit a
						prohibition amendment on December 18, 1917. Ratification was completed on
						January 16, 1919. The amendment took effect one year later. [For an
						exposition of the view that the appeal of prohibition "lay largely with the
						oldstock, middle class section of the American community" which
						"constituted the backbone of the Progressive Movement," see James H.
						Timberlake, <title render="italic">Prohibition and the Progressive Movement
							1900-1920</title> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1963), pp. 2-3.]
						The Anti-Saloon League continued on to help draft the Volstead Act and to
						administer national prohibition, and began only after Wheeler's death in
						1927 to decline. [For a contemporary, muckraking account by a political
						scientist, see Peter Odegard, <title render="italic">Pressure
							Politics</title> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1928). For a view
						stressing litigation and court enforcement by the Anti-Saloon League, see
						Clement E. Vose, <title render="italic">Constitutional Change: Amendment
							Politics and Supreme Court Litigation Since 1900</title> (Lexington,
						Mass.: Lexington Books, 1972), chapter 4, pp. 69-100.] </event>

            <event>THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT. The National Prohibition Amendment was
							ratified on January 16, 1919 and took effect on January 16, 1920. Its
							three sections read as follows: </event>
            <event>Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the
							manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the
							importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United
							States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for
							beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. </event>
            <event>Section 2. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent
							power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. </event>
            <event>Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have
							been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of
							the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years
							from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the

        <chronitem>
          <date>1920-1933</date>
          <event>ASSOCIATION AGAINST THE PROHIBITION AMENDMENT. There had always been
						opposition to laws banning the sale of alcohol and the most important single
						voluntary association to enlist in the campaign for the repeal of the
						Eighteenth Amendment was officially formed on December 31, 1920. The
						organization called the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment had
						been advocated as early as November 12, 1918 by Navy Captain William H.
						Stayton. By the mid-1920s, a group of wealthy businessmen who had earlier
						thought the Amendment might be beneficent joined the AAPA because they were
						alarmed "over the rising crime rate, the violence of the enforcement effort,
						the growth of federal power, and the perceived threat to constitutional
						liberties." They included Pierre and Irenee du Pont, John J. Raskob, James
						W. Wadsworth and later, Jouett Shouse. By publicity, state organization and
						attention to lobbying Congress, the AAPA was always in the forefront of the
						campaign to see a repeal amendment proposed by Congress. Their success came
						when a repeal amendment was proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933. [For
						the best account of the arguments against national prohibition by amendment
						and of the organized activities of the AAPA, see David E. Kyvig, "In Revolt
						Against Prohibition: The Association Against the Prohibition Amendment and
						the Movement for Repeal, 1919-1933" (Ph.D. dissertation, Northwestern
						University, 1971).]</event>
        </chronitem>
        <chronitem>
          <date>1927-1933</date>
          <event>VOLUNTARY COMMITTEE OF LAWYERS, INC. In 1927 some young New York City
						lawyers who believed national prohibition to be wrong and unenforceable
						public policy formally established a single-purpose organization called the
						Voluntary Committee of Lawyers. In the lead were Joseph H. Choate, Jr., who
						served as chairman of the Executive Committee, and Harrison Tweed,
						Treasurer. As lawyers they believed the Eighteenth Amendment to be
						illegitimate as well as unwise policy. They organized associates in every
						state, took polls on the opinions of city lawyers across the country, issued
						bulletins and annual reports reciting arguments against the Eighteenth
						Amendment and worked closely with the Association Against the Prohibition
						Amendment. The papers of Choate and Tweed in the Collection on Legal Change
						today show that the most important contribution of the VCL was in the
						ratification process. They stressed that a Repeal Amendment should provide
						for ratification by state convention and then proceeded to prepare and place
						before all state governors in February 1933 draft bills providing for
						election at large of all delegates. The alertness and the prestige of the
						members of the Voluntary Committee of Lawyers contributed to the fact that
						most states enacted the model convention bill verbatim. This helps to
						account for the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5,
						1933. The VCL then closed its books. [For an account based on these papers
						see the chapter entitled "Lawyers for Repeal," in Clement E. Vose, <title render="italic">Constitutional Change</title>, chapter 5, pp.
						101-138.]</event>
