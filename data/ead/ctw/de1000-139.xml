    <bioghist><head>Historical Note</head><p>Der Deutsche Verein, or The German Club, was a student organization at Wesleyan whose purpose was to promote the learning and application of the German language. The members were students with a high level of German, generally past the second level or higher. Membership was limited to 25 members at a time, and members were required to be highly active and pay dues. They held elections and elected officers for various posts including president, vice-president, and secretary. They held regular meetings on the first and third Saturday of every month of the school year around 7:00 pm.</p> 
<p>Their gatherings (Sitzungen) frequently included meals, and very often they were accompanied by faculty and students reading essays, stories, and poems written in German, of all academic subjects, and pertaining to German Studies, such as travels in Germany, and post-war era topics. They also held a yearly Christmas party (Weihnachtsfest) on December 8 with a large feast, gifts, singing, and readings of verses and poetry.

    <scopecontent><head>Collection Overview</head><p>Almost the entire collection is in German, except for two documents.</p> 
<p>The collection contains two secretary's books, covering the years 1909-1920 and 1946-1955, with the minutes and protocols from the meetings, the group's constitution, and various mementos from the given dates. Photos and invitations to the group's theater performance in 1910 are also included. The folder with miscellaneous documents from 1931 to 1938 contains a program for another play put on in 1930, and an invitation to the Christmas party in 1938. Of particular interest is a short story dated 1934 by T.M. Campbell about an American who wakes in the forest to stumble upon the cottage of Goethe, and has a somewhat mystical encounter with him where the famous writer reveals some of his writing genius.</p> 
<p>Finally, there are two folders dedicated to the Golden Anniversary of the club in 1960. One folder contains the speeches of L.E. Gemeinhardt and Sten Flygt given in English, and almost 80 telegrams and letters from former members on the occasion in both German and English. The guest book from the occasion is also included.</p>
