				served as a member of the Connecticut State Assembly, Connecticut State Legislature,
				and had two terms in the United States Congress as a representative for Connecticut.
				He served in the Army in both World War I and World War II. Citron was an outspoken
				opponent of anti-semitism and, in 1935, wrote to the U.S. Olympic Committee to urge
				that American athletes boycott the Olympics scheduled to take place in Berlin in the

            <event>CONNECTICUT STATE ASSEMBLY. Citron was nominated by the Democratic
							Party as its candidate to the State House of Representatives in 1924,
							1926 and 1930. He was elected on the second and third occasions and thus
							was a member of the Assembly during the 1927-1928 and 1931-1932
							sessions, serving as minority leader during both sessions. [On
							Connecticut political life during these years and later, see Duane
							Lockard, <title render="italic">New England State Politics</title>
							(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959), pp. 228-304.] </event>
            <event>RECORD IN STATE LEGISLATURE: FIRST TERM. During his first term,
							Citron was one of 25 Democrats among 237 Republicans in the Republican
							administration of Governor John H. Trumbull. A member of the Committees
							on Military Affairs, Rules, and the Sale of Lands, he introduced one
							resolution and 18 bills, including ones to require proof of financial
							responsibility of owners of motor vehicles in case of an accident (HE
							70), to increase benefits for dependent children under the Workmen's
							Compensation Act (HE 202). to exempt voters in state elections from
							payment of a personal tax for the year (HB 660), and to require approval
							of all rate increases by public service corporations (HE 712). All of
							these were rejected owing in part to the Appropriations Committee's
							"rate of slaughter" for proposed bills. Apparently, their war cry was
							"Cut, cut, cut for Connecticut!" (<title render="italic">Middletown
								Press</title>, March 12, 1927, p. 1), for it was felt "the 1927
							session of the state legislature probably [would] create a new record
							for minimum number of laws placed on the statute books... " (<title render="italic">Middletown Press</title>, April 9, 1927, p. 1). </event>
            <event>RECORD IN STATE LEGISLATURE: SECOND TERM. As a result of the 1930
							election, Citron became one of the 85 Democrats among only 182
							Republicans in the Democratic administration of Governor Wilbur L.
							Cross. He served again on the Rules and Military Affairs Committees, and
							also was a member of the Committee on Forfeited Rights. He introduced 7
							bills, 6 resolutions, and one petition. He called for the repeal of
							Prohibition (HJR 111), an amendment to the State Constitution requiring
							a two-thirds vote to override a Governor's veto (HR 25), and creation of
							a city planning commission in Middletown (HB 362). </event>

							Congress in 1928, 1932, 1934, 1936, 1938 and 1952. He was elected as an
							at-large candidate in 1934 and 1936 and served in Congress from January
							3, 1935 to January 3, 1939. A member of the Judiciary Committee, Citron
							was decidedly a Roosevelt or New Deal Democrat who initiated and
							supported measures to regulate business, to control utilities, and to
							regulate the Connecticut River. Among the measures he supported were the
							Reconstruction Finance Corporation Extension Act, the National
							Industrial Recovery Extension Act, the Work Relief and Public Works
							Appropriation Act of 1938, and the Social Security Act. He also voted
							for the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Fair Labor Standards Act of
							1938. </event>
            <event>RECORD IN CONGRESS: FIRST TERM. During his first term in 1935-1936,
							Congressman Citron introduced a total of 19 bills and resolutions,

							7508), to create a commission to make a study of the textile industry
							(HR-672l), to authorize the President to loan $25 million for flood

							employing convicts or persons under 16 (HR 12582), to amend the U.S.
							Constitution to give the President line-item veto power (HJR 552), and
							to permit an income tax on securities (HJR 576). </event>
            <event>RECORD IN CONGRESS: SECOND TERM. Upon reelection, Citron in 1937-1938
							introduced, among others, bills to protect individuals from lynching (HR
							4181), to make the Civilian Conservation Corps a permanent agency (HR
							4481), to authorize commemorative stamps to honor Kosciusko and
							Krzyzanowski (RJR 189, HJR 187), to construct Coast Guard ice breakers,
							one for New London (HR 4653), and later to investigate price fixing of

						Olympic Committee to urge that American athletes boycott the Olympics

						remarks printed in the <title render="italic">Congressional Record</title>,
						pointing out that the Nazi government of Germany was simply exploiting this
						event to claim honor in the family of nations and that Nazi racist practices
						would be given tacit approval if the United States fielded a team. Citron's
						objections and those of others were not abided by but his forecast stands in
						the record. [For an account of the politics and the total environment of the

						(TVA). On April 17, the New England Regional Planning Commission voted down
						the CVA proposal in favor of the interstate compact method of developing
						water resources. On February 16, 1937 he reintroduced a CVA bill (HR 4811)
						modified to include a ten-member advisory commission made up of local

        <emph render="underline">The Connecticut River--William M. Citron's
					Contribution</emph>
      </p>
      <p>CONNECTICUT RIVER: A natural resource of immense significance to the region, subject
				to spring flooding, the Connecticut River held an abiding fascination for William
				Citron. He grew up on its banks in Middletown and formed an early attachment to the
				river and an interest in its regulation for the public good. The Connecticut River
				flows from the Canadian border in New Hampshire 410 miles through Vermont,
				Massachusetts, and Connecticut to Long Island Sound, dropping 2200 feet from its
				upper reaches to the ocean. The development of water power led to the
				industrialization of such cities as Holyoke and Springfield, Massachusetts. The
				Connecticut's navigability to Hartford made that city and Middletown important
				seaports from colonial times, with the quarries in Portland, across from Middletown,
				producing the brownstone for the famous apartment buildings of New York's post-Civil
				War years. [See Evan Hill, <title render="italic">The Connecticut River</title>,
				with photographs by William F. Stekl, introduction by Roger Tory Peterson, and
				foreword by Abraham Ribicoff. (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press,
				1972.)]</p>
      <p>SOURCES OF POLITICAL CONFLICT IN THE CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY: Private development of
				power on the Connecticut River was the rule. Federal action in the movement for the
				regulation of utilities or the direct development of public power was resisted under
				the cloak of <emph render="doublequote">states rights.</emph> The issue of flood
				control was also important in the political life of these states, especially
				Connecticut, and individual political figures like Citron were drawn into unending
				disputes about numerous imponderables. One careful student of the subject concluded
				that <emph render="doublequote">the disputes, as they took shape, reflected the
					political configurations and moral attitudes of the major contesting interest
					groups in the era of Franklin Roosevelt. The question of federal-state conflict
					in the Connecticut Valley is a microcosm of the political struggles of the
					period. [Leuchtenburg, <title render="italic">Flood Control Politics</title>, p.
					1]</emph></p>
      <p>NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY. Politics may not explain the time
				of acts of God but natural disasters do have political consequences. Three such
				devastations visited the Connecticut Valley between 1927 and 1938, years coinciding
				with Citron's emerging prominence, as follows:</p>
      <p>(1) The New England flood of November 1927 resulted from a collision of a cold,
				western stormbank with moist southern winds. Torrential rain fell over all of
				Vermont, and western Massachusetts and Connecticut, November 2-4, followed by
				near-zero temperatures the following week. The resulting flood left thousands
				homeless, took hundreds of lives, destroyed numerous bridges, and aroused great
				citizen interest in flood control needs. <emph render="doublequote">In much of the
					Connecticut Valley, the floodwaters reached their greatest height in three
					centuries. The November 1927 flood was incomparably more destructive than any
					previous flood in the history of New England.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 29.] The
				chief response to the 1927 disaster was to ignore interstate action and to urge that
				private power companies develop a system of storage reservoirs for peaks on the
				river. The years passed with insufficient action to achieve a bare minimum of flood
				protection. But as Leuchtenburg points out, a flood of the magnitude of 1927 was not
				to be expected for another century.</p>
      <p>(2) The Connecticut River Valley was flooded even more severely than 1927 between
				March 12 and 26, 1936. Industrial life came to a stand-still. By March 22 Hartford
				was in a virtual state of siege. [Leuchtenburg, p. 47] There was devastation from
				northern Vermont to Long Island Sound. <emph render="doublequote">The flood was a
					major disaster for the Connecticut Valley, by far the worst in memory . . . It
					cost at least sixty million dollars at a time when the valley was only slowly
					recovering from the great depression. The New England floods took twenty-four
					lives and left 77,000 homeless.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 48.] Previously buried,
				Citron's August 1935 proposal, H.J. Res. 377, to enable the drafting of interstate
				compacts, was revived in April 1936. </p>
      <p>(3) On September 21, 1938, following four days of rain, a tropical hurricane of major
				dimensions struck New England and left devastation that clearly surpassed that
				wrought by the great floods of 1927 and 1936. The storm's center hit just west of
				New Haven and passed up the Connecticut River Valley to Canada, and yet
				counter-cyclonical winds of 110 miles an hour were felt in Providence and Boston.
				The hurricane struck when the tides were higher than normal. The wind blew down and
				damaged 250 million trees, including some 20 percent of the maple sugar trees of
				Vermont. Hundreds of trees on the Wesleyan campus in Middletown were felled. Damage
				to crops of all kinds was extreme, 488 lives were lost and property damage was
				incalculable throughout New England. One assessment, possibly excessive but worth
				bearing in mind was this: <emph render="doublequote">The property damage was the
					greatest in any disaster in American History, worse than the San Francisco
					earthquake or the Chicago fire.</emph> [Leuchtenburg, p. 113.]</p>
      <p>CONNECTICUT RIVER VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL COMPACT</p>
      <p>Among the means explored to govern problems created by the untamed Connecticut River
				was the <emph render="doublequote">interstate compact</emph> idea suggested in the
				United States Constitution, Article I, section 10, providing: <emph render="doublequote">No State shall, without the consent of Congress . . . enter
					into any agreement or compact with another State.</emph> After much study, Mr.
				Citron on August 13, 1935, introduced a Joint Resolution to enable the six New
				England States and New York, <emph render="doublequote">or any two or more of them,
					to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts for conserving and regulating
					the flow, lessening flood damage, making other public improvements on any rivers
					or streams whose drainage basins lie within any two or more of the said
					States.</emph> (H. J. Res. 377, 74th Cong., 1st sess.) The bill was referred to
				the House Judiciary Committee, where it lay until April 1936. At that time debate on
				the so-called Copeland bill, designed to require local contributions for federal
				flood control efforts, led Congressmen to look at other alternatives, including
				Citron's bill. Hearings were held in April at which Citron stated that he thought
				New Englanders preferred the home rule flood control option to the federal
				intervention as in the TVA. [Leuchtenburg, p. 50.] The bill was favorably reported
				by the Committee, passed, and was signed into law on June 8, 1936. Shortly
				thereafter, President Roosevelt signed into law the Omnibus Flood Control Act of
				1936 (the Copeland Act) [Leuchtenburg, p. 51], which provided some funds for flood
				control projects on the Connecticut and also authorized creation of interstate
				compacts in New England for the purpose of determining and distributing costs of
				land purchases, rights of way, and construction of dams among the states
				involved.</p>
      <p>When the New England Joint Commission on Interstate Compacts for Flood Control met in
				Boston that year, delegates from Vermont and New Hampshire made it clear that they
				were not about to flood good land for the benefit of those downstream, namely
				Connecticut and Massachusetts. Nevertheless, upon urging from a representative of
				President Roosevelt, the states came up with a completed draft for a flood control
				compact. It called for creation of a Flood Control Commission to distribute the
				costs of acquiring land according to the following ratios: Massachusetts, 50 per
				cent; Connecticut, 40 per cent; Vermont, 5 per cent; and New Hampshire, 5 per
				cent.</p>
      <p>One provision of the proposed compact caused considerable opposition by the Roosevelt
				Administration in Washington. Article 8 provided that the states in which the dams
				were constructed would have exclusive rights of water conservation, power storage,
				or power development provided by each reservoir site. The Federal Power Commission
				objected to this provision, claiming it violated the Flood Control Act of 1936 and
				the Federal Water Power Act of 1920. Roosevelt himself opposed Congressional
				approval of the New England compact, which forced the issue back in Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Those who opposed the Administration's rejection of the power provision included the
					<title render="italic">Hartford Courant</title> and Governor Wilbur Cross in
				Connecticut, as well as Governor George Aiken of Vermont, Governor Francis Murphy of
				New Hampshire, and the <title render="italic">Boston Transcript</title>. Those who
				supported Roosevelt included Congressmen Citron, Alfred Phillips, and Herman
				Koppelman of Connecticut; Joseph Casey of Massachusetts; and Senator Fred Brown of
				New Hampshire. This support proved disastrous in the 1938 election, only a month and
				a half after the hurricane of September 21. Only Congressman Casey was reelected.
				[Leuchtenburg, p. 119.]</p>
      <p>TVA ON THE CONNECTICUT</p>
      <p>The controversy over the TVA arose from Citron's bill, HR 4979, introduced on January
				29, 1935. Reaction to the idea was mixed. Roosevelt thought that the TVA should be
				studied thoroughly before attempting nationwide implementation. Private utilities in
				New England opposed a Connecticut Valley Authority, and no substantial support for
				the bill ever became evident. As a result, the bill died in committee.</p>
      <p>On February 16, 1937, Citron reintroduced a modified version of the CVA bill (HR
				4811) which would include an advisory commission of representatives from the New
				England states to be recommended by the Governors of those states. This concession
				to home rule, however, did nothing to get the bill past the committee on Flood
				Control.</p>
      <p>FINAL ACTION</p>
      <p>A quick review of action in Congress after the New England compact was submitted for
				approval follows. While the committee hearings were in progress. HR 10618, the
				omnibus flood control bill for 1938, was reported out on May 19. In the course of
				floor debate, Alben Barkley's amendment giving the Federal Government title to dams
				and reservoirs in all Federal flood control programs won Senate approval. Roosevelt
				concurred with this amendment, and the bill passed both houses in June 1938, and was
				signed into law by the President. It was now the Federal Government's turn to
				attempt to solve the massive political and economic flood control problems in New
				England. [For a detailed account, see Leuchtenburg, pp. 110-120.]</p>
      <p>CITRON'S ROLE</p>
      <p>Congressman Citron lost the election of 1938, but had done his part to see that
				Congress had a number of alternatives to direct Federal control of the Connecticut
				River flood program. As a New Deal Democrat, William M. Citron tried to bring the
				successes of the Federal Government in other programs into New England through the
				TVA idea. New England sentiment, however, was in favor of local authority for
				solving the problems of the Connecticut River Valley. His first bill enabling the
				New England states to form a compact stood as the foundation for the eventual
				agreement among those states that they must act independently of the Federal
				Government to get action. While approval of their compact agreement was held up in
				Congress, Roosevelt's program was passed. Meanwhile, the hurricane of 1938 struck.
				It is interesting to note that the New England Flood Control Commission was finally
				formed and approved by all the participating states by the summer of 1951.
				[Leuchtenburg, p. 211.] After sixteen years in the works, a system was operational.
				Political change may not come in time to prevent acts of God, but natural disasters
				do have significant political consequences.</p>
