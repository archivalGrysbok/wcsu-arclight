            <p>Charles Cole was born in Chatham, Connecticut in 1839. He attended Harvard Law
                School, graduating in 1864, and for the next thirty years worked out of his office
                in Hartford. He practiced both constitutional and corporation law and served as
                attorney for a variety of businesses in Hartford and other parts of Connecticut. He
                was also involved in the Republican Party in Connecticut. He died in August 1895 at
                the age of 56.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection consists primarily of handwritten or typed letters sent to Cole by
                fellow lawyers, businessmen and clients. There are a handful of letters from Cole’s
                siblings but these are mostly about business matters. The materials were donated in
                four file folders spanning the period between 1885 and 1893 and were arranged either
                by first or last name or the name of a company or business. Within each section the
                materials were not arranged alphabetically. The folders were marked 1, 2, 3 and 5
                covered the periods 1885-1887, 1887-1889, 1889-1891 and 1891-1893. Missing from the
                collection is the bulk of the year 1891 (parts of January and December of that year
                are covered) which presumably would have appeared in folder 4. The materials have
                been kept in their original order and further alphabetized.</p>
            <p>Box 1 contains the documents from 1885-1887 and those from 1887-1889 through the
                letter L. Included are letters from J.M. Addis (1887) asking for advice about
                setting up his own real estate office in Bridgeport; James P. Baker (1887) asking
                for money with a note from Cole “Sent check to Baker for $500;” Misses Benedict and

                and asking for a “share of your patronage;” Anna B. Bruther (1886), Cole’s cousin,
                reporting that interest on bank notes has arrived and that father is well; a blank

                about taxes he owes; J. W. Johnson (1886) regarding Pierre Pirout, who was on an

                (1886) asking about the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company, having found Cole’s name
                in Hubbell’s Legal Directory; William Parry (1885) reporting that he has not found
                the home of Miss Mary Taft but has found two other witnesses; and the Vermont Farm
                Machine Company (1885) writing about cans shipped to Cole that have not yet
                arrived.</p>
            <p>Box 2 contains the remainder of documents from 1887-1889, all of 1889-1891 and
                1891-1983 through the letter B. Included are letters from Stephan Ball, Hartford

                Wilkins Micawber;”; Charles H. Noble (1889-1890) saying he cannot pay Cole due to
                his wife’s illness; James Roche (1888) writing about the Hillard Estate; H.C. Speer

                Contractors and Builders (1891) writing to apologize for not getting to Cole’s work

                of the late Charles H. Brainard. Mrs. Fannie Grimes Camp and the Berlin Iron Bridge
                Company are given their own folders. Mrs. Camp wrote to Cole numerous times and
                included are additional letters from Geo. W. Moore amp; Co. about Mrs. Camp’s
                mortgage loans. Included among the documents relating to the Berlin Iron Bridge

                John Carlson, who lost his leg in an accident; and a blank deposition form and
                related court documents.</p>
            <p>Box 3 contains the remainder of the documents from 1891-1893. Included are letters

                father-in-law). C.R. Johns amp; Co. (1892) writing about Mrs. Fannie Grimes Camp not

                given her own folder. It contains several lengthy letters to Cole that often do not
                appear to be about business, although some mention bills </p>
