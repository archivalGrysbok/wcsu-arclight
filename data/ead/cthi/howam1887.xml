      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Mark Howard was born on May 27, 1817 in Maidstone, Kent, England. When he was
                thirteen years old, Howard, his parents, and brother emigrated to Ann Arbor,
                Michigan. Four weeks after their arrival, Howard's father died, leaving instructions
                that his sons were not to return to England. They remained in Ann Arbor under the
                guardianship of Judge Dexter. </p>
      <p>Howard worked in Ann Arbor as a postmaster, newspaper editor, and he involved himself
                in Whig politics. At the age of twenty-six, he became a local agent in Ann Arbor for
                the Protection Insurance Company of Hartford. A few years later, in 1846, Howard
                moved to Hartford to continue his work in insurance. In 1849 he inspired some
                confidence in Protection Insurance when, following the St. Louis fire, he went to
                the city to settle the losses with ready cash. </p>
      <p>When the Connecticut legislature incorporated the Merchants' Insurance Company in
                1857, Howard was asked to become its president. He agreed on the condition that, in
                the case of insurance claims, the company would pay the entire capital in cash. The
                company flourished until 1871, when the Chicago conflagration consumed its assets.
                Ten days after the fire, former backers of the Protective and Merchants' insurance
                companies founded the National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford and elected Mark
                Howard as its first president. As president, Howard advanced the idea that full
                insurance led to indifference and carelessness. He argued that if the insurance
                company paid three quarters of the loss, insurance rates would be lower insurance
                rates and loss less due to some risk being felt by the insured.</p>
      <p>In addition to his work in insurance, Howard was active in politics and indeed was
                one of the founders of the Republican Party. He organized a system for collections,
                and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln to be Connecticut's first internal revenue
                collector. Howard also made considerable profits in western land deals. From the
                years 1853 to 1856 alone there are in this collection 103 Military land grants
                issued by the General Land Office in Washington, D.C. </p>
      <p>While still president of the National Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, Howard died
                in his home on January 24, 1887. He was survived by his wife, Angelina Lee Howard,
                and four children. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Collection consists largely of letters written to Mark Howard by various business
                contacts. They cover such topics as stocks, land deals, legal matters, and politics.
                The early correspondence is almost entirely consumed by financial discussion, both
                personal and relating to insurance. Included are several letters from Howard's
                lawyers, Mitchell Eackerand Marcus Osborn. Around 1860, however, there is a change
                to political letters, which can be seen in the many letters from Gideon Welles and
                William Faxon. In those years there is also plenty of military correspondence from
                Marcus Osborn, who was on a ship in the Gulf of Mexico. Howard also kept detailed
                personal records, ranging from savings for his children to interest on his own
                accounts. There are receipts indicating how much he spent on specific items of
                clothing and how much on foodstuffs. Also of interest are two boxes relating to
                Howard's land grants in what are now the Midwestern states, with particular
                attention paid to Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. There are land deeds, and one
                box of military land grants Howard bought from former members of the U.S. military
                from 1853 through 1856. In addition to those mentioned above, notable correspondents
                include Horace Greeley, James Barnard, James Babcock, Horatio Woodman, Joshua
                Phelps, James Dixon, and James Edmonds.</p>

        <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Correspondence</emph> consists of correspondence
                    written by and to Mark Howard. Most has to do with Howard's personal and
                    professional business: stocks, land grants, insurance claims, and lawsuits. Also
                    included are some letters between members of the Howard family.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Receipts, Bills, Accounts, Cheques</emph> consists
                    of highly detailed receipts, bills, accounts, and cheques. Includes item-level
                    receipts for household and personal items such as food and clothing, as well as
                    notes on investments.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series III: Western Real Estate</emph> consists of documents
                    relating to Mark Howard's real estate in what are now the Midwestern states;
                    includes deeds, land grants, diagrams of townships, and military land grants
                    bought by Howard.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series IV: Printed material</emph> consists of broadsides,
                    newspaper clippings, and journal articles collected by Mark Howard; subjects
                    include Whig politics, insurance, and western states and territories.</p>
