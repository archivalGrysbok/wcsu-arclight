            <p>William Francis Joseph Boardman (1828-1912) was the scion of a prosperous and
                influential Connecticut family. His ancestor Samuel Boreman (1615-1678), originally
                of Oxfordshire, England, was one of the early settlers of Wethersfield, Connecticut.
                W.F.J. Boardman's father, William Boardman (1805-1887), founder of the family's
                coffee, tea, and spice business, was a printer, founder and editor of the Norwich
                Republican (1828-1829), state prison director, member of the legislature, banker and
                insurance director, merchant and manufacturer. William Boardman married Mary Francis
                (1803-1884) of Wethersfield and had, besides William Francis Joseph, three children:
                Thomas Jefferson (1832-1858), known as Jeff; Mary Lucinda (1841-1934), known as
                Lizzie; and Emma Jennette (1846-1860).</p>
            <p>W.F.J. Boardman was born on December 12, 1828 in the old Boardman house in
                Wethersfield and received his education in Wethersfield's public schools. In 1846,
                he joined his father's business, and when the business moved to Hartford, he became
                a partner in Boardman and Son. In 1853, his brother Thomas Jefferson also became a
                partner of the business now named Boardman and Sons. The business, located on Asylum
                Avenue, maintained a large-scale wholesale trade in New England and other regions.
                After his health failed, W.F.J. attempted to recuperate during a trip to Europe and
                the southern United States. Unable to fully regain his health, he retired in 1888,
                after forty-two years in business. He died on November 23, 1912 and was buried in
                Hartford's Cedar Hill Cemetery.</p>
            <p>W.F.J. Boardman was very active in the civic affairs of Hartford. He was an original
                member of hte Putnam Phalanx, a military organization of Connecticut. He ws a member
                of the Hartford Common Council, incolved in the highways and railroads of
                Connecticut. In 1862 he was a director of the State Bank of Hartford. He also
                undertook business interests in the Hartford and New York Steamboat Company, the
                Merrick Thread Company of Holyoke, as well as paper and water power companies. He
                was a life member of the Connecticut Historical Society, and a member of the Sons of
                the American Revolution. W.F.J. Boardman conducted intensive genealogical research
                on the Boardman family. In 1895, he published the Boardman Genealogy 1525-1855 and
                the Ancestry of William Francis Joseph Boardman in 1906.</p>
            <p>On January 7, 1852, W.F.J. married Jane Maria Greenleaf (1835-1899), a member of the
                prominent Greenleaf families of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Jane Boardman pursued
                numerous charitable works in Hartford. They resided at 74 Farmington Avenue, in a
                house that contained valuable paintings, furniture, family records and artifacts,
                and a personal library of over 1000 volumes. Their son, William Greenleaf Boardman
                (1853-1908), worked for Boardman and Sons but had to retire from business due to eye
                problems. On October 29, 1874 William married Eliza Root, whose mother was a cousin
                of the poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Their children were Francis Whittier
                (1876-1885), Cedric Root (1886-1960) and Dorothy Root (1889-1945). The family
                resided in Hartford.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The Boardman collection consists of William Francis Joseph's diaries, memoranda and
                account notebooks, a song collection, scrapbooks, and miscellaneous papers and
                clippings. Six of the diaries were kept by Mr. Boardman's mother, Mary Francis
                Boardman. In spite of his economic prosperity and high standing in the community,
                the diaries reveal Mr. Boardman's melancholy turn of mind and his preoccupation with
                his wife's constant illnesses. Throughout his entries, Mr. Boardman details the
                various afflictions in his lungs, kidneys, heart, and bowels, as well as attacks of
                boils and carbuncles. Both he and his wife, Jane, suffered from insomnia and
                nervousness. He often reflects on man's mortality and the approaching loss of his
                parents and contemporaries. He repeatedly mentions his depression in terms of
                "feeling blue" or "used up." This state of mind is in contrast to his appreciation
                of the beloved family circle, his lovely home, and his many civic interests and
                engaged comments on current events in America and abroad. His diaries also contain
                commentary, facts, and statistics on Hartford businesses and the economic
                environment of the state.</p>
