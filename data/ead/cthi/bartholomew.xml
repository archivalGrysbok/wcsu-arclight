            <p>Jacob Bartholomew (1736-1805) married Sarah (Gridley) and after her death in 1801, he
                married Eunice (Cowles). He was the proprietor of Bartlemy Tavern and Store and was
                a tanner by trade. He held several positions in the founding of Bristol,
                Connecticut in 1785. He had five sons live to adulthood: Lemma (1764-1813), Jacob
                (1768-1843), Eli (1774-1801), Asa (1776-1864), and Gad (1783-1851), and was the
                administrator of his nephew Eziekiel Bartholomew’s estate. Lemma successfully ran
                the tavern and store after his father’s death. Jacob married and lived in Bristol,
                while running a general stove and tin business, later moving his family to Ohio.
                Eli was a merchant in Hartford, Connecticut and left his only daughter, Julia, to be raised
                alone by his wife. Julia was considered an heir to her grandfather’s estate since
                her father died early. Asa married Charity (Shelton) in 1801 and after a moving to
                New York to run another tavern, they returned to Bristol where he was a
                successful businessman. They had three sons: George Wells (1805-1897), Harry Shelton
                (1807-1827), and Asa (1815- ?). </p>
            <p>George Wells married Angeline (Grandison) in 1829 and fathered eight children with
                her. After her death he married widow Julia Ann Cole (Marvin) in 1864, who brought
                her daughter Hettie Julia Cole, into the family. Only three of George and Angeline's children
                where still alive. A fourth child to reach adulthood, Jane Estelle
                Russell (1840-1862), died two year previously, but left him several grandchildren. He
                was a respected businessman and held various local government positions as well as
                being a justice of the peace. His sons, Harry Shelton (1832-1902) and George
                Wells Jr. (1848- ?) survived him. Harry Shelton and his father were in the
                manufacturing business together and Harry became the executor of his father’s estate.
                George Wells Jr. was born in Bristol and married his step-sister, Hettie Julia
                Cole. After moving his family to Austin, Texas, he authored the Record of the
                Bartholomew Family in 1885, from which most of this information has been gathered.
                A copy of this book is available in the Connecticut Historical Society’s
                Research Center. </p>
            <p>Jacob Bartholomew’s (1736-1805) cousin Lemuel Bartholomew (1726-1801) purchased several pieces of land in Litchfield County, Connecticut, beginning
                in 1748.
                He moved his family to Skenesboro, New York around 1769. He fathered eight sons. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The bulk of this collection relates to the Bartholomew family, with additional
                material belonging to the Stiles and French families, and records of the towns of
                Bristol, Southbury and Woodbury. The town papers consist of items not readily attributed to a
                particular individual. The papers have been organized into series by family name,
                including a series for assorted families not related to the named families, and a
                series for town records. Within each folder, materials are arranged chronologically. </p>
            <p>The largest section of papers is attributed to Lemma Bartholomew, but a closer look
                into the family shows that his cousin Lemuel has several decedents named Lemma and
                Lemuel. However, due to the information that he moved his family to New York in
                1769, all of the papers are attributed to the two eldest men. Some items may indeed belong to these other family members, but they have yet to
                be discovered. Of note in the Bartholomew family papers is a 1799 liquor license
                allowing Lemma Bartholomew to sell spirits from the store in his house and an
                undated recipe for 40 gallons of Wintergreen Cordial. Also of note in connection to Lemma is a link to two men,
                George Stillman and Charles Morgan, who were active in shipping ventures throughout
                the West Indies. Most of these papers are of a legal nature, listing Stillman and
                Morgan as defendants, and can be found in their individual folders.</p>
            <p>A few of the other interesting documents in this collection provide a look into colonial
                Connecticut. Several pieces in the Assorted Documents series direct payment
                from the colony treasury to John Lord, manager of the Hartford workhouse, and
                payment to individuals for keeping indigent women and children, 1765-1767. </p>
            <p>The Stiles and
                French families resided in Litchfield County. The link between these families
                and the Bartholomew family is unknown, but may have something to do with
                Lemuel's land purchases in Litchfield County. Deeds and land
                surveys may be found in several individual’s folders. Of particular note is Benjamin
                and David Stiles’s account book, which contains a lesson plan for
                teaching methods of surveying in the 1700s. Additionally, there are several
                educational rants of human vices and letters home from Benjamin French while at
                Williams College until 1796. There is also a small notebook that an anonymous author filled
                with thoughts on many academic topics, such as Mathematics, Grammar, and Physics. </p>
            <p>Within the Bristol folder of the Town Records series are records of the North District
                School, which list the student names and various statistics necessary to assess the tax
                owed by their families. Bristol also billed a Mr. Abel
                Lewis for his services for the 1809 Independence Ball. </p>
