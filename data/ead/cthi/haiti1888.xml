      <p>The papers found within the Haiti collection cover Haiti's history from the
                independence struggle of the 1790s until the late 1880s. By the end of the
                eighteenth century, St.-Domingue prospered in large part due to the importation of
                African slaves to work on the plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, and cotton. At
                the start of the French Revolution, Haiti was France's richest colony. But the
                slogans of 'Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité' stirred up the
                passions of several of the poorer classes in the colony, including slaves.</p>
      <p>A key figure in the insurrections of the 1790s was Pierre François Dominique
                Toussaint L'Ouverture, three of whose letters exist in the collection. Toussaint was
                a former slave and proved an effective leader. He joined the French forces in
                Hispaniola and eventually became their commanding general. In 1801 he completed the
                conquest of Santo Domingo and proceeded to abolish slavery and declare himself
                governor general for life. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Toussaint, the French had by this time made peace with Britain and
                the United States and Napoleon Bonaparte sent General Charles Leclerq in 1802 to
                restore French sovereignty. Leclerq captured Toussaint, and he died in a French
                prison in 1803. In the meantime, Toussaint's leading generals, Henri Christophe and
                Jean Jacques Dessalines, had joined Leclerq's forces.</p>
      <p>When it became clear that Napoleon intended to restore slavery in the colony, the top
                black officers defected and joined the insurrectionists. Concerned that Napoleon
                might use St.-Domingue as a point from which to occupy Louisiana, Thomas Jefferson
                supplied arms, munitions, and supplies to the insurrectionists. When Britain went to
                war again with France in 1802, the British Navy prevented Napoleon from sending
                reinforcements to Leclerq's army; in November 1803, the French surrendered, and in
                January 1804 Dessalines declared an independent 'Haiti'. </p>
      <p>The years following independence, however, were far from calm. The first two decades
                were characterized by political strife, and there were continuous economic troubles.
                The United States, Britain, and France made the situation worse by exploiting the
                country politically and economically. Abraham Lincoln's recognition of Haitian
                independence in 1862 did do something to bolster Haitian confidence, but this little
                to solve the dire economic problems. The pattern of power struggles, foreign
                exploitation, and economic distress would continue well beyond the last date
                included in this collection: 1888. </p>
