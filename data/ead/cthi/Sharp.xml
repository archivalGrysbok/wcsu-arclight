            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>Albert F. Sharp was born in Rhode Island about 1831, the son of Charles and Prudence
                Sharp. He enlisted for very short terms in Company G, 10th Regiment, Connecticut
                Volunteers in 1861, and then reenlisted as a Sergeant on 23 September 1861. In June
                1864, he transferred to Company A of the 10th Regiment. It was while fighting with
                this company at Deep Bottom Run, Virginia on 14 August 1864 that he was wounded;
                four days later he died. </p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> Albert Sharp wrote detailed descriptions of his whereabouts and his battlefield
                experiences in 28 letters written home to family and friends from 1863-1864. With
                the 10th Regiment, he was present at the battles of Fredericksburg,
                Chancellorsville, Richmond, and Deep Bottom, Virginia where he died of his wounds. A
                letter dated 13 January 1863 from New Bern, NC, includes a square of velvet he took
                from the Gunboat Fannie. His letter dated 8 May 1864 describes the Battle of the
                Wilderness.</p>
            <p> Transcriptions of these letters follow the originals. Copies of the letters and a
                finding aid for the collection of Albert F. Sharp letters at Auburn University are
                also included. These letters may be quoted from but credit must be given to Auburn
                University. </p>
            <p> Two poems evidently penned by Sharp give testimony to his colorful descriptions and
                poetic nature. They are undated. The titles are “The sword of Bunker Hill” and “The
                Ocean Burial”. </p>
            <p> The next to last folder in this collection contains Sharp’s death certificate, a
                letter from his commanding officer, Major E.S. Greeley informing Sharp’s mother of
                the soldier’s death, and a discharge paper documenting his promotion from Sergeant
                in Company A to Lieutenant in Company G. It also contains a list of veterans of
                Company A, 10th Regiment, and copies of Sharp’s enlistment papers.</p>
            <p> The final folder contains a newspaper article describing the actions of the 10th
                Regiment and the subsequent death of Sharp, written by H.C. Trumbull, Chaplain. A
                letter to Sharp, dated 2 August 1864 from a minister in New Haven requesting money
                for a relatively new church, is the only piece of incoming correspondence. </p>
