      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>John Trumbull was born on June 6, 1756 in Lebanon, Connecticut, the youngest son of
                Jonathan Trumbull, Governor of Connecticut, and Faith Robinson of Duxbury,
                Massachusetts. Trumbull graduated from Harvard College in 1773, and upon returning
                to Lebanon was asked by the State Governor, his father, to prepare maps for
                adjusting land claims in the town of Westmoreland (now in Pennsylvania). This
                experience in land surveying was of importance in his brief duty as second
                aide-de-camp under George Washington in Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>In 1775 Trumbull began his military career as adjutant to the First Regiment of
                Connecticut under General Joseph Spencer; he was appointed major of the brigade in
                Roxbury later that year, a position he held until promoted to deputy
                adjutant-general (with rank of colonel) in General Philip Schuyler's Northern
                Department. At Ticonderoga Trumbull played a significant role in strengthening
                defenses of the "Gibraltar of America." Trumbull left the Continental Army in 1777
                after a dispute over the date of his commission. </p>
      <p>Trumbull returned again to Lebanon to paint; and in 1780 he traveled to London,
                England to study art under Benjamin West. Shortly after his arrival he was arrested
                and placed in jail on charges of treason. He was subsequently released and deported
                from England. </p>
      <p>In 1794 Trumbull returned to England as an American commissioner under the Jay Treaty
                between Great Britain and the United States, and in 1800 Trumbull was married to
                Sarah Hope Harvey. He lived in New Haven from 1804 until 1808, and in England until
                1815, when he came finally to settle in New York City.</p>
      <p>In 1817 Trumbull was commissioned to paint larger versions of his Revolutionary War
                paintings for the Capitol, which work he completed in 1824. In 1831 he donated his
                art collection to Yale College; his donation formed the basis of the nascent Yale
                University Art Gallery.</p>
      <p>John Trumbull died in New York City on November 10, 1843</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Collection consists predominantly of correspondence with family members and other
                individuals. The letters are largely of a personal nature, particularly those to his
                family, but many are concerned with his work as an artist. In the correspondence
                series are two volumes of letters. The first volume and a half relate to John
                Trumbull: his work as an artist, requests for prints, and family correspondence. The
                second half of volume two contains letters written to Benjamin Silliman: there are
                letters introducing students who wish to study with Silliman; notification of an
                honorary Doctor of Medicine degree from Bowdoin College; correspondence from
                chemical societies; and discussion of Silliman's publications. None of the Silliman
                letters concern any member of the Trumbull family. The collection also includes
                financial records, containing a receipt book for prints of <title>The Declaration of
                    Independence</title> and his accounts with <corpname>Hartford Bank</corpname>.
                An interesting piece is a genealogy given to Trumbull by Uncas showing Uncas'
                ancestry from Tamaquashad, Chief Sachem of the Pequots. Additional items include
                fragments cut from letters and other manuscripts bearing Trumbull's signature. </p>
