            <p> Newton Case Brainard (1904-1964) became a member of the Connecticut Historical
                Society (CHS) on January 5, 1904. From May 19, 1953 until May 21, 1963, Brainard
                served as the President of CHS, but continued to be an active member of the Standing
                Committee and the Society until his death on July 16, 1964. He was born in Hartford,
                Connecticut on December 26, 1880 to Leverett and Mary (Bulkeley) Brainard. Brainard
                was a lifelong Connecticut resident, graduating from Yale in 1902 and earning a
                Master of Arts Degree from Trinity College in 1946.</p>
            <p>Brainard was very active in his community and in 1920 he was elected Mayor of
                Hartford. Later, he served on the Board of Park Commissioners. He was an ardent
                supporter for the erection of a municipal airport and, as such, Brainard Field was
                named in honor of him and dedicated in 1921. Brainard was also instrumental in
                saving the Hartford State House and, in part due to his position as Chairman of
                Hartford’s Fine Arts Commission, oversaw that the building was kept in repair and
                personally saw to it that the Senate Chamber was refurnished. According to the
                Society’s Annual Report of 1965, “His interests were varied and many, and his
                friendship for and generosity to this Society were unparalleled.”</p>

            <p>For further information about Newton C. Brainard, see the Connecticut Historical
                Society’s Annual Report of 1965, which contains a detailed article about him in its
                Necrology section, pages 7-9. </p>

            <p> This collection contains the correspondence of Newton C. Brainard, a Past President
                of the Connecticut Historical Society, as well as the correspondence of Thompson
                Harlow, former Director of CHS, all of which relates to their research on the
                origins of the seal of the city of Hartford that was reportedly first used on a
                diploma bestowed upon Hector Lewis St. John Crèvecoeur (1735-1813) in 1785 by the
                mayor of Hartford. There are also research notes, an exhibit placard, newspaper
                articles, and pictures of the original Hartford seal. The collection also contains
                an embossing of the seal itself.</p>
