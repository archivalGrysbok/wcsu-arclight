            <head>Historical Sketch</head>
            <p>Newton Case Brainard (1880-1964), President of the Connecticut Historical Society
                from 1953-1963, collected the bulk of this material. It was under his leadership
                that the Historical Society entered into an agreement with the City of Hartford
                concerning ownership and management of the Old State House, and researched and
                carried out a restoration of the 1792 historic building.</p>
            <p>The courts and General Assembly met in what is known as the Old State House in
                Hartford, Connecticut, from 1796-1878 until a new capitol was constructed in
                Bushnell Park. Once the state government left the Old State House, Hartford city
                government moved in and used the building as City Hall until 1905.</p>
            <p>The structure experienced numerous “improvements” over time and once the city left,
                the building fell into disrepair. Several citizen efforts saved the Old State House
                from demolition throughout the 20th century. On November 3, 1959, the City and the
                Connecticut Historical Society signed an agreement “assuring that the building would
                be owned and maintained by the City but managed by the historical society. Under the
                thoughtful leadership of Newton C. Brainard, the building was repainted, historical
                exhibits established, and the Senate Chamber restored as well as could be done at
                the time.” (1) That agreement lapsed in 1975 when Hartford eliminated expenditures
                to maintain the Old State House. Again, citizen groups responded, and the Old State
                House Association was formed. The Association signed a 99-year lease with the City
                and raised funds for another restoration and an endowment. In 2006 the building
                opened with a new exhibit “History is All Around Us” created by the staff of CHS,
                and under the direction of the historical society serves a large school population
                with educational programs. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The accession record for this collection indicates that Newton C. Brainard donated
                the collection in 1980. However, Brainard died in 1964. That accession record also
                indicates the gift consisted of three boxes. Only two boxes were found under that
                number.</p>
            <p>The collection consists primarily of correspondence, 1959-1960, and research notes,
                pamphlets, newspaper clippings and transcripts of manuscript items, 1910-1984,
                illustrating the history of the Old State House and the numerous attempts to “save”
                it.</p>
            <p>In addition to Brainard’s collected research, several other interesting items ended
                up here. One is correspondence and fund raising notices from the Society of the
                Colonial Dames in their efforts to raise funds to save the Old State House in
                1910-1911. There also is a folder containing information on the return of the Senate
                chairs, 1927-1961.</p>
            <p>Dating after Brainard’s tenure are slides of the building, taken in 1967-68, a file
                on the Old State House from Jon M. K. Davis, 1978-1982, and notes and correspondence
                concerning an exhibit, “Connecticut’s Own” proposed by the Historical Society for
                the Old State House, 1984. </p>
