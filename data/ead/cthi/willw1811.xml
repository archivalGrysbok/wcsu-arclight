      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Although these papers relate to the Williams family, we have little biographical
                information on any of the major correspondents other than William Williams. He was
                born on April 8, 1731 in Lebanon, Connecticut to Solomon Williams, pastor of the
                town's First Congregational Church and Mary (Porter) Williams. William received his
                early education at Nathan Tisdale's school and graduated from Harvard in 1751. After
                this he began studying theology under his father. </p>
      <p>In 1755, Williams entered military service as a surgeon under his cousin, Colonel
                Ephraim Williams, who was contributing to the French and Indian War effort at Lake
                George. When the war ended, Williams returned to Lebanon, Connecticut and set up
                business. </p>
      <p>Williams served in a number of local political roles, including that of Town
                Treasurer, Town Selectman, Town Clerk, and Justice of the Peace for Connecticut
                Colony. In 1757 he served on the General Assembly of Connecticut, and in 1766 he
                became Clerk of the House. This role landed him several other duties, including that
                of assisting and advising Governor Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. in his preparation of an
                address to His Majesty on the Stamp Act. </p>
      <p>Williams increased his ties with the Trumbull family and thereby improved his
                political standing on February 14, 1771, when he married Jonathan Trumbull's
                daughter, Mary. A few years later, in October 1774, he achieved executive powers
                second only to his father-in-law when he was appointed Speaker of the House.</p>
      <p>Like Jonathan Trumbull, William Williams was very active in Revolutionary activities.
                In April 1775 he was part of a group who secretly took money from the treasury, in
                exchange for their promissory notes, to finance the surprise attack on Fort
                Ticonderoga. In October of that same year, Williams was appointed as an alternate to
                the Continental Congress, though it is said he wished to avoid joining that body.
                Nonetheless, he joined the Continental Congress in time to sign the Declaration of
                Independence and to help frame the Articles of Confederation. </p>
      <p>Williams also had a lengthy legal career, serving as judge of the Windham County
                Court from 1776 to 1805 and as probate judge for the Windham District from 1775 to
                1809. Williams died in Lebanon, Connecticut on August 2, 1811. </p>
      <p>What we know about other significant contributors to this collection is sparse,
                limited to birth and death dates in most cases. The other members of the Williams
                family who have a major presence in these folders include four children of Ezekiel
                Williams's son, John Williams and his second wife, Mary Dyer Silliman: Thomas Scott
                Williams, Sophia Williams, Mary Dyer Williams, and Elizabeth Byrne Williams. Thomas
                Williams was born on November 20, 1818 and graduated from Yale College in 1838 and
                studied law in Hartford under his uncle, also named Thomas Scott Williams, and at
                Harvard. He had only just begun his career when he died on September 18, 1842 at the
                age of twenty-four. Esther Sophia Williams was born on May 19, 1820. She never
                married and died of tuberculosis on March 18, 1847. Mary Dyer Williams was born to
                John and Mary (Dyer) Williams on February 10, 1822. She married Rev. Charles Backus
                McLean on July 9, 1845 but had no children. She died on November 21, 1905. Elizabeth
                Byrne Williams was born on March 10, 1828. On July 21, 1858 she married William
                Watson Andrews; this was his second marriage. Together they had five children, the
                eldest, Mary Williams Andrews, being born on May 29, 1860 and the youngest,
                Elizabeth Parkhill Andrews being born on September 9, 1868. Elizabeth Williams
                Andrews died on December 4, 1906. Another correspondent was John Williams's daughter
                from his previous marriage to Sophia Worthington, Hannah Hopkins Williams. She was
                born on February 3, 1805 and was an active correspondent with her half-sisters from
                the 1830s until her death on February 26, 1846.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection consists largely of Williams family correspondence, much of which is
                personal in nature. It was originally titled the William Williams Papers, and in the
                first two boxes there are several letters to and from William Williams relating
                external affairs: politics, the goings-on of Congress, and military logistics such
                as provision of pork and horses. Some of the later William Williams letters relate
                to his position as a probate judge and contain discussions of debt and other
                matters. Such correspondence is arranged chronologically. The collection of family
                correspondence extends nearly one hundred years beyond William Williams's death,
                until 1903. Most of these later letters were written between Ezekiel Williams's
                granddaughters: Hannah, Sophia, Mary, and Elizabeth. The last decades of
                correspondence in this collection are dominated by letters between Elizabeth
                Williams Andrews and her daughters, Mary Williams Andrews and Elizabeth Parkhill
                Andrews. Also notable are several signatures of a day book, mostly religious in
                nature, that William Williams kept from 1776 until shortly before his death in 1811.
                There is one folder of accounts kept by William Williams. The primary correspondents
                in this collection include: William Williams, Solomon Williams, Ezekiel Williams,
                Thomas Williams, John Williams, Mary Williams, Joseph Trumbull, and Jonathan
                Trumbull, Sr.</p>

        <p>Materials are organized into three series based largely on form.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Correspondence </emph>consists of correspondence
                    written by and to William Williams, some of which relates to his activities
                    during the American Revolution. A great part of this correspondence belongs to
                    the Williams family more generally -- Sophia, Mary, and Elizabeth Williams in
                    particular -- and continues as such for nearly one hundred years past William
                    Williams' death.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Personal Notes </emph>consists of notes taken by
                    William Williams, spanning from the Revolutionary period until his death in
                    1811. Most of the notes are of a religious nature.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series III: Accounts</emph> consists of accounts kept by
                    William Williams from 1775 until 1799, as well as some undated papers.</p>
        <p>Collection is arranged chronologically within in each series. </p>
