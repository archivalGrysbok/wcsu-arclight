      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>David Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut on February 5, 1751, the third son of
                Jonathan Trumbull, Sr. and Faith Robinson Trumbull. He spent most of his life as a
                farmer in Lebanon, though he spent many of the Revolutionary War years at the War
                Office as his father's right-hand man. </p>
      <p>During the war David Trumbull helped his father raise and equip troops; he handled
                the forwarding of supplies not only to the land and naval forces of the state, but
                to the entire northern army. David served as Assistant Commissary-General under his
                brother, Joseph Trumbull. David's wife would later receive a pension for this
                service.</p>
      <p> It was during the hostilities, on December 6, 1778, that David Trumbull married
                Sarah Backus, daughter of Ebenezer and Eunice Dyer Backus of Norwich, Connecticut.
                David's brother, Jonathan, had married Sarah's sister, Eunice, in 1769. Together
                they had six children, one of whom died immediately after birth.</p>
      <p>Trumbull spent the remainder of his life after the war in Lebanon, Connecticut, where
                he was active in local affairs and went twice to the General Assembly as Lebanon's
                representative. He died on January 17, 1822; his wife followed on June 2, 1846.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Collection consists largely of correspondence, letters, and supporting material
                written in both personal and official roles. Such correspondence is arranged
                chronologically. Much of the correspondence is from the period of the American
                Revolutionary War. There are also a few folders of receipts, bills, and accounts,
                also mainly from the Revolutionary period. Of particular interest is a passport, or
                permit of ingress, issued to David Trumbull by his father Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.,
                Governor of Connecticut. Some notable correspondents include Peter Colt, Christopher
                Backus, Eliphalet Dyer, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott, James Glover, Jeremiah
                Wadsworth, John Porter, and Joseph Otis.</p>
