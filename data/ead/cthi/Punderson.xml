            <p>Ebenezer Punderson (1735-1809) was the son of Rev. Ebenezer Punderson (1702-1764) of
                Ledyard, Connecticut. The younger Ebenezer graduated from Yale in 1755 and was
                admitted to King’s College in New York City in 1757. In the years prior to the
                Revolution, he taught school in Preston, Connecticut. His property was confiscated
                due to his “political opinions.” He lived in England until the war was nearly over,
                and then waited in New York City until he could reclaim his property in Preston and
                establish himself as a merchant. In 1756, he married Prudence Geer (1735-1822) of
                Norwich, Connecticut. She was the daughter of Ebenezer Geer (1709-1763) and Prudence
                Wheeler (1712-1797).</p>
            <p>Ebenezer and Prudence Geer Punderson had eight children. Prudence (1758-1784), who
                married Dr. Timothy Wells Rossiter, Hannah (1760-1802) who married William Stanton,
                Ebenezer (1762-1847), Clarina (1764-1846) who married James Tyler, Martha (b. 1766)
                who married John Ayres, Sylvia (1768-1826), Cyrus (b. 1770) and Ephraim (1772-1775).
                Prudence and Timothy Rossiter had a daughter, Sophia Rossiter, who married Nathan
                Geer in 1816. Their children were Prudence Sophia Geer (1830-1863), Punderson
                (1817-1906) and Denison (1818-1896).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection is a combination of purchase and gift, both conducted in 1963/64. The
                materials are organized alphabetically by last and then first name, except for the
                Pundersons, whose names come first. The Ebenezers are arranged chronologically.</p>
            <p>Ebenezer (1702-1764) is represented by two letters he wrote to the Governor of
                Connecticut requesting his salary, which should have been raised from tax
                collections, 1751. His son, Ebenezer (1735-1809) was served two writs, one demanding
                he answer to his sister Helen, and one ordering the confiscation of goods from
                brothers Ebenezer and Cyrus, 1775, 1776. Ebenezer wrote an acrostic to his wife
                Prudence, 1779, from Huntington, NY and wrote to his daughters and sisters. One
                letter in particular provides a description of Moravian society, which he describes
                for one of his sisters, 1783. There are also copies of documents relating to the
                confiscation and return of his property during the Revolution, 1775-1809. The
                originals of these documents are in the Connecticut State Library.</p>
            <p>Ebenezer, Jr. (1762-1847), wrote to his father in 1802 about the falling price of
                grains and flour and to his mother in 1812 with family news. An undated letter is an
                admonishment to his cousin concerning is use of “corrupt language”.</p>
            <p>Prudence Punderson kept a chapbook or journal, ca, 1770, filled with poems, quotes,
                and nature sketches. The drawings relate to needlework in the museum collection. </p>
            <p>James Geer represented Sophia Rossiter Geer in a legal case concerning her father’s
                estate. His correspondence, both incoming and outgoing, 1846-1849, primarily relate
                to that case.</p>
            <p>Punderson Geer, son of Sophia and Nathan Geer, received many invitations and quite a
                number of letters from friends, 1863-1889. His Uncle Isaac Geer wrote a multi-page
                poem praising his nephew Punderson and bound the sheets into a booklet for
                presentation in 1884.</p>
            <p>Sophia Rossiter Geer is represented by correspondence, 1836-1862, which cover years
                before and after her marriage. One of her most constant correspondents was her
                father, Timothy Rossiter of Georgia. His letters to Sophia date from 1799-1845.</p>
            <p>These papers are supplemented by several handwritten notes and published obituaries
                of Punderson/Geer family members. A significant number of letters remain
                unidentified as to either correspondent, dating from 1775-1882. Further research may
                discover family relationships.</p>
