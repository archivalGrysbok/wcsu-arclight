            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>A cooper by trade, Benjamin Bunnell was born in 1704 in New Milford, Connecticut. He
                and his wife Mehitable Baldwin had nine children. Among the children were Benjamin
                (1731-1770) of Derby and Isaac (1734-1808) of Oxford. Isaac’s son Luke was born in
                Derby in 1758 and like his grandfather Benjamin appears to have been a cooper. He
                also served the town of Oxford as constable.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> 	The records in this collection are arranged by generation.  Benjamin Bunnell’s account book for coopering and trade was continued by his grandson Luke and covers the years 1756, when Benjamin proudly writes about his purchase on the inside of the book, to 1808.  Inside the front cover is an index of accounts, and a single sheet listing the births and deaths of Benjamin’s children and grandchildren.  Toward the back of the book, Benjamin recorded an “account of what I have gave to my daughter Abigail by way of her portion” and another account of what Abigail has of her sister’s portion after Mehitable’s death.  A recipe for medicine to treat the “bloody flux” is written on the last page of the volume.</p>
            
            <p>Isaac Bunnell’s son, Luke, settled his father’s estate.  Records include probate documents, inventories, and lists of bills and notes due.  The bulk of Luke’s papers are an assortment of accounts, bills and receipts, many of them written on tiny fragments of paper.  Most appear to relate to his coopering business.  His constable’s papers, 1786-1822, include oaths sworn out against individuals, accounts for serving summonses, etc., executions and receipts, a summons, and a petition to the New Haven County Court.</p>
            
            <p>Various family members are included in the collection.  Mrs. Betty Bunnell was hired as a teacher in Derby in1785, her salary paid by a list of subscribers.  An account ob Reuben Bunnell’s from 1788-1789 indicates he was a cobbler.  William and Mehitable are represented by fragments of accounts from 1791-1792. David Bunnell loaned money to a friend or associate, as evidenced by a 1795 promissory note.  Abigail Buckingham is represented by an inventory of her furniture, 1813.</p>
            
            <p>In 1783, a list of subscribers agreed to pay for supporting a school in Derby in the 7th District.  Oxford town records are primarily financial, including an account of work on the Sherman meadow, 1804, tax documents, 1816, 1821, and a bill, 1825.
