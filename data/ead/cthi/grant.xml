      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Ellsworth Strong Grant was born October 8, 1917 in Wethersfield, Connecticut. He
                graduated from Kingswood School, West Hartford in 1935 and earned his A.B. degree at
                Harvard College in 1939. From 1940 to 1958, he held various positions in the
                administration of the Allen Manufacturing Company that made socket screws and other
                precision fasteners. His positions included Personnel Manager and Industrial
                Relations Director. In 1958 he was named President and Treasurer of Connecticut
                Manifold Forms Co. in West Hartford and was named General Manager after that company
                merged with Allied Paper Co.</p>
      <p> Grant was active in civic affairs. He was a director at Kaman Aircraft in
                Bloomfield, Conn., Newton Company, and West Hartford Publishing Company. He founded
                the Hartford Small Plant Medical Service in 1946, was a trustee of the Renbrook
                School, served on committees of the Greater Hartford Community Chest, and directed a
                fund raising campaign for the Asylum Hill Congregational Church in Hartford, among
                many other activities. More information can be found in his resumes.</p>
      <p> He was married to Marion Hepburn, sister of Katharine Hepburn, and as a result was
                involved with the Fenwick Production Company in Saybrook, Connecticut, a company
                that made documentary films. Many of those movies are now in the collections of the
                Graphics Department. Grant wrote many articles on industrial relations and personnel
                management. He also published monographs on aspects of Connecticut History. Those
                titles can be found in the CHS library collections. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <arrangement>
        <p>The collection was left in Grant’s home in West Hartford when he sold the house
                    in 2003. The current owners, who tried to return the materials to Grant, donated
                    them to CHS to prevent their being destroyed. The materials fall into two clear
                    series and are arranged as such. Series I contains business papers with what he
                    termed “papers” first, followed by professional memberships and activities
                    arranged alphabetically by title, and then correspondence. Series II is devoted
                    to his personal and civic life and are arranged in chronological order except
                    for his outside activities which are again alphabetically arranged. Folder
                    titles are taken from the originals except when enclosed in brackets.</p>
      </arrangement>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Business papers</emph> The file folders labeled by Grant as “papers” contain articles or speeches
                he wrote, mainly on the topic of personnel management, and correspondence, all
                primarily arranged in reverse chronological order and dated 1944-1954. These are
                followed by correspondence, reports, studies and memoranda concerning his outside
                professional activities, arranged alphabetically, and including Chamber of Commerce,
                Hartford Committee for Employment of Physically Handicapped, the Hartford Small
                Plant Medical Service, and the Unemployment Compensation Advisory Council,
                1947-1965. His business correspondence dates 1948-1950. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Personal papers</emph> This contains personal papers and
                begins with what Grant called old letters and papers, which include correspondence
                and essays on such topics as cinema, press and radio. His personal correspondence
                dates 1940-1969. Among his correspondents were Caspar Weinberger, Cleveland Amory,
                Thomas Dodd and Lord Beaverbrook. One folder of correspondence is with a family in
                Germany, the Faulstroh’s, 1947-1959, some of which is written in German. A selection
                of papers from Grant’s days at Harvard includes essays, course descriptions,
                compositions, term papers, and reports. In the folder entitled Education I is a
                Report of Student Council Committee on Education, June 12, 1939, a committee on
                which Grant served. </p>
      <p>Civic and charitable activities are arranged alphabetically. The
                Community Chest file contains newsletters, correspondence and reports. The Crusade
                for Freedom, 1951, was an attempt to get individuals to sign a pledge supporting the
                constitution and opposing communism. This file contains articles, correspondence, a
                citation issued to Grant, a sample pledge form, and reports. Grant helped raise
                funds for school construction at the Renbrook School, from 1957 to 1961. He was also
                active in the Sheldon Association, an organization promoting civic improvement in
                the area of Hartford around Sheldon, Arch and South Prospect streets. This file
                contains correspondence, the organization’s constitution, and newsletters. Grant’s
                “other activities” included fund raising for the Asylum Hill Congregational Church
                in Hartford, and serving on the Hartford Association for Retarded Children. This
                series also contains numerous examples of Grant’s writings, what he called stories.</p>
      <p> Unique among Grant’s papers are two scripts for a film directed by John Ford in
                1938. Evidently, John Ford was a great friend of Katharine Hepburn’s which explains
                the existence of these scripts among Grant’s papers. The first copy is the first
                draft, continuity. The second is the shooting final. The film was released under the
                title of Submarine Patrol. The final item in the collection is a published book
                about the Grant Memorial in Washington, DC. It may only be that he and the General
                shared a last name, or it could be Ellsworth was a descendant. </p>
