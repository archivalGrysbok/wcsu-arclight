            <p>The Tuttle family lived primarily in North Haven and Hamden, Connecticut. Hezekiah
                Tuttle was born May 20, 1749 to Jude and Lydia (Atwater) Tuttle. He married Mary
                Turner on March 19, 1770. They had seven children: Jesse (3/8/1771-10/26/1847), Eli
                (3/1/1775-?), Elam (7/30/1777-10/11/1856), Caleb Atwater (11/18/1779-8/25/1844),
                Lydia (3/4/1783-?), Asahel (8/27/1787-3/16/1854), and Miles (9/3/1792-8/21/1836).
                Hezekiah Tuttle died January 5, 1829 at age 73.</p> <p>Hezekiah’s oldest son, Jesse Tuttle,
                was born on March 8, 1771. Jesse Tuttle was baptized on May 28, 1780, according to
                the Congregational Society of North Haven. He married Esther Pierpont
                (10/27/1771-11/11/1857) on September 30, 1795. Esther was the daughter of Giles and
                Elizabeth (Cooper) Pierpont of North Haven, CT. Jesse and Esther had two sons,
                Dennis (3/31/1797-9/26/1878) and Zerah Pierpont (10/2/1800-?), and a daughter,
                Elizabeth (4/5/1809-11/13/1849). According to the accession records for this
                collection, Jesse Tuttle was a joiner and cabinetmaker in North Haven, CT. He died
                on October 26, 1847 at age 76.</p> <p> Dennis Tuttle, Jesse’s oldest son, was born March 31,
                1797. His first wife was Nancy T. Sanford, whom he married on September 24, 1820.
                Three years later, on December 15, 1823, Dennis Tuttle married Jerusha Gillet.
                According to the 1850 and 1870 US Federal Census records, he was a farmer in North
                Haven, CT and had at least one child, Lewis G. Tuttle, who was born around 1837.</p>
                <p>Lewis Tuttle, a farmer in North Haven like his father, married a woman named Louisa
                around 1858 and their first child, Elizabeth, was born circa 1859. The 1870 US
                Federal Census lists Lewis and Louisa living with his father, Dennis, and their
                eleven-year-old daughter, Elizabeth and eight-year-old son, George. According to the
                1880 US Federal Census, Lewis and Louisa had seven children in 1880: Libby (age 21
                in 1880), George (age 19 in 1880), Martin (age 14 in 1880), Dennis (age 9 in 1880),
                Essie [Esther] (age 6 in 1880), and Willard (age 3 in 1880). In the 1920 US Federal
                Census, Lewis Tuttle, then age 84, is listed as living with his daughter, Elizabeth,
                then age 60, as well as his daughter, Esther Kinsey, then age 45, and his
                son-in-law, Ingham Kinsey, then age 50. It is presumed that this Esther Kinsey is
                the same woman whose documents appear in the Tuttle Family collection and whose
                letters refer to the Tuttle family.</p> <p>For additional information about the Tuttle
                family, see Families of Ancient New Haven, compiled by Donald Lines Jacobus
                (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc.: 1981). </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> This collection, which encompasses the accession numbers 81604, 81605, and 81606,
                contains materials dated from 1759 to 1953, but the bulk of the collection was
                created between 1770 and 1850. It has been arranged according to the individuals who
                produced the records and, to the extent possible, proceeds chronologically with more
                general records in the later folders.</p> <p> The majority of the collection consists of
                deeds. There are almost 70 separate deeds produced by or for Hezekiah Tuttle between
                1770 and 1831. Jesse Tuttle and his son Dennis also have a number of deeds. The
                oldest document in this collection is a deed belonging to Simon Tuttle, a relative
                of Hezekiah and Jesse. Some of these deeds relate to North Haven residents, but do
                not, upon first glance, appear to belong directly to the Tuttle family. These deeds
                have been placed in a separate folder marked “North Haven Deeds” for the sake of
                clarity. </p> <p> Another highlight of this collection is Jesse Tuttle’s account books that
                cover a thirty-six year period from 1792 to 1828. These accounts detail his working
                pattern including where he worked and how long for different people, including
                family members. Money that is owed to him or paid to him is also recorded in these
                logs.</p> <p>This collection also contains the estate papers for three generations of
                Tuttle men: Jude, Hezekiah, and Jesse. These papers include inventories of their
                estates and to whom belongings, land, and money were left. In the case of Jesse
                Tuttle, the record from the Probate Court naming Dennis and Zerah Tuttle as
                administers of his estate.</p> <p> During his lifetime, Jesse Tuttle was appointed a
                collector of the “Ecclesiastical Society Rates” in North Haven in 1798. Related to
                this appointment are the property lists from the residents of North Haven. These
                property lists acted as declarations of taxable property and the amount each
                individual owed seems to have been determined from their lists. The majority of the
                lists were from the years 1801 and 1802, which suggests that Jesse Tuttle may have
                been a collector for more than one year.</p> <p> Finally, in this collection, there are a
                few documents that belonged to Esther Kinsey, the granddaughter of Dennis Tuttle.
                The church program from the dedication of the fifth meeting-house of the North Haven
                Congregational Church is of note along with an “In Memoriam” booklet featuring the
                poetry of the late Angelina M. Tuttle. Also among Esther Kinsey’s items is a
                birthday card from Mrs. Lydia C. Bowen of Arlington, California that mentions the
                Tuttle family, in particular Esther’s brother, George. </p>
