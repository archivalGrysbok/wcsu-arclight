            <p>Jonathan Bull (1649-1702) was born in Hartford, Connecticut shortly after that city’s
                settlement. He went by the title Captain and/or Major. He and his wife Sarah Whiting
                Bull had eight children. Their oldest son, Jonathan (1696-1765) trained and worked
                as a physician and married Hannah Beach, with whom he had two children, Jonathan and
                Hannah.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Bull (1746-1825) was the fourth generation of his family to live in
                Hartford. He was a distinguished lawyer and judge, having graduated from Yale in
                1765. In 1810 Thomas Jefferson appointed him Commissioner of Loans for Connecticut.
                He married Delia Seymour, the daughter of Jerred and Deliverance Skinner Seymour.
                Their surviving children included Delia, who married Thomas Tisdall as his second
                wife, Elizabeth who married James Dodd as his second wife in 1834, Charles, and
                Cornelia, who married James Dodd as his first wife in 1815.</p>

            <p>Hartford Postmaster John Dodd (1745-1809) with his first wife had children John,
                Henry, and Sally. He married as his second wife Mary Steel, daughter of James and
                Mary Skinner Steel and they had one child, James (b. 1786) who married Cornelia Bull
                and then her sister, Elizabeth Bull. Son John died one day after his father in 1809. </p>

        <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection primarily consists of deeds for land in Hartford, specifically South
                Meadow, to members of the Bull family. Some of these deeds represent the earliest
                Hartford deeds in the CHS collection. All three Jonathan Bull’s bought and sold
                property.</p>

            <p>Of interest in the deeds of Jonathan Bull (1649-1702) is a deed signed by Thomas
                Hooker (not the founder of Hartford) and one signed by a woman, Sarah Wells. The
                papers of Jonathan Bull (1746-1825) include letters written to him as Commissioner
                of Loans from the Treasury of the United States. One of the signatories was Albert
                Gallatin. Jonathan’s appointments as Commissioner are signed by Thomas Jefferson,
                President, and Secretary of State James Madison. Other Bull family members, namely
                Jonathan (1746-1825), and his grandchildren Elizabeth, Hannah, Charles and Henry,
                are represented by estate inventories, deeds, correspondence, and memorial poems to
                Hannah, which were published in the newspaper at her death in 1809.</p>


            <p>A separate file of Hartford Land Records was created (Folder 10) to hold documents
                with no obvious direct tie to the Bull family. These include deeds, and several hand
                drawn maps of Hartford, none of which are dated.</p>

            <p>Significant among John Dodd’s papers are a multi-paged inventory of his estate taken
                at the time of his death in 1809. A letter to G. Granger notifies him of Dodd’s
                death and the need to appoint a new person to the post. John Dodd, his wife Mary and
                their son John all died within a week of each other from spotted fever. James Dodd
                is represented by deeds, financial records, and incoming correspondence.</p>

            <p>Zebulon Seymour (1709-1765), the husband of Keziah Bull and a Hartford joiner, has
                papers included in this collection. They consist of orders for payment and other
                financial correspondence, 1765-1790, and a 1779 certificate giving Seymour
                permission to build a dam, gristmill, and saw mill on the Little River in Hartford.
                In other Seymour family papers is an account of ordnance tuned into store at
                Hartford January 1, 1777, for use of the State Guard under the command of Israel
                Seymour, signed by Oliver Ellsworth.</p>

            <p>Also in this collection are several newspaper clippings and an 1819 letter written by
                artist Sarah Goodridge (1788-1853).</p>

            <p>Among the unidentified items are what appear to be a series of letters from a person
                (E.W.?) on board a vessel traveling the Erie Canal from Rochester to Albany, NY. The
                genealogical notes are on the Bull, Stee(e), Dodd and Tisdale families. </p>
