      <p>Timothy M. Allyn was a Hartford dry goods merchant, one time mayor of the city
                (1858-1860) , an entrepreneur and an astute businessman. He founded his dry goods
                business in Hartford about 1830 and retired in 1848, after amassing a large fortune,
                to pursue other interests. Allyn served on the Board of Directors of numerous
                businesses in Hartford and was named president of the Hartford Carpet Company in
                1854. He was born in Hartford in 1800 and died in the same city in August 1882. He
                married Susan Pratt and they had five children, including Arthur W., Robert, and
                Joseph Pratt Allyn.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p> The collection consists primarily of business correspondence concerning court cases
                to collect debts, selling land in Connecticut and Wisconsin, proposing a development
                project, discussing financial issues, and investing and divesting of shares in
                different companies. The letters have been arranged chronologically.</p>
      <p>There are several items of note. On April 29, 1850 the company Sayles, Merriam &amp;
                Brewer of Boston, sent Allyn a price list of Amoskeag Manufacturing Company’s
                “domestics” that they carried for sale. In 1855 Allyn, as president of the Hartford
                Carpet Company, was sent a notice that the company needed more capital to say in
                business. The company had opened its doors in 1854.</p>
      <p>Allyn received a letter from his son, Joseph, in 1851 describing in great
                detail a visit to Niagara Falls. Three years later he wrote from Wisconsin
                describing his business in that state and eleven months later he described financial
                problems in Ohio. Neither of the business ventures is described in any detail.</p>
      <p>Among the more personal correspondence Allyn received was a May 15, 1850 letter
                asking him to pay the Unitarian Society’s debt. That same year, in February, Allyn
                received a missive from Boston concerning casting a bell for use in a stone tower.
                In December 1850 the New Haven Musical Association offered to purchase the oratorio
                “Seven Sleepers” that Allyn obviously owned.</p>
      <p>One letter does not belong to the Allyn family. Jonathan G. Pratt in Louisiana wrote
                in 1852 to his brother Joseph Pratt in Hartford about their father’s failing health.
                These men were probably related to Allyn’s wife, Susan Pratt.</p>
