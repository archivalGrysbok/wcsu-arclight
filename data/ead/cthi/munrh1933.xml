      <p>Collection consists of personal correspondence between Henry Smith Monroe and his
                family, and correspondence dealing with Munroe's mining and engineering works, as
                consultant and as a teacher of mining at universities in the United States and
                Japan. A significant portion of the correspondence, and its supporting documents,
                relate to lands and land deals in Tennessee. Also included are numerous maps and
                plans and diagrams of mine workings, surveying statistics and engineering diagrams.
                Some material touches on Munroe role as professor of mining at Columbia
                University.</p>

        <head>Arrangement</head>
        <p>Papers are organized into seven series based predominantly on original order and
                    the creator (viz. "collector") of a given series. This is particularly apparent
                    in Series I: Edmund Munroe Correspondence, the latter part of which consists
                    almost exclusively of letters authored and written by Harry Smith Munroe.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Edmund Munroe Correspondence </emph>consists of
                    letters to and from Edmund Munroe, Henry Smith's Father, and from members of his
                    immediate family. Much of the correspondence in this series concerns Edmund's
                    dealing with land agents and with land owners in Tennessee, particularly Samuel
                    Barrell of Knoxville, and the Honourable Felix Grundy of Nashville. From ca.
                    1869 onward the series consists almost solely of letters authored by Harry Smith
                    Munroe, addressed to his parents, and father in particular.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Henry Smith Munroe Correspondence</emph> consists
                    mixed personal and business correspondence, arranged chronologically. Much of
                    the earlier correspondence concerns land acquisitions and dealings with lawyers,
                    particularly Charles Seymour, and surveyors in Tennessee. Such correspondence
                    and other supporting documents relates closely to that of Edmund Munroe and the
                    Barrell Lands. Later correspondence concerns mining and engineering projects,
                    and his work at the Columbia University as Professor of Mining.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series III: Articles, Reports and Essays </emph>consists of
                    written mining and engineering reports, frequently containing technical diagrams
                    and related evidence.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series IV: Personal Writings </emph>consists of diaries,
                    notebooks, travel accounts, jottings and rough calculations.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series V: Financial Papers </emph>consists of bills and
                    receipts of sale, small account books, indentures and agreements, and insurance
                    papers.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series VI: Columbia University</emph> consists of teaching
                    material(notes for lectures), statements of grades, student reports, notebooks
                    on 'academic politics' and material specifically relating to the Summer School
                    of Mining held annually at the School of mines. General interdepartmental
                    memoranda and correspondence, and formal university proclamations may be found
                    in Series 2: Henry Smith Correspondence under the appropriate year. </p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series VII: Barrell Lands </emph>consists of undated notes
                    and memoranda concerning the Barrell Lands (lands formerly of Samuel Barrell) in
                    Tennessee. Also contains two volumes, one being a survey of those lands by J. W.
                    Davis, the second being minutes of the Trustees of the Barrell Lands for the
                    years 1886-1888. Series II: Henry Smith Munroe Correspondence contains much
                    material relating to transactions and other dealings in regard of these lands,
                    particularly correspondence with land agents and the law office of Charles
                    Seymour of Knoxville. Additional material on the Barrell lands can also be found
                    in Series I: Correspondence of Edmund Munroe.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series VIII: St. Lawrence Pyrites Company </emph> consists of
                    monthly and annual general balance sheets of the St. Lawrence Pyrite Company.
                    Other financial breakdowns include some external contracts, and analyses of
                    milling and extracting operations.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series IX: Maps, Plans and Engineering Diagrams
                    </emph>consists town maps and builders blueprints, engineering diagrams and
                    other technical drawings and illustrations. Some photographs of mining projects
                    are included in this series. Alongside illustrative material are rough
                    calculations and notes relating to mining works.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series X: Memorabilia</emph> consists of invitations,
                    business cards, menus, and tickets.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series XI: Whitney Estate</emph> consists of deeds,
                    agreements and accounts concerning the estates of Sarah Whitney and George
                    Whitney.</p>
        <p><emph render="bold">Series XII: Felix Grundy Mining Co.</emph> consists of two
                    volumes of minutes of the Grundy Mining Company, TN.</p>
        <p>Series divisions are based on original order, folders and volumes being arranged
                    chronologically within each series. Series I: Edmund Munroe Correspondence, from
                    ca. 1869 to onward consists principally of letters written by Edmund's son,
                    Harry. These letters have been preserved in this series, rather than moved to
                    Series II: Harry Smith Munroe Correspondence, in the interest of preserving the
                    integrity of the creator of this series, rather than, necessarily, that of the
                    author.</p>
