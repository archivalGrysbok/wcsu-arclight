            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>William H. Thomas was born about 1840 in New York. He became a minister after serving
                as a soldier in the 4th New Hampshire Regiment in the Civil War, where he was
                chaplain. Before moving to South Norwalk, Connecticut in 1904, he lived and preached
                in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. </p>
            <p>William and his wife Sarah had at least three children, as far as can be ascertained
                from the collection. Daughter Mabel Thomas taught school in Cambridge, Massachusetts
                and in Norwalk. Son William H. Thomas Jr. was in the textile business in Rhode
                Island and for about a year in Quebec, Canada. A second daughter, Eleanor Thomas,
                married John Doughty. In the 1910 federal census, the Doughty family, including
                daughter Felicia, lived in Winchester, Connecticut. By 1930, John Doughty was dead
                and Mabel and Eleanor taught school in Norwalk.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection came with no discernable organization. The diaries were arranged
                first, chronologically. William Thomas’ incoming correspondence was arranged with
                family letters first, followed by general correspondence. If there was incoming
                correspondence to the family, it was filed after the letters to their father. Since
                Thomas was a minister, his church-related papers follow the correspondence. Military
                and financial records complete the collection.</p>
            <p>This collection was transferred from the New Hampshire Historical Society after they
                removed all of the Civil War and New Hampshire-related material. What was left
                reflects Thomas’ activities in Massachusetts before 1904, and in Connecticut from
                1904-1915. Perhaps the most interesting documents are the letters from Mabel, an
                independent single woman living and working near Boston.</p>
            <p>The diaries cover the years 1860-1906, with gaps, particularly between 1861-1866. The
                entries are rather sparse and provide little insight into his daily activities,
                although some of them are reflective of the moral and religious conflicts in his
                mind.</p>
            <p>Thomas’s children wrote to him often, at least in the years 1909 and 1915. There is
                very little material from the intervening years. Mabel was the most prolific writer
                as she described her daily activities and the progress of granddaughter Felicia
                Doughty, 1902-1915. William Jr. wrote detailed letters about setting up a mill in
                Quebec, Canada, and about his work in Rhode Island, 1908-1915. Only a few letters
                exist that were written by daughter Eleanor or granddaughter Felicia.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the collection consists of incoming letters and circulars to William
                Thomas. Some appear to be from former parishioners keeping him up to date on their
                lives. Others are from magazines seeking subscriptions, or from people in Norwalk
                asking him to supply the pulpit in their church while the regular pastor is on
                vacation.</p>
            <p>Among Thomas’s church-related papers are a volume with the names of church members
                and a list of those who needed pastoral visits. His mind must have been constantly
                working, as he kept notes on possible themes for sermons on scraps of paper of all
                sizes and shapes. These have been gathered into one folder and are accompanied by a
                combination note- and scrapbook also used for citing religious themes. </p>
            <p>The only remnants of Thomas’s military service are a few circulars about the
                formation of a military chaplain’s association and a number of form letters from
                lawyers in Washington, DC offering to help him recover lost wages from the war. None
                of the forms appear to have been filled out.</p>
            <p>Financial records are sparse and consist of one volume recording his stocks, 1873,
                and receipts from 1909 only, divided into those for milk and those for other
                household goods. Also among the receipts are two dog licenses. Printed materials are
                primarily church-related which warranted their retention. There are two letters and
                one formula for a prescription in the folder of non-family materials.</p>
