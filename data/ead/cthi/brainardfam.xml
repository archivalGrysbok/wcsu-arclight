            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>The portion of the Brainard family represented in this collection spans more than
                four generations. The progenitor of this line of the Brainard family in present-day
                Higganum, Connecticut, was Cornelius Brainard (ca. 1760- 1838). He married Jerusha
                Brooks on April 18, 1805 and the couple had three sons: William (1806-1900),
                Cornelius (1811-1884) and Abraham (1815-1884). The young men most likely carried on
                an edged tool manufacturing company begun by their father called Brainard, Woodruff
                &amp; Company. Of the brothers that had children, Cornelius' daughters Celestia
                Jerome (Lettie) Brainard (b. 1854) and Kate Amelia (b. 1856) have correspondence in
                the collection. Although the genealogical connection has not been traced, later
                influential generations appear in the collection. The affluent brothers, Morgan
                Bulkeley Brainard (President of Aetna Insurance Company) (1879-1957) and Newton Case
                Brainard (Mayor of Hartford) (1880-1964) were born to the entrepreneur and
                progressive Hartford city office holder Leverett Brainard (1828-1902). The
                collection houses a few manuscripts from each brother</p>

        <arrangement>
            <head>Arrangement Note</head>
            <p>The Brainard family collection is housed in one box containing thirteen folders. With
                letters organized chronologically with one person or entity per folder, the folders
                are then organized chronologically by the birth date of the author and/or recipient
                of the letters inside. Furthermore, each folder contains the respective incoming and
                outgoing letters to the person or business it represents.</p>

            <p>While every attempt has been made to separate personal and business correspondence,
                some of the material related to Brainard, Woodruff &amp; Company and Cornelius
                Brainard may be intermingled. The distinctions between the elder Cornelius and his
                son of the same name are not always clear in their papers, so these may also be
                intermingled. </p>
        </arrangement>
        <scopecontent encodinganalog="520$a">
            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection contains thirteen folders, each with letters written to or received
                by: Jerusha (Brooks) Brainard (ca. 1781-1852), Messrs. Brainard, Woodruff &amp;
                Company (ca. 1833-1834), Cornelius Brainard business correspondence, Cornelius
                Brainard personal correspondence, an expenditures book owned by Cornelius Brainard,
                William Brainard correspondence, Abraham Brainard correspondence, letters belonging
                to other area manufacturers and persons (the carriage-makers Barnes and Darrow Co.
                of Bristol, Messrs. Brewster and Ingraham of Bristol and a personal letter from a
                Brainard L. Peck to Mr. Austin Case of Hamburg, South Carolina), Celestia Jerome
                (Lettie) Brainard correspondence, Kate Amelia Brainard correspondence, Morgan
                Bulkeley Brainard correspondence, Newton Case Brainard correspondence, Florence
                Maynard correspondence and fragmentary letters or letters with unknown authors.</p>

            <p>Much of the earlier part of the collection (pre- 1850) has copious correspondence to
                and from Brainard, Woodruff &amp; Co. as well as the personal and business
                correspondence of Cornelius Brainard the son. Of interest are letters to and from
                Cornelius Brainard regarding his work as an Internal Revenue collector and duties as
                co-operator of the family's edged weapon company. Abraham Brainard's civil service
                career and political life are both highlighted by letters showing his support for
                the Whig Party and notices of his selection as a member of the Committee of
                Organization and Vigilance in School District ____", as well as a letter notifying
                Abraham of his appointment to the rank of Postmaster.</p>

            <p>The later collection contains personal correspondence to Lettie Brainard and her
                sister Kate as well as the scattered correspondence of Morgan Bulkeley Brainard and
                Newton Case Brainard over a wide date range. Interestingly, there is little mention
                of the honorable careers each man held in their adult lives. The remainder of the
                collection contains correspondence to an unknown acquaintance named Florence Maynard
                of Waban, Massachusetts. Of interest to historians and researchers interested in
                early furniture, the Maynard folder contains letters regarding the possible donation
                of a Hadley chest (possibly produced by John Allis) which was owned by the Maynard
                family at the time. In a possibly Brainard connection, Mrs. Maynard is interested in
                donating the piece to the Morgan Memorial and her query is passed to Morgan Bulkeley
                Brainard due to his possible interest.</p>

            <p>The collection ends with a folder of fragmentary letters and letters with unknown
                authors or remitters. </p>
