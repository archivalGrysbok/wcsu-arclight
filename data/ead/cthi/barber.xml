      <p>Walter Craig Barber was born about 1920 in Waterbury, Connecticut. His father, Walter
                Barber, was a surgeon. The younger Walter went by his middle name of Craig. During
                World War II, Craig served with the 5th Armored Division, Company C, 127th Ordnance
                Maintenance Battalion.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p> The museum and library jointly purchased this collection. Uniforms, a duffle bag,
                and patches went to the museum. Photographs were transferred to the Graphics
                Department and the printed and manuscript material went to the library. </p>
      <p> Barberâ€™s papers consist of a diary, 1944, only portions of which were used, mostly
                for listing locations in which the army found itself and for his ruminations. The
                bulk of the incoming correspondence is a series of newsletters, <emph render="italic">The Merriman
                    Chronicles</emph>, written by a friend from Waterbury describing life at home and his
                sons' experiences in the war. A letter dated June 12, 1945 celebrates the end of the
                war in Europe while one dated September 2, 1945 expresses relief at peace with
                Japan.</p>
      <p>Outgoing correspondence includes a letter to Barber's sister, Betsy, dated 1945; a
                polemic concerning extended service in the army, 1945; an undated postcard of a
                bridge in France; and a letter to Mme. Kroonen et Rose, in French, also undated.</p>
      <p>Military documents include an identity document permitting Barber to carry and
                dispatch mail, 1942, a customs declaration, and a pass for three days in Paris. Two
                spiritual texts were given to Barber from his church and are inscribed to him. His
                portable desk or writing portfolio still contains stationery. Printed materials
                include a map of the "Advance of the 5th Armored Division, Seine River to the
                Rhine," a service manual, a history of the 5th Armored Division, bulletins, and
                three issues of <emph render="italic">Victory News</emph>, the newspaper of the 5th Armored Division.</p>
      <p>World War I memorabilia include a soldier's songbook, 1918, and a photographic
                postcard showing Dr. W. Craig Barber operating on a patient in Lyon, France. </p>
      <p>A Brooklyn Dodger's program from a game against Philadelphia in 1946, and eight
                issues of Stars and Stripes were transferred to other institutions, namely the Yogi
                Berra museum and Hofstra University </p>
