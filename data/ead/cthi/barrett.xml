      <p> R. Cecil Barrett was born about 1830 in Massachusetts. He married Catherine Hewins
                of Sharon, Massachusetts and for a time lived in Somers, Connecticut. It was as a
                resident of Somers that Cecil enlisted in the 16th Regiment, Company A Connecticut
                Volunteers in 1862. He held the rank of Corporal. The 16th Regiment saw action at
                the battles of Antietam, Maryland (where Cecil was wounded and captured),
                Fredericksburg and Suffolk, Virginia, and was present when General Lee surrendered
                at Appomattox Court House. On April 5, 1865, Cecil was promoted to 1st Lieutenant,
                Company B, 31st (Connecticut) United States Colored Infantry. He transferred to
                Company F in October, 1864, and a month later transferred again to Company H, which
                in June 1865 found itself in Texas. He was promoted to Captain March 5, 1865 and
                mustered out of the service November 7, 1865.</p>
      <p> After the war, the Barrett family settled in Springfield, Mass. where Cecil was a
                teacher and school superintendent. Among Cecil and Catherine’s children were sons
                Edward, Erastus, Howard and Arthur. Erastus married Cornelia Newell. Arthur moved to
                Colorado to seek his fortune and Edward eventually became the Comptroller of what
                became the California Institute of Technology.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection was donated to the library by the great grandson of R. Cecil Barrett.
                Cecil apparently gave these papers to his son Edward, who handed them down to his
                son, the donor’s father.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection consists of letters written by Cecil to his wife Catherine
                while he was serving in the army during the Civil War. His letters are filled with
                religious contemplations, comments about how much he missed his wife, admonitions to
                his sons to behave for their mother, and detailed descriptions of camp life, picket
                duty, and battles. Several letters include messages to Edward and/or Erastus. A
                number of letters were multi-paged and the pages got separated. An attempt has been
                made to match the texts and return errant pages to their appropriate letters.</p>
      <p>Also in the collection are letters among members of the Hewins family, 1820-1833,
                primarily written to Nancy and Increase Hewins of Sharon, Mass. Two poems were
                written for a Catharine Hewins at her death in 1823. In addition to the letters from
                her husband, Catherine Hewins Barrett received letters from her aunt Nancy Hewins,
                1863-1865. Erastus Barrett is represented by letters to his mother, 1875, a letter
                to his sister, 1875, his marriage certificate, 1878, and two colored photographs of
                what are probably his sons or grandsons, Dick, Newell, Donald and George. </p>
      <p>Horace wrote letters to his sister (1875) and his mother (1878) which are
                in the collection. Arthur wrote two letters home, the one in 1883 mailed from
                Colorado. Erastus’ wife Cornelia is represented by letters she wrote to her sister
                Jennie, 1876-1883, and to her parents, 1883. There are also photographs of Jennie
                and Cornelia Newell Barrett.</p>
