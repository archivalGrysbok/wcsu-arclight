            <p>Selden Warner, son of Jonathan and Elizabeth Selden Warner, was born on October 20,
                1760 in Hadlyme, CT. He died of paralysis at age 82 in Hadlyme, CT on March 1, 1843.
                Selden Warner was a farmer in his hometown and he graduated from Yale College in
                1782. Mr. Warner was living in New London County at the time of the 1790 Census with
                his wife and two sons. He also represented his town several times in the State
                Legislature. Based on court documents within the collection, records indicate that a
                Selden Warner was a Justice of the Peace. While in Hadlyme, Mr. Warner and his wife
                were members of the Congregational Church. He served as Deacon at this church until
                1833, when he asked to be removed from further duty. In addition, Selden Warner was
                a captain in the 33rd Regiment, 3rd Brigade, Connecticut Militia around 1799. He
                married his second cousin Dorothy Selden on June 5, 1788. Dorothy Selden was born on
                December 26, 1766 and she died on August 19, 1825. She was a daughter of Col. Samuel
                and Elizabeth (Ely) Selden, of Hadlyme, CT.</p> <p>Records indicated that there may have
                been a second marriage of Selden Warner, who lived in Lyme, CT to Elizabeth Spencer
                on January 4, 1827.</p> <p>The births of Selden Warner’s first six children were recorded
                in the town records of Lyme, CT. 1) Selden Warner, Jr. (name changed to Samuel
                Selden Warner) born on March 15, 1789; married Abby Champlin; after Abby he married
                Azubah Tully. 2) Andrew Ferdinando Warner was born on December 29, 1790; he married
                Lucinthia Cone. 3) Joseph Warner born on December 3, 1792; he married Mary Ann
                Holmes. 4) Richard Warner was born on October 19, 1794; he married twice, Mary
                Millicent Gilbert and Mary Gaylord. 5) William Henry Warner was born February 18,
                1797; he married Sarah Canfield. 6) Mathew Griswold Warner born on March 6, 1799; he
                married Lucretia Hubbard Loomis. 7) Mary Warner was born on January 17, 1801 and she
                died in Hadlyme on August 10, 1825. Mary was a member of the Congregational Church
                in 1822. 8) Elizabeth Warner was born on April 20, 1803 and she died in Hadlyme on
                September 15, 1825. 9) Jonathan Trumbull Warner was born on November 20, 1807; he
                married Anita Gale. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection was given to the Connecticut Historical Society by Mr. Hayden R.
                Lathrop of Hartford, Connecticut. It consists of family and business letters,
                records of shad fishing on the Connecticut River (1805-1869), legal documents, and
                Warner family accounts (1803-1869). The fishing books itemize the number of fish
                caught by several individuals who probably worked for Selden Warner. The fishing
                records also indicate how much catch was delivered to various fish markets,
                including Fulton Fish Market in New York City. Financial records include bills,
                receipts, and accounts, including accounts with the proprietors of the Cover Fishery
                and the North Minorca Fishing Company.</p> <p>The Selden Warner court papers are of cases
                over which Mr. Warner presided as Justice of the Peace. The severity of the crimes
                varies in scope from debts owed to physical violence. In some contract cases, the
                defendant is unable to pay for their usage of a particular parcel of land and they
                have to appear in front of Selden Warner. The bulk of the materials are writs of
                attachment, summons, and jury summons. Land contracts and deeds are for properties
                owned in Lyme and East Haddam, Connecticut.</p> <p>Nancy W. Ely received some letters
                within collection. Nancy W. Ely is a relative of Elizabeth Ely, daughter of Richard
                Ely and Elizabeth Peck. She was Selden Warner’s sister-in-law. The letters to Nancy
                W. Ely are of a business nature--accounts and financial transactions.</p> <p> A folder of
                assorted Selden Warner legal documents include an agreement to build a pier in Lyme
                in order to catch fish, the minutes of the North Minorca Fishing Company, Joseph
                Warner’s deed, and a lease.</p> <p>In a final folder are documents that appear unrelated to
                the Warner family. They include a composition by Mar Ann Ely, anonymous
                compositions, what appears to be a sermon, school exercises and a commonplace book. </p>
