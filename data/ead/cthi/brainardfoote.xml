            <p>Stephen and Daniel Brainard of East Haddam, Connecticut, were the sons of Daniel
                Brainard, the second of that name in the state. Daniel was born in 1690 and died in
                1728. Stephen was born in 1699. Stephen married Susannah Gates and they settled in
                the Westchester Parish section of Colchester, Connecticut. Among their children were
                Stephen (1741/42-1820) and William (b. 1746). Stephen married Rachel Day. He was a
                farmer and a Captain in the Revolutionary War. Among their children was Olive
                (1778-1867). William married Lucy Day, daughter of Abraham and Irene Foote Day.
                Their children included William (b. 1773), Ezra (1777-1851) and Amaziah (1780-1841).
                Ezra married his cousin Olive Brainard and they had a daughter named Oliver
                (1803-1884). William Brainard married Patience Foote and they had children Jerusha
                (1800-1828), Nathaniel Foote Brainerd (1802-1878), and Lucy Day Brainerd
                (1804-1857). Amaziah Brainard married Huldah Foote (1791-1881), the daughter of
                Nathaniel and Abigail Foote. Amaziah was a justice of the peace and a representative
                to the General Assembly from Colchester. They had children Leverett, Albert
                (1832-1878) and Lucy Abigail (b. 1832).</p>
            <p>Nathaniel Foote (1742-1829) married three times, first to Jerusha Cadwell
                (1747-1777), then Patience Skinner (d. 1790,) and third, Abigail Foote of
                Colchester, Connecticut. Abigail was the daughter of Nathaniel’s cousin Israel
                Foote. Nathaniel’s children included Nathaniel (1779-1799), Patience (1783-1859) who
                married William Brainard, Huldah who married Amaziah Brainard, and Israel (b. 1794).
                Abigail Foote Brainard’s sister Elizabeth (1750-1845) married Reverend David
                Huntington (1745-1812).</p>
            <p>The collection folder has pages from both the Foote and Brainerd family histories to
                provide additional information on the relationships between the two families. </p>

            <p> The donor originally arranged the collection by type of document. They are now
                arranged by generation and then by family. For example, William Brainard, the son of
                Stephen comes after his father and his older brother Stephen. William’s children and
                then grandchildren follow.</p>
            <p>The earliest records in the collection are deeds for land in Colchester bought and
                sold by brothers Daniel and Stephen Brainard. Huldah Foote Brainard is represented
                by a diary she probably kept as a girl, a commonplace book with notes and essays on
                a variety of topics, correspondence, and some verse that she apparently wrote. She
                also is named in a deed with her son Albert, 1854. Huldah’s daughter Lucy Abigail
                Brainerd wrote the Brainerd family genealogy. Her limited papers include some
                correspondence, that in 1908 about the publication of her book, and a series of
                printed poems with annotations that her grandmother used to recite them to her.</p>
            <p>Ezra, Jabez and Nathaniel F. Brainerd are represented by family correspondence dating
                from 1819-1829. Olive Brainerd, the daughter of Olive and Ezra Brainerd, moved with
                her family to Hamilton, NY. She received letters from her cousins Jerusha, Lucy Day
                and Olive Brainerd filled with family and community news. These were transcribed and
                the typescripts bound by Newton C. Brainerd.</p>
            <p>Among papers belonging to assorted members of the Brainerd family are some receipts
                and notes and two marriage records accompanied by a handwritten statement that they
                were received from a Mr. George H. Loveland, grandson of Eleazer and Lois Dunham of
                Colchester. Homer W. Brainard evidently gave these assorted papers to Lucy A.
                Brainerd, knowing she was working on a family history.</p>
            <p>Israel Foote kept up correspondence with his sisters even after their marriages. They
                date from 1815-1866. Newton C. Brainerd thought they were important enough to make a
                typescript, which he then had bound. Elizabeth Foote Huntington has two incoming
                letters, 1774 and undated and two fragments of verse dated 1772. Her husband David
                traveled a great deal and maintained contact with his family through his
                correspondence, 1793-1811.</p>
            <p>Seemingly unrelated is a folder of material concerning the Bulkeley family. There is
                an 1840 writ, and then several lists, ca. 1850 of family members. These may have
                been compiled by Lucy A. Brainerd.</p>
            <p>Of particular note among the unrelated papers at the end of the collection is an
                eight page narrative of a voyage on the Connecticut River. It was part of the gift
                of Newton C. Brainerd and accompanied the diaries of Abigail and Elizabeth Foote.
                Since it could not be attributed to either girl, the narrative was added to the
                family papers. </p>
