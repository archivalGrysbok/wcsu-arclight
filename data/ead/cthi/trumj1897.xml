      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>James Hammond Trumbull was born on December 20, 1821 to Gurdon and Sarah Ann (Swan)
                Trumbull of Stonington, Connecticut. He received his preparatory education at
                Tracy's Academy and entered Yale College in 1838. He never took a degree, however,
                because he withdrew after two years for reasons of poor health. Nevertheless,
                Trumbull became a noted philologist, historian, and bibliographer.</p>
      <p>One of Trumbull's first academic projects was assisting James Harvey Linsley in
                cataloguing the mammalia, reptiles, birds, shells, and fish of the state of
                Connecticut. Following this, in 1847, he was appointed assistant secretary of state
                for Connecticut. After spending a few years as state librarian and registrar, he was
                again assistant secretary of state in 1858. In 1861 he was elected secretary of
                state on the Republican ticket, and he retained this post until 1866, from which
                year Trumbull worked full time as a librarian at Hartford's Watkinson Library of
                Reference. His involvement with that institution continued, and in 1890 he was
                appointed librarian emeritus. </p>
      <p>Trumbull's historical contributions were many. While assistant secretary of state, in
                1850, he compiled and published The Public Records of the Colony of Connecticut,
                Prior to the Union with New Haven Colony, May 1665. He published subsequent volumes
                covering the period from 1665-1677, and finally one covering the years 1678-1689.
                Other work of Trumbull's on Connecticut history includes his 1876 publication of The
                True-Blue Laws of Connecticut and New Haven and the False-Blue Laws Invented by the
                Rev. Samuel Peters. </p>
      <p>Perhaps Trumbull's best-known work was that on Indian languages, including an 1865
                translation of John Eliot's catechism for the Indians, and several journal articles
                on Indian languages. </p>
      <p>Trumbull died in Hartford on August 5, 1897, following a brief illness. He was
                survived by his wife, Sarah A. (Robinson) Trumbull, whom he married in 1855, and a
                daughter, Annie Eliot Trumbull. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>Collection consists largely of correspondence, letters, and supporting material
                written in both personal and professional roles. Such correspondence is arranged
                chronologically. Much of the correspondence is from Trumbull's tenure as trustee and
                librarian of the Watkinson Library. Of particular interest are Trumbull's notes on
                Indian places names, as well as those on Indian languages and on hieroglyphics. Some
                notable correspondents include William Buckingham, Franklin Dexter, George Moore,
                Charles Sedgewick, Samuel Wolcott, Samuel Clemens, Gideon Welles, Timothy Dwight,
                and John Langdon Sibley.</p>
