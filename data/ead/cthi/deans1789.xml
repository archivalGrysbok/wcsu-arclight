      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p> Silas Deane was born December 24, 1737 in Ledyard, CT, son of Silas Dean (sic), a blacksmith
    and land speculator, and Sarah Barker Dean, formerly of Marshfield, MA. Following his 1758
    graduation from Yale College, Deane taught school in Hartford and read for the bar. One of his
    pupils was Edward Bancroft, later a notorious doctor turned British agent, who served as
    Secretary to the American Commission in Paris. </p>
      <p>Deane met his first wife, Mehitable Webb, while settling the estate of her late husband,
    Joseph Webb. Deane and Mehitable Webb married in 1763. They had one son, Jesse. Mehitable Deane
    died in 1767. Three years later Deane married Elizabeth Saltonstall, granddaughter of a governor
    and daughter of a general. Through his marriages Deane gained financial security and earned
    social prominence in Wethersfield. He pursued his legal profession but was engaged chiefly as a
    merchant and West Indian trader. </p>
      <p>Deane was active in his community's church and represented Wethersfield for several terms in
    the Connecticut Assembly. He participated enthusiastically in the protests against British
    commercial policy. As Secretary of the Connecticut Committee of Correspondence, Deane attended
    meetings and conventions to discuss ways of expressing the colonies' complaints. In 1774 the
    Connecticut Committee of Correspondence appointed Deane, Roger Sherman and Eliphalet Dyer as
    delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. In this position Deane served on 40
    committees, being especially effective on the naval committee and as chairman of ways and means.
    He disliked his fellow delegate, Roger Sherman, and their incongeniality later hurt Deane as
    Sherman opposed him politically. Deane orchestrated the financial backing for the daring capture
    of Fort Ticonderoga. </p>
      <p>In Fall 1775 delegates to the Continental Congress were elected rather than appointed, and
    Sherman's organization defeated Deane. Deane had made such an impression in Philadelphia,
    however, that he was chosen by the Committee on Secrecy to procure supplies as Congress' agent
    to France. Additionally, Deane was chosen by the Committee on Secret Correspondence to promote a
    treaty of alliance. He departed March 16, 1776 and arrived at Bordeaux in May. In addition to
    his official duties, Deane had private business assignments with the Morris, Willing Company of
    Philadelphia and for his own family enterprises. Deane was to purchase supplies and materiel for
    Congress with money or credit from the sale of American commodities in Europe. He was to receive
    a commission of 5%. It was a daunting situation for Deane who did not have any contacts and did
    not speak French.</p>
      <p> Deane established a relationship with Hortalez and Cie, a firm devised by the French
    government as a cover for trade with the colonies. The firm was headed by Caron de Beaumarchais.
    Through this and other deals, Deane managed to ship supplies and guns to Portsmouth, New
    Hampshire. The supplies arrived in time to assure the victory at Saratoga. This in turn
    convinced the French to sign a treaty of alliance. Congress had created an American Commission
    at Paris to supersede its individual agent. Deane was named a Commissioner along with Benjamin
    Franklin and Arthur Lee. The three signed the treaty of alliance Feb. 6, 1778. In March, Deane's
    enemies in Congress and the friends and family of Arthur Lee, his antagonistic fellow
    commissioner in Paris, demanded his recall to report on the situation in Europe and account for
    funds spent. Deane would have preferred to postpone his return but, on the advice of Franklin,
    sailed on D'Estaing's flagship with Conrad A. Gerard, the first French minister to the United
    States. They arrived in Philadelphia in July.</p>
      <p>Congress then proceeded to ignore Deane's efforts to meet, make his report, and present his
    accounts for payment. He had used many of his own funds for the government's business and
    commissions were owed him, but Deane was thought to have misused government funds for his own
    interest. As time passed and Deane became aware that his enemies in Congress were humiliating
    him, he grew impatient and wrote a public statement which was taken up by the press. Congress
    resented this action. During the year in which Deane waited on Congress he was nominated for a
    seat in the upper house of the Connecticut legislature but did not serve. In August 1779
    Congress offered him $10,000 in depreciated currency which he refused. He was determined to
    return to France to collect the vouchers needed to substantiate his claims. After attending to
    family commercial business in Virginia, Deane returned to France in March 1780 as a private
    citizen.</p>
      <p>In Paris Franklin was supportive and hospitable. Deane prepared his accounts, but again,
    Congress delayed reviewing them. Congress had appointed Thomas Barclay, the Consul at Paris, to
    the task but claimed he had not the authority to settle them. Deane moved to Ghent to save money
    and avoid imposing on Franklin. Deane's health and fortunes deteriorated and his morale suffered
    keenly at the frustration of the delays. Eventually he moved to England and lived for a while on
    the charity of friends, among them Dr. Edward Bancroft, the erstwhile secretary of the American
    Commissioners in Paris, whose role as a double agent for the British would not be revealed until
    about 1870. Deane received discouraging reports from friends at home, Robert Morris among them,
    about the almost total erosion of the currency and the fiscally irresponsible Congress. In his
    own despondency he came to think a negotiated settlement of the war was advisable and wrote in
    this vein to friends, perhaps conniving at the interception of the letters by the British. They
    were published by the Tory publicist in New York, Rivington, and caused an outcry of treason. At
    the nadir of his fortunes and perspective on the war, Deane was unaware that with the
    intervention of the French navy, the military balance changed quickly and, as the Rivington
    letters appeared, Cornwallis's surrender was imminent.</p>
      <p> Deane longed to return home but his loyal brother, Barnabas, warned he would not be accepted
    at that time. Remaining in London, Silas Deane explored many ideas for the promotion of post-war
    Anglo American commerce. Of special interest was a scheme for a canal between the St. Lawrence
    and Lake Champlain which he discussed with Lord Sheffield and Lord Dorchester (Guy Carleton),
    the Governor-General of Canada. Full of hope for such prospects, he borrowed money to board ship
    at Deal on September 23, 1789. However, before sailing Deane suffered a violent abdominal attack
    which caused paralysis and death. Suspicions of poisoning by Dr. Bancroft, an authority on
    poisons, have not been proved. He was buried at Deal. Barnabas later thanked and reimbursed a
    kind American, Theodore Hopkins, who attended to the interment of the body. In 1795 Deane's son,
    Jesse Deane, was to receive proceeds from the sale of his father's diamond encrusted gold snuff
    box.</p>
      <p>Silas Deane's granddaughter and only heir, Philura Deane Alden and her husband, Horatio Alden
    of Hartford, prepared a Memorial to Congress in 1835 documenting Silas Deane's claims for money
    owed him by the government. The Memorial contains accounts and important documents such as
    Lafayette's commission. In 1842 both houses awarded the heirs $37,000, a partial restitution,
    and described the original audit by a Congressional Committee under the chairmanship of his old
    enemy, Arthur Lee, as "ex parte, erroneous and a gross injustice to Silas Deane."</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The Silas Deane papers in The Connecticut Historical Society were acquired in different lots
    at different times in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Most were donated by Isabel
    Alden Thomas, the great- granddaughter of Silas Deane and last direct heir. Some were printed in
    Volumes II and XXIII of the Society's Collections, some microfilmed and some not reproduced at
    all. The 1835 Memorial to Congress by Philura Deane Alden and Horatio Alden was acquired from
    the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1875. The bound volume containing the manuscripts of the
    Memorial which included the correspondence of Robert Morris, Caron de Beaumarchais, the Compte
    de Vergennes and other notables of the period, the original commissions of LaFayette and DeKalb
    and Silas Deane's own accounts prepared and presented to Congress, was found on May 15, 1871 in
    the waste paper bin of the Register's File Room of the Treasury and retrieved by a clerk, D.S.
    Green. It was acquired by the Society through the efforts of J. Hammond Trumbull and Charles
    Hoadley.</p>
      <p>The collection consists predominately of correspondence, personal and business. Notable
    correspondents include: Robert Morris, Caron de
     Beaumarchais, the Compte de Vergennes, Jonathan
     Trumbull, Benjamin Gale, Oliver Ellsworth
    and William Drayton.</p>

    secretary or the secretaries of his correspondents. There are several photocopies from other
    collections. The number of items listed for each folder represents the number of pieces of
    paper, rather than the number of letters or entities.</p>
