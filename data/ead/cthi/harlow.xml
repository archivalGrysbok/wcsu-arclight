      <p>Augustine Harlow, a native of Maine, was born to Isaac Harlow and his wife approximately
                1833. The Harlows also had a daughter, Flora E. Harlow (born September 1836), who
                would marry Charles A. Barry in 1868. Augustine Harlow was commissioned on 16 April
                1852 to serve in Company A, First Regiment Infantry, First Brigade, First Division
                of the Massachusetts Militia and was discharged of his own request after attaining
                the rank of Captain in July 1859. The Federal Census lists him as a printer in
                Boston in 1860. Harlow served in the Civil War, mustering in and being commissioned
                in Boston on 16 July 1861. He later received a disability discharge and was mustered
                out of service on 3 August 1863. By 1880 Harlow had settled in Hartford, employed as
                a Clerk for the Adam's Express Company.</p>
      <p>Ella Ritner (also called Ellie), was born in Pennsylvania to Abram and Mary W. Ritner
                ca. 1852. Ella had at least two sisters, Laura F. "Loll" Ritner (b. 1840), who
                married Francis B. Ripley (b. 1818); and Emma Jane (b. 1850). Ella Ritner married
                Augustine Harlow and the couple had five children: Bessie (born in March 1873), Mary
                E. (born ca. 1873), Albert F. (21 March 1886-April 1966), Flora R. (born ca. 1876)
                and Anna (born in April 1888). Following Augustine's death, the family moved to
                Bridgeport. It was while living there that Ella began to receive Augustine's
                military pension. It is unknown when Ella died, but her family seems to have moved
                away from Connecticut. Settling in South Orange, New Jersey, Albert F. Harlow
                became an accountant for a steamship company. He and his wife, Anne, had a son named
                Thompson Ritner "Tom" Harlow (16 September 1915- 14 July 1995). Albert F. Harlow
                came to possess the collection of his family’s correspondence and donated it to the
                CHS, where Tom Harlow served as Director and Director Emeritus for over forty
                years.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>This collection has been divided into two series: <emph altrender="bold">Correspondence</emph> and <emph altrender="bold">Related Papers</emph>. Within
                each series, papers have been organized according to individual family members.
                Folders have been arranged chronologically by birth date from oldest to youngest,
                with the exception of the large number of letters produced daily between Augustine
                and Ella Harlow, which have been filed at the end of the Correspondence series.
                Within each folder, items have been arranged chronologically and most folders
                contain correspondence both written and received by the specific couple or family
                member. Items with no dates have been filed in the back of the folders.</p>
      <p>The majority of this collection is family correspondence with the bulk of the
                material comprising letters, practically written daily, between Augustine and Ella
                Harlow. The letters are in chronological order. The couple mainly discussed their
                budding relationship (and later marriage), as well as life at home in Hartford,
                Connecticut and Weston, Massachusetts. There are several letters between Augustine and Ella which contain pressed flowers and have been placed in archival storage
                bags.</p>
      <p>Flora E. Barry’s correspondence describes the personal and very heart-wrenching
                accounts of a woman and her family troubled by an abusive and slandering husband.
                The letters trace the start of Flora’s unhappiness and unease and eventually show
                how her career and personal life were almost destroyed by her husband’s 
                accusations. Fearing the then lawful charge of desertion, Flora fought her case in
                court, won, and continued her singing career throughout New England. </p>
      <p>The letters of Emma Jean Ritner mention local incidents of rape and sexual assault as
                well as instances of childhood injury. Many family members reference the Boston Fire
                of 1872 as well as their views towards local home life, travel, sickness, holidays
                and politics. </p>
