      <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
      <p>Samuel Arnold, a resident of Haddam, Connecticut, and a Democrat, was elected to the
                U.S. Congress in 1857. In addition, he served as president of the Bank of East
                Haddam; he owned two sailing vessels, the Schooners J. Cone and James McCloskey; he
                served as an agent for the town fund; and he ran a farm. The Company of J &amp; GC
                Arnold operated a quarry in Haddam. </p>
    </bioghist>

      <head>Scope and Content</head>
      <p>The collection consists of eight account books arranged in chronological order. All
                but one of the volumes document the activities of Samuel Arnold. These activities
                include trade in textiles, stone, timber and foodstuffs and services such as
                dressing cloth at the Buckley &amp; Arnold factory, framing a barn, or carting men
                and material for the new courthouse. He noted when he lent or borrowed cash, what
                New Year’s presents he gave family members, and the execution of several land
                transactions, some involving land in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
      <p>The earliest volume dates from 1824-1836. Starting in the next volume, dated 1856,
                Arnold made notes about daily activities. He mentioned trips he made to New York,
                Philadelphia and Chicago, noted visits to the theater, documented when he made court
                appearances and attended political conventions, and he noted particularly severe
                weather. He also mentions sending a horse to a racetrack. In 1867, he noted paying
                for music lessons for Anna, and remarked on his daughter (Anna?) attending Miss
                Payne’s School in Middletown.</p>
      <p> Arnold’s interest in politics is demonstrated through entries in which he described
                town meetings, presidential, state and local elections, a Buchanan Festival on
                January 15, 1857, meetings of the State Central Committee, the Democratic
                Congressional Convention, his own election to Congress in 1857, and a Washington
                birthday supper. Unfortunately, volumes covering his term in Congress are not part
                of this collection; there is a gap between 1857 and 1864. On a local level, Arnold
                was also involved in presenting several petitions from the town to the state
                legislature protesting plans to move the county courthouse and jail to Middletown. </p>
      <p> In 1864, he noted three instances of assisting someone in purchasing a substitute
                for the U.S. Army. These occurred on August 3, November 1, and December 11,
                1864.</p>
      <p> The one volume not exclusively belonging to Samuel Arnold records the labor accounts
                and trade of J and GC Arnold &amp; Co., from 1827-1837. The firm operated a quarry
                in Haddam and the owners recorded the number of days individuals worked for the
                company or boarded with the family. The company delivered stone for building the new
                courthouse and there are other notations for loading ships and drawing stones.
                Scattered among the expenses for the company are some personal accounts.</p>
