            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>Jedidiah Huntingtonwas born on August 4, 1743 in Norwich, Connecticut to Jabez
                Huntington and his first wife Elizabeth (Backus) Huntington. Huntington graduated
                from Harvard College in 1763 and joined his father in his profitable West India
                trading company later that year. Huntington married Faith Trumbull daughter of the
                Governor of Connecticut, Jonathan Trumbull, and Faith (Robinson) Trumbull on May 1,
                1766.</p>

            <p>Huntington began his military career in 1769 when he was appointed to ensign of the
                First Norwich Company. He quickly rose through the ranks and by the outbreak of the
                War was colonel of the 20th Regiment of Colonial Militia. He continued in the rank
                of colonel with the 8th Connecticut Regiment (1775), the 17th Regiment of
                Connecticut Infantry (1776), and the 1st Connecticut Regiment (1777). In May of 1777
                Huntington was commissioned to brigadier general in the Continental Army, and by the
                war's end was brevetted as major-general. </p>

            <p>Huntington was a member of the courts martial investigating the conduct of General
                Charles Lee, and appeared also in the Court of Enquiry to try the case of Major
                Andre. At West Point he was instrumental in organizing the Society of Cincinnati. He
                retired from the army in September of 1783.</p>


            <p>On his return to Norwich, Jedidiah was appointed Alderman, and was drawn into many
                civic roles. He was appointed State Treasurer (1786), member of the Connecticut
                Assembly (1786), Sheriff of New London County (1788), and Probate for the district
                of Norwich. In 1789 he was appointed Collector of Revenues for the port of New
                London by George Washington, and with the first elections under the Constitution
                served as a Presidential Elector.</p>


            <p>In less political roles, Huntington was deacon of the First Church of New London, a
                member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, director of the
                Connecticut Bible Society and honorary member of the Massachusetts Humane
                Society.</p>

            <p>His wife, Faith Huntington, witnessed the Battle of Bunker hill while traveling to
                see her husband in Roxbury. The trauma led to her sudden death. Huntington's second
                wife was Anne Moore, daughter of a New York businessman.</p>

            <p>Huntington died on September 25, 1818 in New London, his remains were interred in
                Norwich.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>Collection consists solely of Correspondence. The core of the collection is derived
                from three volumes kept by Jabez Huntington in which he kept his sons' letters.
                Jedidiah Huntington is the most prolific writer, and it is from that the supplied
                title proper is arranged. Other material added to the collection during subsequent
                accessions has been interfiled chronologically.</p>

            <arrangement>
                <head>Arrangement</head>
                <p>Materials are organized into three series; Series I based on previously
                    constructed order, and Series II and III based on provenance.</p>

                <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Letters to Jabez Huntington</emph> consists of
                    Letters written to Jabez Huntington by his sons, Jedidiah, Zachariah, Ebeneezer
                    and Joshua. The majority are written by Jedidiah, after whom the collection
                    derives its supplied title proper. The correspondence, originally in three
                    volumes, has been deconstructed into 15 folders, arranged chronologically, into
                    which other Jedidiah material has been inserted.</p>
                <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Francis Gilman Transcripts</emph> Consists of
                    transcriptions of letters written by Jedidiah Huntington between 1760 and 1781.
                    Many are transcriptions of letters actually housed in other collections at the
                    CHS. Transcriptions seems to have been written at the turn of the century.</p>
                <p><emph render="bold">Series III: Cedric Robinson Transcripts</emph> Consists of
                    Transcripts of nine letters written by Jedidiah Huntington between 1777 and
                    1813.</p>

                <p>Collection is constructed from three volumes of correspondence written to Jabez
                    Huntington by his sons, the majority from Jedidiah. Jedidiah, being the most
                    famous of the sons, had the collection named after him. Subsequent to the
                    renaming of Jabez's material, other material, the provenance of Joshua or
                    Jedidiah, was inserted in chronological order.</p>
