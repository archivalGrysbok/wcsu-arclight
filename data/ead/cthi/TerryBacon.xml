            <p>Nathaniel Terry, the progenitor of the families in this collection, married Catharine
                Wadsworth Terry of Hartford, Connecticut. They had eight children who lived to
                adulthood. Henry Wadsworth Terry (b. 1799), a landscape gardener who lived in

                remained until his death. He was a noted author and theologian. A detailed account
                of his professional accomplishments can be found in the book Michael Bacon of
                Dedham, 1640, and his descendants by Thomas W. Baldwin (Cambridge, Mass., 1915). The
                youngest child of the family was Frances Ellen (1816-1876) who married George
                Brinley Jr.</p>
            <p>Henry Wadsworth Terry and his wife Anna had two daughters: Rose, a noted writer of
                prose and poetry, who married Rollin Cooke; and Alice (1831-1877) who married Howard
                S. Collins, a farmer in Collinsville, Conn. Leonard and his first wife Lucy Johnson
                had nine children: Rebecca Taylor Bacon (1826-1878) a noted educator; Benjamin

                (1841-1854); and Edward Woolsey Bacon (1843-1887), who served on board David
                Farragut’s flagship Hartford, commanded two “colored” troops in the Civil War,
                received his Yale degree in 1868, and was ordained a minister at Wolcottville, Conn.
                Leonard and his second wife Catherine Wadsworth had five children: Katherine
                Wadsworth Bacon (b. 1848) who married Eugene Smith, a prison reformer of New York
                City; Thomas Rutherford Bacon (1850-1913), Yale class of 1873 and minister in
                Indiana, Connecticut and California; Alfred Terry Bacon (1852-1901) Yale class of
                1873 traveled in the West Indies and Europe before settling in Colorado where he
                raised cattle; Ellen Brinley Bacon (b. 1856) who married Henry Burke Closson; and
                Alice Mabel (1858-1918) who taught at the Hampton Institute, Virginia and in Tokyo,
                Japan and who was the founder of Dixie Hospital, Hampton, Virginia for training
                African-American nurses.</p>
            <p>Additional information on the Bacon family can be found in Michael Bacon of Dedham,
                1640, and his descendants by Thomas W. Baldwin (Cambridge, Mass., 1915), located in
                the CHS library reading room.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The correspondence in this collection is arranged alphabetically by name of
                recipient, with a few exceptions, which will be noted below.</p>
            <p>Alfred Terry Bacon, called “Taff” by his siblings, received letters from his
                siblings, most notably one from bother George in Hong Kong in 1856, where George
                reported he just bought a “box of monkeys” made by a Chinaman. Brother Thomas, at
                school in Andover, wrote about his teachers and the books he was reading. </p>
            <p>Alice Bacon’s most significant letter is one written by J.R. Hawley on U.S. Senate
                stationery, which introduced her to Dr. Walter Wyman, Supervising Surgeon General,
                Marine Hospital Services, Washington, DC.</p>
            <p>Catherine Terry Bacon received regular letters from her children. Of note are
                descriptions of life in Galveston from son Francis, letters from husband Leonard
                while he was travelling in Europe and the Middle East, childhood letters from Thomas
                who was first visiting in Colebrook, Conn. and then at school in Andover, Mass., and
                urgent letters from Theodore who was experiencing some family strife while in
                Clarkson, NY. He also wrote in 1862 while in an army camp, complaining about his
                servant. Other correspondents include cousin Sarah Terry Carrington of Colebrook,
                Conn.; nieces Alice Terry Collins and Rose Terry Cooke; daughter Katherine Smith;
                and her mother and father. </p>
            <p>Francis Bacon’s correspondence has been distributed among the recipients with the
                exception of three letters, all from Galveston, addressed to “Dear Doctor”, “Dear
                Sister” and “Dear George”, relatively anonymous greetings that could not be assigned
                to a specific individual, ca. 1853, 1855.</p>
            <p>Leonard Bacon’s letters include those from his associates and extended family, from
                his children, one from Edward Everett, two from Noah Webster, and several letters
                from his son George who was on board the U.S.S. Portsmouth sailing to Barbados and
                China, and from his daughter Rebecca. His papers also include the following printed
                material: a hymn written for the bicentennial of the founding of New Haven, 1838, “A
                Letter from the Rev. Leonard Bacon, D.D., to the Church and Congregation under his
                charge”, 1851; and a poem written for him on his seventieth birthday, 1872.</p>
            <p>Leonard Woolsey Bacon received letters of introduction from Rutherford B. Hayes, and
                thank you notes from Oliver Wendell Holmes and William Dean Howells, 1881-1890.
                Leonard wrote long detailed letters to his brothers while accompanying his father on
                his trip through Europe and the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Letters received by Rebecca T. Bacon include two from her brother Leonard while he
                was in Glasgow and London, from her mother, and from members of her immediate and
                extended family, 1850-1864. Two outgoing letters are addressed to Benjamin W. Bacon,
                dated 1847, and there are the final four pages of a letter to an unknown
                recipient.</p>
            <p>Thomas R. Bacon received one letter from his brother George addressed from Shanghai.
                The remainder of his papers is a selection of school essays, ca. 1864. Ellen Terry
                Brinley is represented by both incoming and outgoing correspondence to friends and
                family, 1837 and undated. Rose Terry Cooke wrote a letter in French to “Monsieur mon
                cousin” in 1854. </p>
            <p>Eugene Smith’s correspondence primarily refers to his work with the New York Prison
                Association and includes letters from Charles Dudley Warner and Samuel Clemens,
                1864-1894.</p>
            <p>Significant among Katherine W. Bacon Smith’s correspondence are a series of letters
                from Helen Miller Gould about funding for the Hampton Training School for Nurses,
                1900-1901, and letters from her siblings. 1869-1905.</p>
            <p>Leonard Bacon Smith married Simone Alibert, whom he met in France in 1919. Their
                papers include a wedding invitation, two letters from Leonard to Frederick Agate,
                and two from Simone, in French, to unidentified individuals, 1919.</p>
            <p>Adrian R. Terry received letters from his family while he spent time in Ecuador
                trying to establish a medical practice. The news from home is particularly rich,
                especially the letters from his father giving him the most up to date political
                news. Other correspondents include Americans living in South America giving Adrian
                advice on establishing himself. There are also financial records and correspondence,
                primarily with Charles Swett, concerning the medicines he purchased in New York and
                had shipped to him in Ecuador. Of note are letters from fellow doctor Ashbel Smith,
                1833-1835, whom Adrian frequently mentions in his missives home.</p>
            <p>Alfred’s incoming and outgoing family correspondence dates from 1815, ca. 1833, and
                undated.</p>
            <p>Catherine Wadsworth Terry evidently was the central figure in the Terry family. All
                of her children wrote to her when they were away from Hartford—Adrian while in
                Ecuador, Alfred while studying at Yale, 1817-1819, and while studying law in
                Litchfield, 1823-1824, from Charles when he was still in New York and then after his
                relocation to Cleveland, Ohio; several letters from Charles’ wife Julia; from
                Catherin’s husband, Nathaniel Terry; and from her brother and sister-in-law Daniel
                and Faith Wadsworth.</p>
            <p>Charles A. Terry is represented by incoming and outgoing correspondence, plus a
                memorial card issued at his death in 1872. </p>
            <p>Nathaniel Terry received letters from his son Adrian while he was in South America.
                Alfred reports to his father how his studies at Yale progress and about his
                exploration of musical composition. Alfred also wrote regularly while in Litchfield.
                Nathaniel’s wife Catherine and his daughter Ellen keep him apprised of daily
                activities while he is away from home. Daniel Wadsworth received letters from nephew
                Adrian in Guayaquil, Ecuador. </p>
            <p>Printed materials probably belonged to family members and include a Harriet Beecher
                Stowe pamphlet and a gift acknowledgement given to Theodore Dwight Woolsey,
                president of Yale College, 1869. The last few folders in the collection are family
                letters that lack enough information to attribute them to anyone in particular, and
                letters that do not seem to be related to the family. Further analysis may reveal
                hidden connections. Among the family papers is an agreement between Jeremiah
                Wadsworth and Noah Webster, Jr. about leasing a brick house in Hartford, 1789.</p>
            <p>Related items in the museum include dresses of Lucy Bacon and Rebecca T. Bacon,
                1960.21.1, 2, and a silhouette portrait of Nathaniel Terry, 1843.34.5</p>
