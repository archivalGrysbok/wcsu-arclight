            <p>Isaac Bronson of Winchester, Connecticut (22 Jan 1776 - 13 Jan 1849), married Eliza
                Hills on September 18, 1800. They had seven children including Theron (20 March 1809
                - 20 Jan 1873). </p>
            <p>Levi Munsill was born in Newfield, Connecticut and resided in Winchester and
                Torrington (9 Sep 1775 - 1 May 1883). He married Rachel Marshall (b.19 June 1781) on
                December 19, 1799. They had six children including Marcus (13 Oct 1800 - 12 Nov
                1885), Serepta (28 Dec 1803 - 1877), Hiram (28 May 1809 - 9 Aug 1841), and Maria
                Rachel (b. 28 Apr 1819).</p>
            <p>Theron Bronson, son of Isaac, married Maria Rachel Munsill, daughter of Levi, on July
                7, 1841 and they resided in Winchester. They had five children including William M.
                (b. 9 June 1848), Elliot B. (b. 7 Aug 1858) and Carrie (b. 17 Jan 1863).</p>
            <p>Marcus Munsill, son of Levi, married Charlotte Eno and they also resided in
                Winchester. They had a daughter Anna Marie (9 Dec 1838 - 1 Mar 1873).</p>
            <p>The Reverend Ira Pettibone, from Orwell, VT (8 Sep 1801- 11 June 1889) married Louisa
                Welch (28 Mar 1801- 8 Apr 1865) on October 4, 1830 and they resided in Norfolk,
                Connecticut. Among their children were Henry Martyn (14 Apr 1838 - 1 Aug 1841) and
                Benjamin (b. 6 May 1840).</p>
            <p>Benjamin Pettibone, son of Ira, married Anna Marie Munsill, daughter of Marcus, on
                September 26, 1866. They resided in Norfolk, CT.</p>
            <p>Philomela Pettibone of Norfolk, CT, daughter of Philo and Sarah Gaylord, was born on
                13 March 1805 and died 2 February 1846. </p>
            <p>Anna M. Bronson was born in 1824 and died in 1881. </p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The Bronson and Munsill family papers contain correspondence and papers relating to
                most of the people named above. The folders have been organized by person in
                chronological order. They contain mostly letters received and written, though there
                are miscellaneous deeds, receipts, and a lock of hair.</p>
            <p>Isaac Bronson was the largest land owner in Winchester as well as a Justice of the
                Peace and Representative in the General Assembly. His papers are the most numerous.
                Many of them are letters from Levi Skinner in Vernon, NY. Mr. Skinner was acting as
                Isaac’s power of attorney in trying to sell a piece of Isaac’s land in Vernon. </p>
            <p>Isaac was a large dealer in dairy products. Bronson, Munsill and Co. sold dairy
                products around Connecticut and New York. Various letters from buyers in the 1840’s
                show haggling over prices and complaints about their cheese being “inferior” and not
                what was promised.</p>
            <p>There is one letter between the two patriarchs of this family tree—Isaac Bronson and
                Levi Munsill. In it, Isaac pledges $50 to help build the new meetinghouse in
                Newfield but expects to be repaid by the end of the third year.</p>
            <p>Marcus Munsill was a one-time school teacher in Torrington. One of his letters to his
                father relates his first days there as he boasts about how he reformed the school
                and how he has “one little lousy squaw” he keeps on a box under his desk. Marcus’
                brother Hiram moved to Philadelphia and wrote to his brother and father about his
                life there and travels among the “Dutch”. There is a touching letter from Hiram to
                Marcus where Hiram talks of learning of their father’s death from E. Bronson. In
                fact, E. Bronson had also written to Marcus to tell him he ran into Hiram and Hiram
                had not yet heard about Levi’s death. Hiram tragically met his end on the
                Mississippi River at Plump Bend Point, MS and was buried in Osceola, AR. </p>
            <p>Though Hiram died in August of 1841, it must have been under unusual circumstances.
                His mother Rachel received a letter dated February 9, 1842 from C.L. Packard asking
                about the rumors of Hiram’s death at Plumb Point Bend and hoping it was not
                true.</p>
            <p>Serepta Munsill never married but her folder is full of letters, particularly to two
                sisters, Esther and Emeline.</p>
            <p>Louisa Welch Pettibone’s sons were quite successful. One letter to her friend “Mrs.
                W.” mentions Louisa’s son Asa “accepting the offer at Norfolk”. In fact, he became
                the first Cashier of Norfolk bank and afterwards it’s President. Another son, Ira
                Welch Pettibone, graduated Yale and was Colonel of the Tenth Regiment Connecticut
                Volunteers during the Civil War. Louisa’s folder contains a wrapped up lock of her
                son Henry Martyn Pettibone’s hair for “his dear grandma”. Sadly, Henry died at only
                three years of age.</p>
            <p>Philomela Pettibone could not be fit into the family tree but her folder contains
                letters she received from friends and cousins. She attended Andover Theological
                Seminary and one of her letters from there mentions the infamous 1837 murder of the
                Reverend E. P. Lovejoy saying “this death will accomplish more for abolition than
                his life.”</p>
            <p>Theron Bronson’s sons William and Elliot began the Bronson Brothers, a lumber
                company. A letter from Elliot to a younger sibling is written on Bronson Brothers’
                stationary. Their sister Carrie received letters from friends and an invitation to a
                party in town, though there is no hint she would end up being committed. The 1910
                census shows her being an inmate at Ward 7 in Hartford, a forerunner to the
                Institute of Living. </p>
            <p>Anna M. Bronson of Winchester could not be fit into the family tree but there are
                letters referencing her as a teacher. It’s believed she is the same Anna M. Bronson
                who became the first “lady principal” of the Elmira Female College at Elmira, NY.
                She served in that position from 1858 until her death in 1881. Now Elmira College,
                there was a plaque dedicated to her hanging in a chapel in Cowles Hall. </p>
