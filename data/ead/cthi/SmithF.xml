            <head>Biographical Sketch</head>
            <p>Frank Smith (b. ca. 1896) was the son of John and Annie Smith of New London,
                Connecticut. The family home was at 60 Denison Street. His older brother James
                married and lived in the same home. In 1918, Frank either enlisted or was drafted
                into the U.S. Army. He served state-side with the Quartermaster’s Corps at camps in
                New York, Washington, DC, Maryland, and Ohio before being discharged in March 1919.
                His father John died in January 1919, while Frank was still away from home. Frank
                was a machinist. He later married Anna and had a son Frank, who then served in the
                army during World War II.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p> The collection primarily consists of the letters written to Frank Smith while he was
                in the army. Evidently Frank was a bit of a ladies’ man. Many of his letters are
                from young women, including Genevieve from Boston, Mabel from New Bedford, Mass.,
                Helen Green of New London, and Ruth of Washington, DC. While stationed at Fort Mead,
                Maryland, and Fort Meigs in Washington, DC, Frank met and started wooing Elizabeth
                Martin. Numerous letters from her to Frank (and to his mother) are in the
                collection. Other letters are from cousins and aunts in New Jersey and New London,
                including Margaret Schrader and Tess (last name unknown). He also received letters
                from some of his co-workers from J.N. Lapointe Co., who addressed him by the
                nickname “Smoke”. All of these letters are arranged chronologically. </p>
            <p> Separated from the general correspondence to Frank are those from his mother, who
                pined for her younger son and expressed her fears he would be sent overseas. Most of
                her letters describe how much she missed him. She mentions various love affairs in
                town, names those who had gone into the army, relates family feuds, and celebrates
                the birth of her first grandchild. During 1918, she frequently mentions the number
                of people in New London who are ill with the flu, and the numbers who were dying.
                She also mentions the parade in town when peace was declared in November 1918. Annie
                also cautions Frank against getting married while he is away. One unique entry
                describes her physical complaints to her “change of life”. </p>
            <p> Only a few of the letters written by Frank to his mother survive. They indicate
                Frank was a rather responsible fellow, although he liked a good time. These are
                followed in the collection by letters written to Annie Smith, Frank’s mother, by
                relatives and friends, and to Anna Smith, Frank’s wife. </p>
