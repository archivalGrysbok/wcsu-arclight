<head>Biography</head>
    <p>Tom Stevens (1901-1982) lived in Deep River, Connecticut. He graduated from Northeastern University and worked as an electrical engineer at the Boston Edison Company until 1942. He served in World War II as a Commander in the Navy and was active in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres of Operations. After the war he served as the Managing Director of the Marine Historical Association at Mystic (later known as Mystic Seaport) until 1949. He returned to Deep River to form the Deep River Hardware Corporation which he ran until 1970. He was Town Clerk of Deep River from 1949 to 1951 and Chairman of the Town’s Board of Finance for the following six years. He was also a Director of the Deep River Savings Bank and a past President of Northeastern University Alumni Association. In 1955 he initiated legislation which established the Connecticut Historical Commission and he was the first member of the Commission appointed by Governor Ribbicoff and served on this Commission for the next twelve years. He assisted in the formation of many historical societies and served as the vice-president of the Connecticut League of Historical Societies (now CLHO).</p> 
        
       <p> Stevens descended from a long line of ship captains which established a lifelong interest in maritime history, particularly shipbuilding, ship captains, and history of the Connecticut River. He collected material relating to the history of the lower River Valley and established a substantial library and archives in support of his scholarly interests. He was a frequent writer of historical topics which appeared in local newspapers and he lectured frequently throughout Connecticut. He was a founder of the Connecticut River Museum.
