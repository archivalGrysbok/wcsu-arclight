<head>Biography</head>
    <p>George L. Cheney (1857–1933) was the son of George Arthur Cheney and Sarah Bucklin Greene Cheney. When G. L. Cheney was three years old his parents moved to Essex and his father became a partner (and later President) in the ivory manufacturing concern of Comstock, Cheney &amp; Co. Comstock, Cheney was one of several Connecticut companies using ivory in the manufacture of novelty items (billiard balls, hair combs, toothpicks, game pieces, etc.) as well as piano keys. This competitive industry saw the eventual merging of several smaller local companies (George Read &amp; Co., Pratt Brothers Company, Julius Pratt and Company) with Comstock, Cheney. In the 1930s, Comstock, Cheney merged with their competitor, Pratt, Read &amp; Company.</p>
        
    <p>George L. and Harriet Carnes Cheney had four daughters, the youngest named Harriet. Harriet Cheney (1895–1987) married Augustus C. Downing, a New York banker and lived in both New York and Essex during her lifetime.

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
    <p>The papers relating to George L. Cheney pertain to his business, family, and charitable interests dating from 1894-1936.  Among the items in the collection are documents related to the family business. These concern the operation of a manufacturing enterprise, including: procurement of raw materials, product transportation, advertising, sales, weights, and investments. Non-business material includes requests for donations from many different charities.</p>
    <p>Harriet Cheney Downey’s papers deal largely with family, financial and property concerns. She maintained the housekeeping accounts for her homes in New York and Essex as well as her family&apos;s charitable contributions.  She also received regular income from shares in her family's company. After the death of her parents, Harriet and her sisters had the task of selling the New York City properties and there is much correspondence about that endeavor.</p>
