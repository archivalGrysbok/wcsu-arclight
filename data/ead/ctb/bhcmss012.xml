<head>Biography</head>
<p>Raymond W. Fletcher is perhaps best known as a local Bridgeport artist, self-taught and extremely prolific.  Born June 23, 1900, Fletcher's father died when Fletcher was just four, and at the age of fourteen, he dropped out of school in order to help support his family.  </p>
<p>However, dropping out of school did not conclude Fletcher's education.  In his own writings, Mr. Fletcher expressed his deep appreciation for the Bridgeport Public Library system, as he relied on the library formerly located at Main and John Streets to further his own education. This deep gratitude is what led him to donate both his homemade circus wagons and many of his paintings to the Bridgeport Public Library.  His series of paintings of Bridgeport landmarks that no longer stand, like P.T. Barnum's Iranistan and the Harral-Wheeler House, remain on display in the Bridgeport History Center.  According to Fletcher, he began painting in 1935.</p>
<p>His deep connection to Bridgeport also meant that from an early age, Fletcher was surrounded by the circus.  Bridgeport was the home of Barnum and Bailey's winter quarters, as well as the adopted city of P.T. Barnum himself.  As a result, Fletcher maintained a healthy interest in the circus all his life.  In addition to being a member of the Bridgeport Barnum Festival and the Circus Model Builders, he collected circus material.  This includes the material that makes up this collection. </p>
<p>Fletcher was a Navy veteran of World War II, and was employed by both the Underwood Company and City Lumber Company until he retired in 1969.  His wife was named Gertrude, and he had a step-daughter named Beatrice.</p>
