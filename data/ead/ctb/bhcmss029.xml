<head>Biography</head>
<p>Born on March 5, 1915 in Springfield, Massachusetts, Jack Goldring was an active member in politics within the state of Connecticut.  The family moved to Hartford in 1928, and Goldring began his college career after finishing high school.  He began at Central Connecticut College in 1934, only to transfer to Connecticut State College (later University of Connecticut) a few months later.  </p>
<p>Goldring received a BS in math and social science.  During his college days, he became a member of the Connecticut Community Party (starting in 1936) which saw him become involved in social issues of the day.  </p>
<p>After graduating, Goldring moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and began to work for General Electric.   He served in the Second World War [info], then returned to GE when the conflict concluded.  He left GE in 1947 to work for the Connecticut Communist Party, where he held numerous posts and helped organize unions.</p>
<p>In 1954, Goldring was arrested with other party members by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Smith Act.  This act allowed for prosecution of subversive activities.  Goldring was let go on a technicality, but the fight was a long one.  </p>
<p>His wife, Harriet, shared Goldring's activism including civil rights and protests against the Vietnam War.  The couple had 1 son together.</p>
<p>In addition to being active in politics, Goldring became a skilled carpenter and builder.  This led to the establishment of one of the first home inspection agencies in the state where he worked with Harriet.  Goldring was a firm believer in affordable housing for all, and this was reflected in his housing work.  He also was one of the founders of the American Society of Home Inspectors.
Outside of his activism, Jack Goldring sang in the Fairfield County and New Haven chorales, read widely, and appreciated art.  He died on February 6, 2001.</p>
