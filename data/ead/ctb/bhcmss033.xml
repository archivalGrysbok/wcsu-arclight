<head>Biography</head>
<p>Sherwood E. and Cynthia Stratton were Bridgeport natives and parents to Charles S. Stratton, later made famous by P.T. Barnum as General Tom Thumb.  They had two daughters, Mary E. and Francis Jane; the former was married first to A.S. Bassett and then to James H. Osgood.  Francis married Royal Basett, who was the head of the Birmingham Iron Foundry and also a trustee for Francis Janes mother.</p>
<p>Charles S. Stratton (January 4, 1838- July 15, 1883), known as General Tom Thumb, was an entertainer and Bridgeport Conn. native who got his start with P.T. Barnum in 1842. Stratton's parents signed him with Barnum at age 4, as exhibiting those with dwarfism was lucrative at the time. Stratton took quickly to performing, and he entertained audiences worldwide, including nobility such as Queen Victoria. Stratton married fellow performer M. Lavinia Warren and the two had a happy marriage. Stratton's performances brought him renown as a celebrity, perhaps one of the biggest at the time, and he and Warren were able to live comfortably when not working. On July 15, 1883, Stratton suffered a stroke and passed away. He is buried at Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with his wife beside him.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>Mostly within the collection are wills, deeds, financial arrangements, and estate papers.  Included are two wills from Charles himself, including one from 1860 prior to his celebrated marriage to Lavinia Warren.  Also within are legal documents and personal papers from Mary Stratton (later Osgood), one of Charles' siblings.</p>
</scopecontent>
<arrangement>
<head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Legal papers are placed first and make up the bulk of the collection.  The few pieces that are non-legal are placed at the end.  There are no formal series, as the material is too brief to warrant it.</p>
