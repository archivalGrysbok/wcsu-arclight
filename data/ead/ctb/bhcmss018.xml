<abstract label="Abstract">The Barnum Museum building has gone through various incarnations since it was first opened in 1893.  In the 1950s and 1960s, the museum collections were managed by Elizabeth Seeley (a Barnum descendent).  Elsie Beth Clark was a board member and helped create displays for the museum, as well as handouts.</abstract>

<head>Biography</head>
<p>Elsie Beth Clark was among other things, a teacher in the Bridgeport school district, an active member of the Barnum Museum and a part of its board, and the daughter of former Bridgeport mayor Frank Clark.  She was born in 1902 and began to teach in the Bridgeport school system in 1922.  During this time she also attended Columbia University and the New Haven Teacher's College.  </p>
<p>She taught at a number of Bridgeport schools, including Franklin, Madison, and Woodrow Wilson.  The grade levels she taught varied, which in turn helped her in one of her additional roles at the Barnum Museum: creating displays and handouts meant to educate visitors of all ages.  
In addition to being a part of the Barnum Museum, Clark also served as the secretary of the Bridgeport Historical Society, was a member of the Circus Historical Society as well as Circus Fans of America.</p>
<p>Miss Clark died on June 30, 1968.</p>
