Hired by the Locomobile Company of America, engineer Andrew L. Riker worked in Bridgeport for two decades His time as the chief of engineering and vice president of the Locomobile Company occurred at the same time that Bridgeport was producing seemingly everything, from heavy industrial products to small consumer goods. The papers of Andrew L. Riker and the Riker Family provide a look into how Riker himself functioned, how he worked, and what his private life was like. Materials also relate to his immediate and larger family, and help to offer a full picture of the family. Prominent within is material related to the early automobile industry, as well as family photographs and patents.</abstract><langmaterial label="Languages Represented">.</langmaterial></did><accessrestrict><head>Restrictions</head><p>Collection open for research.</p></accessrestrict><userestrict><head>Publication Rights</head><p>For copyright status, please contact the Bridgeport History Center, Bridgeport Public Library.</p></userestrict><prefercite><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>[Identification of item], , [Box no]., Bridgeport History Center, Bridgeport Public Library</p></prefercite><processinfo><head>Processing Information</head><p>The papers of the Rikers came into the Bridgeport History Center as one donation. The material was not immediately processed. Researchers frequently requested these papers along with the Records of the&#x00C2; Locomobile Company of America Records that entered the Bridgeport History Center in three different accessions from three different donors, and were intermixed. Effort was made to determine if any material from the Riker boxes was mixed in with the Locomobile Company of America records. Due to the highly similar content in both collections, judgement calls were made at several points about the likelihood of origin. The Records of the Locomobile Company of America and Riker family papers were processed simultaneously.</p></processinfo><bioghist><head>Biography</head><p>Andrew L. Riker was born on October 22, 1868 in New York City. He attended Columbia College with the intent to focus on law, but he took a keen interest in engineering. He began working within the automotive industry in 1884, and began his own company based in Elizabeth, New Jersey: the Riker Motor Vehicle Company. Also called the Riker Electric Motor Company, the manufacturer focused on building electric cars in the early days of the automotive industry.Eventually, Riker was lured to the Locomobile Company of America in 1902, which was based in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Over the course of his tenure there, he rose to the position of Vice-President of the company as well as the chief of engineering, but before that he gained recognition for developing gasoline cars for Locomobile. In 1908, the race car that he helped Locomobile to develop won the prestigious Vanderbilt Cup Race, which was given the number of 16 in the lineup. Old 16 was a major success, and represented Riker's skill in engineering and development. He also helped to develop the worm drive truck for Locomobile, which was later renamed the Riker Truck. This vehicle had a heavy presence in World War I, and the company produced a high number of the trucks for various allies in the war. Riker's professional life was marked by success. He helped to found the American Society of Automotive Engineers, and was heavily involved in a number of professional organizations.Until Locomobile began to close in the 1920s, Riker remained at the company. When Locomobile left Bridgeport, Riker retired, and settled into life in Fairfield, Connecticut. An active member of the community, he was a part of the town's planning commission.Together with his wife Edith Riker (nee Whiting) whom he married on April 9, 1890, Riker had three children: Edith W., Charlotte L., and Andrew L. Riker Junior. The family took numerous trips together, and Riker himself owned several yachts which he clearly took pride in.Andrew L. Riker died on June, 1930.The larger Riker family has been in the United States since the 1600s. There are living descendants of Andrew Riker today, and they are active in preserving their family's legacy as it relates to automotive history.</p></bioghist><scopecontent><head>Scope and Content of Collection</head><p>The Andrew L. Riker and Riker Family Papers contain an eclectic variety of materials. The bulk of the material relates directly to Andrew L. Riker himself, and charts his career in the automotive industry, with a heavy focus on the 1900s to 1920s. While there is some manuscript material, most of it relates to his professional interests and contains things he either researched or was associated with. There are materials related to his personal life, but likewise they primarily reflect involvement and interests.Represented the most after Andrew L. Riker are materials related to Andrew L. Riker, Junior. His business records are presented to some degree, but the bulk of the material is research and correspondence relating to his father's history and the Locomobile Company. There are typed manuscripts of a draft of what might have been a book, as well as index card files.</p><p>Other members of the Riker family, including Riker's children with Edith, other children, and extended family have some manuscript material present. Photographs take up a large portion of the collection. A small group relates to the professional works and endeavors of Andrew L. Riker, the rest are family photographs. These include negatives that require conservation.</p><p>Due to the complex nature of the Andrew L. Riker and Riker Family Papers, the series has been divided into three sub collections: Andrew L. Riker, the Riker Family, and Oversize. The papers of Andrew L. Riker himself have been further grouped into two sub-groups: professional materials and personal materials.</p></scopecontent><arrangement><head>Arrangement</head><p>Due to the complex nature of the Andrew L. Riker and Riker Family Papers, the series has been divided into three sub collections: Andrew L. Riker, the Riker Family, and Oversize. The papers of Andrew L. Riker himself have been further grouped into two sub-groups: professional materials and personal materials.Sub-group A begins with series I, which is composed of manuscript materials. Series II represents Riker's business ventures, and series III contains all patents issued to him. Series IV contains blueprints and drawings, and series V contains medals and ribbons Riker gained through various professional involvements over his lifetime. Series VII reflect the publications that Riker relied on to inform his own work, and series IX shows the maps he also collected as a part of his work. Series X represents clippings relating to Riker and his work, and series XI contains photographs related to his time in the automotive industry.Sub-group B collects the materials relating to Riker's private life. It contains manuscripts, material relating to his yachts, and also material relating to his death, funeral, and estate.Sub-collection B represents the material related to the rest of the Rikers. Series I contains material related to Edith L. Riker, Andrew's wife. His son, Andrew L. Riker Junior is represented in series II with a heavy emphasis on his research files and work. Edith and Andrew's daughter, Eleanor, has material represented in series III, and the rest of the family is chronicled in series IV. Series V contains photographs.Sub-collection C contains all oversize material.</p></arrangement><controlaccess><head>Indexing Terms</head><p>The following terms have been used to index the description of this collection inthe library's online public access catalog.</p><persname encodinganalog="600" role="subject">Riker, A.L.
