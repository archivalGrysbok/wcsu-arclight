         <p>Marjorie Morse was born in China in 1913 to  Dr. William Reginald Morse and Anne (Anna) Crosse Kinney Morse of Canada who were Baptist medical missionaries in China from 1909 to 1937.  Dr. Morse grew up in a large family in Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia.  Marjorie, an only child, came with her parents to the United States in 1924 and remained there for her education after her parents returned to China.  She lived with relatives and friends as she attended Newton High School in Newton, Massachusetts (graduated 1930), and Wellesley College (1930-1934), where she majored in sociology.  In 1934, she began  a three-year program for an R.N. and masters degree in nursing at the Yale School of Nursing.   In New Haven in 1934, she met Allan B. Crunden, Jr.  of Montclair, New Jersey, a  graduate of Georgetown University, and a member of the Yale School of Medicine class of 1937.  By the end of the year, she had agreed to marry him after completing her training. Crunden decided at this time that he did not like the "Yale System" with its lack of examinations, and thought that hospital training would be better in a larger city.  He returned to Montclair, where he lived with his recently widowed father, and took laboratory and  social science courses at Columbia University in the spring of 1936.  In the fall of 1936, he resumed his medical education, taking his clinical years at Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia.  Marjorie Morse continued her nursing education, much of it in hospital wards, in New Haven, West Haven, and on rotations to Rhode Island until her graduation in 1937.  Much had to be decided on where and when they could be married and who would marry them.  She was a Baptist and he a devout Catholic, she was not an American citizen, and she hoped her paents could attend.  In the end, they married in July 1937 in London in a Church of England ceremony.  Her parents were able to meet them in London on their way home from China to retirement in Lawrencetown.  The Crundens lived in Philadelphia in the school year 1937-1938 where she served as a nurse-administrator at Temple and he completed his medical degree.  The following two years, while Allan Crunden was serving hospital residency appointments in Jersey City and New York, Marjorie Crunden obtained an M.A. in education from Columbia University Teacher's College.  She served briefly as an assistant in nursing education at Columbia.  In 1940 they spent a year in Chicago with Allan Crunden's father.  Allan Crunden was called into medical service in the Air Force in World War II.  After the war, they lived in Montclair and other locations in New Jersey.  He practiced as an obstetrician, while she was active in numerous civic and charitable organizations including the Montclair Board of Education, the Essex County Board of Health, the Montclair Public Health Nursing Service, and the Community Child Study Group of Montclair, which she organized.  She was an expert tennis player and a local champion.  The Crundens had two children, Robert Morse Crunden, later a prominent professor of American Studies at University of Texas, Austin, and Joan Crunden Lewis.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection contains sparse correspondence from Marjorie Morse's parents to her; letters from Marjorie Crunden to her mother in 1940-1941; hundreds of letters written every few days from her fiancé and then husband, Allan B. Crunden, Jr., at periods when they were living apart between 1935 and 1940; letters by Marjorie Morse sent as part of a round robin to friends who graduated from Wellesley; and many letters from friends and family.  Also in the collection are Marjorie Morse's five-year diary (1932-1936), memorabilia from Newton High School, Wellesley College, and Yale School of Nursing, and miscellanea.  There is some material on Morse's training as a nurse, and considerable material, including texts of examinations, on Crunden's clinical training at Temple University School of Medicine.  Above all, the letters are a record of an upper middle class courtship in the 1930s.   The collection includes a few photos of Marjorie Morse and Allan Crunden and of their son, Robert Morse Crunden, as a baby.</p>

                  <p>This subseries contains hundreds of letters written by Allan B. Crunden, Jr. to Marjorie Morse from before their formal engagement in 1935 to periods when were married but living apart in 1938 and 1940.  Marjorie Morse met Allan Crunden, of Montclair, New Jersey, in New Haven where he was a Yale medical student (Class of 1937) and she was a student at the Yale School of Nursing. At the end of 1935, Crunden decided not to continue his medical education at Yale and instead enrolled in the fall of 1936 at Temple University School of Medicine for his clinical years. He graduated in 1938. Marjorie Morse graduated from Yale School of Nursing in 1937.  They married in July 1937.  The next batch of correspondence takes place in the summer of 1938 when Allan Crunden was taking courses at Columbia and Marjorie Crunden was visiting her parents in Canada and then serving for six weeks as a nurse for the summer program of the Institute of Euthenics at Vassar College. For the last batch of letters in 1940, Allan Crunden was doing a residency in Jersey City, New Jersey and Marjorie Crunden was living in Montclair and studying for a master's degree in education at Teacher's College, Columbia University.</p>

                     <p>Marjorie Morse met Allan Crunden in the fall of 1934 and by the early spring of 1935, she had visited his parents in Montclair. He was trying to persuade her to become engaged to him. See Box 2, folder 13.  In these letters, Allan notes that he is corresponding with Marjorie's father in China, sending him medical books and journal issues. (He continues to do this throughout the courtship.)  In the summer Allan writes from his parents' home in Montclair to Marjorie in Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia (henceforth Lawrencetown), where her father's family lived. Later letters are to Marjorie in New Haven.  One letter, 1935 October 21, suggests various disagreements.  An important letter of 1935 December 10 discusses why he wants to complete his medical studies elsewhere than at Yale where he is currently enrolled.  See also undated letters, Box 2, Folder 12.</p>

                     <p>Having graduated from Yale School of Nursing in May 1937, Marjorie Morse married Allan Crunden in London on July 10, 1937 and spent the school year 1937-1938 in Philadelphia. He completed his medical degree while she worked as a nurse-administrator at the Temple University School of Nursing. The letters from Allan Crunden to Marjorie Morse Crunden resume in June 1938 when she is visiting her parents in Lawrencetown. He sends her his grades and the "Final Examination in Senior Surgery" with Prof. Babcock.  She has been invited to serve as nurse at the six-week summer program for children of the Vassar College, Summer Institute of Euthenics. Euthenics, the name of a Vassar department, meant right living and was a positive form of eugenics. On June 2, he mentioned that he was officer of the day at a base hospital.</p>

                  <p>The "Which Club" or the "Whichers" were friends from Wellesley College who sent out a round robin set of letters. When the robin returned to a member, she substituted a new letter, and sent the set on to the next person. Thus Marjorie Morse's letters were returned to her. Her letters discuss her nursing school education, her relationship with Allan Crunden, and the work and relationships of her friends. Among the friends mentioned are Peg Burchard, Mary Lou Henry, Grace (Gigi) Hoyer, "Psyche," and Sylvia ("Silly").</p>

                     <p>Su-Yuin Wang was a Chinese student studying in the Kyoto Girl's College in Japan who sent a letter and a greeting card to Yale, seeking a penpal to write to her. The folder also contains a letter to Marjorie Morse from Yale President, James A. Angell, sending the letter and the card; and a note to Miss Effie Taylor, Dean of the Yale School of Nursing, saying that Marjorie Morse left the correspondence for her to see. Su-Yuin Wang replies that her brother, Ying-Hua Wang, at Kalee University, will be coming to the United States and she hopes Marjorie will meet him. She encloses his photograph.
