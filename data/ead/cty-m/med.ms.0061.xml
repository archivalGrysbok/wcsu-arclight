         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>There are over 3,500 items in the collection, covering mainly the period from approximately 1870, when photographic images became widely available, through the 1970s, when the disability rights movement became an important force for social change. The items have been arranged by Dr. Bogdan in 14 large three-ring binders organized by topics. Their format varies but the great majority of the materials are postcards, and most of those are "real photo postcards."  Real photo postcards, as opposed to commercial photo postcards, were taken by individuals and developed on postcard stock rather than on photo paper. These postcards show people with a range of disabilities participating in regular life, pictures that might be found in family albums. The people are photographed as family members, friends and loved ones, not as clinical types. Other photo formats include cartes de visite, cabinet cards, as well as larger photographs, and snapshots. These are complemented by pamphlets and other printed materials. There are over one hundred pieces related to begging, primarily ephemera used by people with disabilities to solicit money. In addition, there are hundreds of items associated with organizations, both charities assisting people with disabilities, and other institutions where people with disabilities were confined. Most of the materials are from the United States, but some are from other countries.</p>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Robert Bogdan is Professor Emeritus of Social Science and Education at Syracuse University. He compiled an archive guided by the ideas of the field of Disability Studies, an approach that focuses on "disability" as a social, cultural, and political phenomenon. An early pioneer in that field, Bogdan has taught courses related to it since 1971. He started collecting disability ephemera in the early 1980s in order to advance his research and writing. As Bogdan began collecting he realized that although there were archives and collections related to specific aspects of disability and particular disability-related organizations, none took a broad Disability Studies approach.</p>
