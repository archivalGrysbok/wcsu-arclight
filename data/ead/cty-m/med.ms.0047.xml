The collection consists of ten volumes, the first five of which are Roth's notes on medical school lectures and clinics from 1878-1880. The remaining five include four volumes documenting his clinical practice in New Haven, 1891-1893, and one volume with a few entries on practice in Massachusetts in late 1893.</abstract>

         <p>Edward Roth graduated from Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City in 1880. The curriculum at the time was two years in length.  Shortly after graduation, about 1880-1882, he served as assistant to Dr. William D. Stewart at the Marine Hospital Service station in Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts. In 1883, he was practicing in San Francisco, where he married Eliza L. Beetle.  From 1891 to1893, he was practicing in New Haven, and then went back to Massachusetts. He eventually returned to Martha's Vineyard where he practiced in Vineyard Haven for the remainder of his career.  He died in Miami in 1919 on an annual visit to Florida with his wife.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection includes five notebooks of lecture and clinical notes from Bellevue Hospital Medical School, 1878-1880, covering anatomy, physiology, materia medica, obstetrics, diagnostics and therapeutics, diseases of women and children, nervous diseases, diseases of the genito-urinary system, and surgery.  His clinical education notebook recorded the clinics he attended and the cases he observed at Bellevue Hospital and at Charity Hospital, Blackwell's Island.  Four medical casebooks document his medical practice in New Haven from October 1891 to June 1893. They list over 1300 patient visits in the New Haven area, providing names, locations, and ailments.  Indexes to each volume note the numbers of visits to each patient and fees charged.  Although listed by the American Medical Association as an allopath, he may have been practicing an irregular form of medicine, as the ailments were general, his visits to patients were on a regular basis, and he recorded how many patients "renewed."  A fifth case book contains a few pages of notes on patient visits made in Massachusetts in October, 1893.</p>

                  <p>Roth wrote on the title page of this volume: "Dr. Roths Case Book "Y" New Haven Conn Oct 19th. 1891."  There are two patient entries per page. The arrangement is chronological.  Patients are listed with their address in New Haven or the name of a surrounding town or neighborhood (for example, West Haven, Waterbury, Stony Creek [Branford]).  The patient's condition is described in broad terms such as headache, buzzing in ears, pain in chest, cough, discharge from nose, rheumatism, arthritis, thick phlegm, etc.  If the entries contain treatments, they are in a shorthand.  There is an index of patient names in the back, and notes about the number of "renewals."  Another index lists money owed, but again there are abbreviations.</p>
