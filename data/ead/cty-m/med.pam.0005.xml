         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>Series 1 consists of sheet music in English in alphabetical order by title. Most items were published in London or in various cities in the United States, especially New York.  The songs include alma maters and other music for the medical professions, humorous songs about incompetent healers and hawkers of remedies, many sentimental songs about Red Cross nurses treating wounded soldiers in World War I, songs for children to sing, songs about particular maladies (rheumatism) or remedies (cod liver oil), and popular songs that refer to physicians, chiropractors, dentists, nurses, and drug stores. Many songs from the 19th and early twentieth century were featured in music  halls or as part of musicals. Portraits of performers are often featured on the cover of the sheet music. Some songs are radio theme songs. For the more recent period, there are recorded songs like Eric Clapton singing "Cocaine" or Loretta Lynn singing "The Pill," as well as theme songs from early TV shows on doctors and hospitals.</p>
         <p>Series 2 consists of sheet music in French, arranged by size and then alphabetically.  Most items were published in Paris, and most are from the 19th century or early 20th century. The lithographic cover illustrations are often by well-known printmakers. Many of the songs are part of comic scenes that contain both music and spoken words.  Others are comic monologues.</p>
         <p>Series 3 consists of a few songs in German and Dutch and several tangos from Buenos Aires, Argentina, notable for their colored cover illustrations of medical scenes and the dedication of the music to physicians.</p>
         <p>In all these series, a number  of items are incomplete and represented by an illustrated cover only, or a cover and a single page of music on the reverse.</p>
         <p>Series 4 includes sheet music that advertises a product--usually a patent medicine--or a practitioner.  Sometimes the songs or musical pieces are popular and unrelated to medicine, while other times, the words of the song directly praise the product.</p>
         <p>Series 5 is a very large collection of sheet music published by Emerson Drug Company, Baltimore, to advertise Bromo Seltzer. These date from about 1890 to 1910.  The songs themselves are popular and sentimental.</p>
         <p>Series 6, "Miscellaneous," includes sheet music advertising St. Jacob's Oil and Beecham's Pills; song books of several musicals on doctors; books of songs published by medical schools; and songs and songbooks by publishers who took patent medicine advertisements to lower the cost of selling the music.</p>

               <p>Many of the French songs are comic pieces performed at theaters in Paris including the Eldorado, the Alcazar, the Amabassadeurs, and La Scala.  Many items contain both spoken words and music.  Some are monologues, either with music for the entry and exit of the performer, or no music at all.  A number of the songs feature the clyster, a huge enema syringe, or its updated version the "Clyso" pump.</p>

               <head>Scope and Contents</head>
               <p>The Emerson Drug Company, Baltimore, Maryland, first produced Bromo-Seltzer in 1888.  It was marketed as a remedy for headache and neuralgia, and also for  insomnia, nervousness, hangover or depression following alcoholic excess, nervous dyspepsia, and stomach disorders.  Early advertisements noted that it contained no cocaine and no morphine.</p>
               <p>From the 1890s to the 1910s, the company produced collections of popular sheet music with piano and organ accompaniment.  Many of the songs were sentimental or patriotic. The front and back covers of the music contained advertisements for Bromo-Seltzer. The music was distributed for free by druggists all over the United States, many of whose names are stamped on the cover page of the music, or the pieces could be obtained from the Music Department of the Emerson Drug Company by enclosing a stamp and a Bromo-Seltzer wrapper.</p>
               <p>Most items do not have copyright dates. The most recent copyright date is 1900.  A number of pieces are by Philadelphia composer George M. Vickers or copyrighted by Vickers.</p>
               <p>There are several series:</p>
               <p>(1) Individual titles, not part of a collection. For one of these, "Murphy's Head," the words of the song directly advertised Bromo-Seltzer as a remedy for hangovers. These appear to date from 1890 to 1892.</p>
               <p>(2) Emerson Drug Co., <emph render="italic">The Bromo-Seltzer Collection of 54 Popular Songs, Complete and Unabridged. Full music Size with Piano and Organ Accompaniment</emph>.  The cover image is of a woman playing a Chickering piano. This edition predates the next and the song sheets date from 1890-1892.</p>
               <p>(3) Emerson Drug Co., <emph render="italic">The Bromo-Seltzer Collection of 74 Popular Songs, Complete and Unabridged, Full Music Size with Piano and Organ Accompaniment</emph>. Some songs include testimonials from 1892 and others have testimonials from 1895.  A few have "New Selections, Added January 1st 1898. A very few mention the forthcoming Columbian Exposition of 1893.  The date range is therefore ca. 1892-1898. The cover image is of a woman playing a Stieff Piano.</p>
               <p>(4) Emerson Drug Co., <emph render="italic">The Bromo-Seltzer Collection of 83 Popular Songs, Complete &amp; Unabridged with Piano &amp; Organ Accompaniment</emph>.  Version 1, with red and blue print, lists "New Selections Added, January 1st, 1899."  These songs may have a page of testimonials dated 1895.  The second version, black and white, which should be slightly later, lists the same songs as "New Selections Added."  The date is ca. 1899.</p>
               <p>(5) Emerson Drug. Co., <emph render="italic">Bromo-Seltzer Edition of 171 Popular Selections, Complete and Unabridged with Piano &amp; Organ Accompaniment.</emph> There are two versions. Version 1 shows a woman blowing a horn with her arm around a giant Bromo-Seltzer bottle. Version 2 has a decorative design that incorporates musical instruments and sheet music. These editions of 171 selections are more recent than the previous 83 popular songs and from the images are likely to date between 1900 and 1910.</p>
               <p>(6)  Emerson Drug Co., <emph render="italic">The Bromo-Seltzer New Edition: 52 Popular Selections, Complete &amp; Unabridged with Piano &amp; Organ Accompaniment.</emph>This edition presumes that there is a complete list of 171 selections. It is also likely to date from 1900 to 1910.</p>
               <p>(7) "Edition De Luxe." These have cover pages in color and were copyrighted by Will Wood. The De Luxe Music Co., New York, was the sole selling agent.  None are dated.  This sheet music no longer advertised Bromo-Seltzer on the front cover nor had the names of pharmacies printed on them. They were distributed "Compliments of Emerson Drug. Co."  Advertisements appear on the bottom of pages of music and on the back cover. They date from ca. 1910.  De Luxe Music Co. probably made similar arrangements to print music with advertisements for other companies.</p>

                  <p>St. Jacobs Oil was manufactured as far back as 1870 by the Charles A. Vogeler Company, Baltimore, Maryland, as a remedy for pain. The company published the "St Jacobs Oil Series of Music" similar to the Bromo-Seltzer sheet music. There is considerable overlap among titles.  The sheet music also contains advertisements for Diamond Vera-Cura, a remedy for dyspepsia.   As in the case of Bromo-Seltzer the music could be obtained in drug stores or by writing to the company, and enclosing a stamp and a product wrapper. The most recent pieces of sheet music (ca. 1905) were published by St. Jacobs Oil, Ltd, Baltimore.</p>
