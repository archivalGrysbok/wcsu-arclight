Liebow, professor of pathology at Yale School of Medicine, was a member of the Joint Commission for the Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan organized by Col. Ashley W. Oughterson, on leave from Yale. Liebow spent four months in Hiroshima beginning in October 1945 and kept a diary. The collection contains photographs and documents from an exhibit on the Joint Commission and the medical effects of the bomb in Hiroshima that was prepared for the Medical Library in 1965 and then loaned for display in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1966.</abstract>

         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>A native of Austria, Averill Liebow came to the United States as a young boy. He graduated magnum cum laude from City College of New York, and received his medical degree from Yale University in 1935. Appointed an assistant in pathology at Yale in 1935, he rose through the ranks to full professor in 1951. In 1968 he accepted the chairmanship of the department of pathology at the University of California, San Diego, which he held until his retirement in 1975. While on active duty during World War II, Liebow served as a pathologist with the 39th General Hospital, the Yale Unit in the South Pacific. During this time, he compiled elegant studies of cutaneous diphtheria that made specific treatment possible for a form of "jungle rot," which was a major problem in the South Pacific theater of the war. Immediately after the war, Liebow was recruited as a member of the Joint Commission for the Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bomb in Japan organized by Col. Ashley W. Oughterson, on leave from Yale, and Prof. Masao Tsuzuki of Japan. Liebow and the members of the Commission reached Hiroshima on October 12. During the four months Liebow remained in Hiroshima, he wrote an extensive diary in shorthand of his observations.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection relates to the pathological studies in Hiroshima after the bombing conducted by Liebow and his colleague on the Joint Commission for the Investigation of the Effects of the Atomic Bomb. The main portion consists of the materials from a 1965 exhibit at Yale University which was then sent for exhibit in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan in 1966.. It included portions of Liebow's original shorthand diary, correspondence, and reproductions of original photographs, charts and graphs. These document the damage to buildings, casualties, the flash burns and other injuries suffered by individuals, a case report, and other work of the Joint Committee. Much, but not all, of this material was published in "Encounter with Disaster: A Medical Diary of Hiroshima 1945," <emph render="italic">Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine</emph>, 38(2) (October 1965). The exhibit materials have been numbered by Madeline Stanton in Roman numerals by "case" and then with Arabic numerals (I.1, I.2, etc.). The collection also contains other items by Liebow among them, shorthand notes, typescripts, and another case report. Finally, the collection includes various typescripts and reprints related to the medical studies.</p>
