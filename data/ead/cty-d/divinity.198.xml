         <p>Morgan Phelps Noyes was born in Warren, Pennsylvania on March 29, 1891. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1910, from Yale University in 1914, from Union Theological Seminary in 1920, and received an M.A. from Columbia University in 1922. Noyes married Marjorie Clarke in 1926 and they had two children. He received an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 1938. He was a member of the Corporation of Yale University from 1945 to 1959. Rev. Noyes was a direct descendant of James Noyes (1640-1719), Senior Fellow of Yale University's original Board of Trustees.</p>
         <p>Rev. Noyes was ordained in 1917 prior to his service with the YMCA in Russia. He served as Assistant Minister at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City from 1919 to 1920. He then served the Presbyterian Church of Dobbs Ferry, NY from 1920 to 1925, First Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, NY from 1925 to 1932 and Central Presbyterian Church in Montclair, NJ from 1932 to 1957. Following his retirement he served in various interim pastorates in New Jersey and Connecticut. He was a member of the faculty at The Masters School, Dobbs Ferry from 1921 to 1925 and was Associate Professor Practical Theology at Union Theological Seminary from 1945 to 1951.</p>
         <p>Noyes died on June 20, 1972. For additional biographical information, see Series III, Biographical Documentation.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The sermons, writings, and biographical documentation in this collection provide insight into the life and work of prominent minister and civic leader Morgan Phelps Noyes. As noted in the memorial tribute of Yale Chaplain Sidney Lovett, Noyes was a "scholar and teacher, churchman and community leader, author and preacher."</p>
         <p>Series I, Sermons, contains typescript and printed sermons from the years 1929 to 1971. The chronologically arranged sermons are followed by undated sermons arranged by title and scriptural text.</p>
         <p>Series II, Writings and Notes, provides a flavor of the writings Noyes published in magazines and newspapers, as well as his booklength works and prayers. Notes from his days as a Yale student and as a minister are also available.</p>
         <p>Series III, Biographical Documentation, includes documents, clippings, certificates, and tributes to Noyes' work for the church and community.  Of particular interest are a set of 44 colored glass lantern slides that document the period when Noyes was serving with the YMCA in Russia, working with the Russian and Czechoslovakian armies during World War I. The slides show everyday life, street scenes, and military personnel in Russia during this era.</p>
