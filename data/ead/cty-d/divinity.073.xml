         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Pope's 1938 introductory course in Social Ethics was described as follows in the Bulletin of Yale University Divinity School: "... an examination, in the light of sociological facts, of contemporary problems of industry, race, property distribution, the family, etc., and a consideration of the social and ethical implications of various forms of economic and political organization. Secular proposals for social reconstruction [are] investigated, and particular attention devoted to the relevance of the Christian ethic to the social order."</p>
         <p>In this course, and in others such as "Contemporary Social Systems", "The Church and Social Classes", "The Church and Labor", and "Christianity and Communism", Pope and his students addressed social issues from both descriptive and analytic perspectives, engaging topical areas both as discrete societal issues and events, and as wide-ranging phenomena impacting the character of American society. Pope systematically collected primary source materials from hundreds of different organizations and on many different topics to support his teaching - materials as wide ranging as daily newspapers from World War II relocation camps for Japanese-Americans, virulent antisemitic propaganda, a comic book depicting America's possible fate under Communism, and literature for and against the National Health Insurance program proposed by President Truman in 1948.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The Social Ethics Pamphlet Collection is divided into three series:</p>    
         <list>
            <item>I. Corporate Bodies</item>
            <item>II. Topical Files</item>
            <item>III. Student Papers</item>
         </list>
         <p>The subject areas most extensively documented by the Collection are as follows:</p>    
         <list>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">Race relations:</emph> The majority of the material related to race relations deals with the relationship between African Americans and white Americans, but there are also significant holdings that address antisemitic, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant sentiments in American society.</item>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">Communism and subversive activity:</emph> A notable group of materials pertains to the use of the Communist threat as a tool by political and industrial interests to discredit the labor and civil rights movements. The potency of the Communist threat in the public mind is well documented.</item>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">Labor and industrial relations:</emph> Significant materials document the growing labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s as well as the political response of industry; the propaganda war between labor and industry is well documented. The collection reveals Pope's particular interest in labor relations in terms of issues of economic justice and enfranchisement.</item>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">Ecumenical and individual church organizations:</emph> Materials representative of numerous Protestant denominations and Catholic Church agencies provide a profile of movement toward church cooperation during this era, and the engagement of the Christian community with social issues. The most extensive holdings are from the Congregational Christian Churches and the United Church of Christ. Beyond printed material related to social issues, there is also significant documentation of the ecclesiastical battle surrounding the merger of the Congregational Christian Churches and Evangelical and Reformed Church, forming the United Church of Christ.</item>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">Judaism, Israel-Arab conflicts, Jews in America:</emph> There are four areas of emphasis within this subject category: 1) the relations between the Jewish and Christian communities in America, 2) the American Jewish labor movement, 3) Jewish life in America (particularly the activities of Hillel and B'nai Brith), and 4) the Zionist movement and the inception of the state of Israel. Some documentation relating to the Holocaust is available amidst materials relating to European war refugees and international relief.</item>
            <item>
               <emph render="bold">World War, 1939-1945:</emph> The focus of these materials is not the military aspects of the conflict, but rather the societal and human costs of the war. Efforts to assist refugees and provide economic relief to war areas are documented. Peace movements in the U.S., primarily before 1942, are also documented.</item>
         </list>
         <p>In addition to these broad subject areas, there is also significant documentation related to specific societal phenomena such as agriculture and rural life, alcoholism, birth control, cooperative societies, mental health and medical care;</p>
         <p>Series I, Corporate Bodies, includes material from more than one thousand different organizations representing all points on the political and religious spectra. A sample entry, below, indicates the categories utilized to describe material contained in this series:</p>

         <p>There is extensive documentation in this series of the "us" versus "them" mentality in American society during this era, in all its various manifestations. Material in this series can be linked with related materials in Series I through subject heading searches.</p>
         <p>Series III, Student Papers, contains 143 typescript term papers prepared by Yale Divinity School students. Prof. Pope encouraged his students to collect primary documents and conduct survey and interviews in connection with their research for these papers. This collected data is of objective value, even beyond the students' interpretation of it, and in many cases samples of primary source material are included with the paper.</p>
