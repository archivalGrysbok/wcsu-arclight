         <abstract id="aspace_b601d595223c508510ba156697ac0ea0">The papers detail Wright's personal life and professional work. They are particularly useful for their documentation of his involvement in religious activity at Yale from 1894-1923 and in YMCA work during the first World War. Henry Burt Wright was born in New Haven, Connecticut on January 29, 1877. He received the B.A. (1898) and Ph.D. (1903) degrees from Yale University. He was a professor at Yale from 1903-1923. He was active in Christian work among university students and in the work of the YMCA during World War I. He died in Oakham, Massachusetts on December 27, 1923.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These papers provide a thorough picture of Wright's life and work and are particularly useful for their documentation of his involvement in religious activity-at Yale from 1894 to 1923 and in Y.M.C.A. work during the first World War.</p>
         <p>Series I, Correspondence, dates from 1901 to 1925 and is divided into Family Correspondence and General Correspondence. Letters from his wife, sister and parents during times of separation give insight into the rich family life which was so important to Wright. Letters in the General Correspondence section reveal the various facets of Wright's career--his interests in Ancient History, Yale history, religious activity at Yale, Y.M.C.A. work, mission work and the community affairs and baseball team of Oakham, Mass. Wright was a disciplined man who took a personal interest in the lives of many people. His character is reflected in the substance and detail of his correspondence. Notable correspondents include John R. Mott, Robert P. Wilder, David R. Porter, Kenneth S. Latourette, Anson Phelps Stokes, E. Hershey Sneath, Charles R. Brown, George Sherwood Eddy and Robert E. Speer.</p>
         <p>Series II consists of a topically arranged file which documents Wright's involvements and interests. Included in the file are class notes taken by Wright, notes for lectures, talks and sermons, drafts of unpublished writings, schedules, printed material and student papers. The topics range from "Studies in the Life of Christ" to "Fraternities and Secret Societies" to "Yale: School of Religion, Publicity Committee" to "Y.M.C.A.: Commission on Advance Program Among Students". This file provides valuable insight into the issues and concerns of religious work among college students during the first quarter of the 20th century. It is particularly useful in documenting the course of Christian activity at Yale and the development of the Yale School of Religion. Another large group of material documents the role played by the Y.M.C.A. during World War I.</p>
         <p>Series III, Published Writings, consists of one box of material arranged alphabetically by title. The writings date from 1909 to 1921 and reflect Wright's interests in student religious work, Y.M.C.A. war work and Ancient History.</p>
         <p>Series IV, Personal Items and Memorabilia is divided into five sections:</p>
