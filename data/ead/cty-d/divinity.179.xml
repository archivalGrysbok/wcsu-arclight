         <abstract id="aspace_18d25f71b1ccd6327e1c1e0dba11b55b">This collection documents the work of Alva I. Cox, Jr., an independent film maker whose work chronicled the civil rights movement, human rights struggles, and ecumenical Christianity both nationally and globally. The films, slides, pictures, audio cassettes, and paperwork of the Cox collection have been organized by topic. Of particular note are the materials related to Cox's film "Kent State: May 1970." The film, cuts, paperwork, and other materials regarding Kent State complement the notebooks of Peter Davies with whom Cox worked in the making of his Kent State film. The Davies notebooks are held in the Yale University Library Manuscripts and Archives Kent State Collection. Al Cox served for sixteen years as a staff member of the National Council of Churches in training and communications. After leaving the Council in 1967 to engage in freelance film work, he wrote more than thirty-five television scripts for the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). He also served as a communication consultant to various community organizations, labor unions, minority business enterprises, and church groups. Cox received an STM degree from Yale Divinity School in Contemporary Theology.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The following excerpts from the National of Council of Churches obituary notice for Cox give a glimpse of his prominent role as a film maker:</p>
         <p>...Colleagues spoke of Cox's important "behind the scenes" roles of building connections among major media, churches and justice movements and of telling the story of those movements....As Protestant consultant to CBS-TV's Sunday morning "Look Up and Live" series from 1967-76, Cox "was the best bridge for CBS to the civil rights movement, and he was the one who established our credibility with civil rights leaders," said Pamela Ilott, former CBS-TV vice president for cultural and religious broadcasting, now retired. "I don't think people know the debt they owe to Al Cox for being such a vital link between religious faith, social consciousness, and the creation of public awareness about the truth of racism. Andrew Young, in his memoirs, cited Al Cox of CBS as the key to creating a relationship with the network."... Ilott continued, "Al was ahead of so much of the then current church thinking of the 50's and 60's. He was willing to try out new ideas and to take risks. He was a real ally for me. Those many decades ago, I think he represented the very best of the younger church movement of the churches in civil rights and reconciliation. And his later work simply confirmed that. This shouldn't be forgotten.... Contacted with word of Cox's death, Ambassador Young whose long association with Cox included service together with Cox on the staff of the National Council of Churches in the 1950s said of him, "Countless Americans unknowingly have viewed the civil rights movement through the eyes of Al Cox. Al early identified the Gospel's demands within the Movement, stayed with it when the going got rough and subsequently interpreted its meaning to two more generations."</p>
         <p>Series I of the Alva I. Cox Papers is a "catch-all" category of church related media.

                     <p>This program is about an evangelical academy set up in Germany after World War II to address some of the changes in the church from the pre-war rural communities in which pastors knew all their parishoners, to post-war, industrial communities where urbanization and mobility have made people strangers. At this evangelical academy, business leaders come to discuss issues such as involvement of faith in work, diversity of faith in the workplace, and issues of mobility and urbanization. Students also come there to discuss starting out their new lives as adults, such as issues concerning marriage and finding a home. The evangelical academy also provides a format of informal discussion where employees can discuss and debate as equals with their employers.</p>

                     <p>This program focuses on Christ Church, a Presbyterian church in Burlington, Vermont. This community discusses such issues as whether or not the material needs of the church are distracting from the true purpose of the church, how are people to be members of the body of Christ and what are their responsibilities as members, what is the mission of the church and how is it enacted, and how can the church be made relevant to the needs of the community.</p>

                     <p>This film starts out by showing the poverty for African-Americans in Mississippi. Racism is a major barrier to changing this condition. However, local African-American churches invite the NCC to come in and help implement changes, such as providing transportation for African-Americans to register to vote.</p>

                     <p>This film focuses on the work of the NCC and WCC to unify and help with reconciliation. An example of efforts at reconciliation are in the "Pilgrimage for Peace," where Christian leaders from the U.S. travel to the Middle East on a mission of peace to try and end the Gulf War. Then the film shifts focus to unity within the church when Rev. Billy Graham speaks with the NCC. This focus on unity and reconciliation continues when the WCC visits the Aborigines of Australia. Finally, the film relates issues of feminism and feminist theology to unity and reconciliation, concluding with the installation of Rev. Joan Campbell as General Secretary of the NCC.</p>

                  <p>This program is about the burning of the New Hope Baptist Church in the mid-1990's. The official explanation of the cause of the fire is that it was an accident due to a faulty electrical box, but members of the congregation believe it was caused by people who had problems with the social activeness of this church, such as having reached an understanding with the Jewish community. However, members of the community help to rebuild this church.</p>

                     <p>This film is a 50 minute three-part film drama about a 13 year-old girl troubled by family problems and difficulties in school, who feels driven to run away from home and gradually falls into deeper trouble with the law. It is the story, too, of missed opportunities on the part of the school, the juvenile justice system and the community-at-large which because of a lack of viable alternatives and sensitive response, fail to meet the needs of Jane and her family.</p>

                     <p>A narrator reads Buddhist teachings (in English) while a Buddhist monk is shown enacting these teachings within the community. A little boy accompanies the monk, and he then becomes the lead in a play telling about the story of the prince who became the Buddha. Every boy in Burma becomes the young prince once in his life. He must wear the robes of a Buddhist monk for at least the following week; but sometimes he chooses to wear it longer, whether it be for a month, a year, or perhaps for the rest of his life.</p>

                  <p>This film recreates the events at Kent State University leading up to the shootings in which members of the Ohio National Guard killed 4 students and injured 9 others. E.G. Marshall narrates a detailed chronology of the actions triggered by President Nixon's announcement of the invasion of Cambodia. The live action takes place in actual campus locations, but the film cuts to still photos taken by the many photographers to document each assertion. These photos help reconstruct the events accurately and to assess the various, contradictory interpretations of what happened that day.</p>
