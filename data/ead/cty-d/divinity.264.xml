         <abstract id="aspace_2510e46e3aac414a994311388436f701">These records document the activities of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment (NRPE), an alliance composed of four likeminded independent member organizations, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the National Council of Churches of Christ (NCCC), the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL), and the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN). The NRPE formally began its activities in October of 1993. Since then, the NRPE and its member organizations have been striving for a better environment by raising money for environmental projects and initiatives, initiating programs to address critical environmental concerns, and by generating hundreds of press stories that have documented the contributions of the faith community. The NRPE has also initiated or sponsored key events designed to help its member organizations make the case that the environment is essentially a moral concern.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection documents the foundation of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment (NRPE) and its subsequent activities, including the activities undertaken by the NRPE's four independent member organizations, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the National Council of Churches of Christ (NCCC), the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL), and the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN). The materials in this collection are evidence of the concerns that these religious groups and other affiliated religious groups have for the environment. The mission statement of the NRPE is as follows: "Guided by biblical teaching, the Partnership seeks to encourage people of faith to weave values and programs of care for God's creation throughout the entire fabric of religious life: 1) Liturgy, worship and prayer; 2) Theological study, the education of future clergy, and of the young; 3) The stewardship of our homes, lands and resources; 4) Protecting the lives of our communities and health of our children; 5) Our social ministry to the poor and vulnerable who have first and preferential claim on our conscience; 6) Bringing the perspectives of moral values and social justice before public policymakers."</p>
         <p>Series I, National Religious Partnership for the Environment, contains organization and policy records, campaigns and events, and publicity and outreach. The NRPE organization and policy records include reports and proposals documenting the history and administrative actions of the NRPE. Records of notable campaigns and events launched by the NRPE such as the Campaign for Sustainability and Justice, the Children's Environmental Health Campaign, Partnership Move Forward, Mission to Washington, and the Interfaith Climate and Energy Campaign are included.</p>
         <p>Series II, Partner Organizations, contains documents from each of the four partner organizations, the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL), the Evangelical Environmental Network (EEN), THE National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. (NCCC), and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Notable campaigns are covered including the EEN's "What Would Jesus Drive" initiative, the Black Curch Economic and Environmental Justice movement, and the Children's Environmental Health project as it relates to the USCC.</p>
         <p>Series III, Resource Materials, contains materials on a host of related organizations as well as related individuals, news clippings, and scholarship. One of the most documented related organizations is the Union for Concerned Scientists. The related materials include information on a 2008 NRPE conference hosted by the Yale Divinity School as well as the NRPE's relationship with the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Science. A large portion of the news clippings represent press coverage of the "What Would Jesus Drive?" campaign.</p>
         <p>Series IV, Audio-Visual Material, includes documentation in several formats produced by the NRPE and related organizations.</p>
         <p>Portions of this collection have been digitized. For more information regarding access to the digital files, please contact the Special Collections Librarian at divinity.library@yale.edu.</p>
