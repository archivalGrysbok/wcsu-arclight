         <abstract id="aspace_62d0878deb4e35cf69e2da13ea945d14">The China Records Project Miscellaneous Personal Papers Collection is an open collection. It currently contains material from more than 325 individuals, primarily Protestant missionaries to China. The time period covered is approximately from 1834 to 1998. The China Records Project was initiated by the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A in 1968. The aim of the project was to insure the preservation of the personal records of former missionaries to China and to provide a central repository where these papers would be available to historians. The Yale Divinity School Library was chosen as this central repository in 1969 and has continued to solicit and accept China-related papers since that time.</abstract>

         <p>The China Records Project was initiated by the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A in 1968. The aim of the project was to insure the preservation of the personal records of former missionaries to China and to provide a central repository where these papers would be available to historians. The Yale Divinity School Library was chosen as this central repository in 1969 and has continued to solicit and accept China-related papers since that time.</p>
         <p>The first Protestant missionary to China was Robert Morrison, who arrived in 1807. Elijah Coleman Bridgman was the first American missionary to China, sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in 1829. Protestant missionaries were active in China until ca. 1950 when they were forced to leave by the new Communist government.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection consists of more than 380 boxes, with no individual accounting for more than three linear feet. Some collections that were formerly part of this record group have now been given separate record group numbers.</p>
         <p>The papers in the first series of this collection are arranged alphabetically by name. When the information was available, each missionary's sending agency, geographical location in China and period of service have been noted. A key to abbreviations used to represent the mission sending agencies is given below. The designation "L" in the indications of period of service means that these are approximate dates derived from listings in available copies of the Directory of Protestant Missions in China (1902, 1904-05, 1908-11, 1916, 1921, 1923-24, 1926-30, 1932-36, 1940, 1950). An asterisk following the name of an individual means that at least a portion of the papers of that individual are available on microfilm (and therefore accessible via Interlibrary Loan)and through the Adam Matthew "China Through Western Eyes" database:  http://www.researchsource.amdigital.co.uk/ASChina.</p>
         <p>Some photographs in the collection have been digitized and are available through the Internet Mission Photography Archive (IMPA) - http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/arc/digarchives/mission/. If availability in IMPA is indicated, search the IMPA database using the name of the individual, e.g., search for "Edward Abbott Papers."</p>
         <p>The records in this collection include biographical information, correspondence, diaries and journals, writings, printed material, tape recordings, artifacts, photographs and maps. The medical, educational and evangelical work of both men and women missionaries in China is reflected in the material. Social issues such as footbinding, opium reform, education of women, cruelty to animals and child labor are also touched upon. The material is particularly valuable for the descriptions of daily missionary life and work which it provides. Missionary opinion about major social and political issues is less prevalent in the material, although personal accounts of some political events (such as the Boxer Rebellion and the internment of missionaries by the Japanese) are given.</p>
         <p>The Oral History Transcripts of Series II are from the China Missionaries Oral History Project conducted at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, CA in the early 1970s.</p>

                  <p>Biog. info: After marrying Mr. and Mrs. Burch began missionary work in China in 1906 in Wuhu. From 1906-1918, they worked under the Advent Christian Missions, and from 1918-1940 under the United Christian Mission Society. They experienced the Civil War of China (1911-1912), the Revolution (1926-1928) and the Japanese War (1936-1940). The Burches had four daughters, one of whom died tragically in her early twenties, after undergoing surgery. The Burches returned to the U.S., and Mr. Burch traveled for the UCMS. for two years. In 1942, he became an assistant professor at Texas Christian University, earning his M.A. from the university in 1947.</p>

                  <p>Biog info: Emma Jane Foster was an exchange student at Lingnan University in 1935-1936. She received her B.A. from Penn State in 1937, her Masters in Nursing from Yale School of Nursing in 1940, and worked for the Minneapolis Nursing Association. She served on the medical team of the Flying Tigers American Volunteer Group in China, where she met and married John "Pete" Petach, one of the airmen, in February 1942. Petach died in a bombing raid in July 1942 and Emma Jane returned to the U.S. where she gave birth to their child Joan Claire Petach in February 1943. She continued her nursing career and later married Fletcher Hanks in 1964.</p>

                  <p>Biog. info.: Juanita Byrd Huang was a Southern Baptist missionary who taught English at the University of Shanghai from 1929 until her marriage to a Chinese in 1946. The Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board disassociated itself from her at the time of her marriage. After a furlough in 1936 she returned to China and when the Japanese occupied Shanghai she was temporarily sent with other missionary women and children to the Philippines. Returning to Shanghai, she continued to teach in Shanghai, though part of the university had migrated to West China. Following a period in a Japanese internment camp at Chapei Centre, she was repatriated to the U.S. She returned to China in 1946 and married Claude Huang. They remained in China until 1957 when Claude was finally allowed to leave the country via Hong Kong.</p>

                     <unittitle>Papers consist of more than 85 photocopies of mimeographed circular letters. These substantive letters (some ten or more pages) date from 1947 until 1958 and provide valuable detailed information about the Church in China in the years leading up to and following the Communist takeover. Lee had extensive correspondence with Chinese and Western individuals in China while he was working in Hong Kong and received numerous Christian periodicals from China, from which he quotes in his circular letters. He provides specific information des- cribing the work of missionaries who remained in China following the Communist takeover and regarding the status of schools and hospitals in the interior. He provides information about Church activities and conferences in China such as the Enlarged Council of the Lutheran Church in China meeting in January, 1951 and the Peking Christian Conference of April, 1951 where the Accusation Movement was inaugurated. These letters are written from a clearly anti-Communist stance. They provide extensive information regarding the development of the Three Self Movement in China.</unittitle>

                  <p>Biog. info: Dr. Edith Millican (1914-1985) was born in China of missionary parents. In 1943, she was asked by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions to work in China, since a doctor was badly needed at the mission hospital in Hengyang, Hunan. Dr. Millican served in China until 1948.</p>

                  <p>Biog. info: Lyman Burt Peet (1809-) graduated from Middlebury College in 1834, and entered Andover Seminary. There he discovered a call to missionary work and in 1839 married Rebecca Sherrill; later that same year, the couple sailed for Bangkok, Siam, where they worked for six years among the Chinese people there. After that, the Peets were sent to start the mission in Foochow, China, where they began work in 1847. A year after his wife's death in 1856, Lyman Peet returned to the U.S. and married his second wife, Hannah Plimpton.</p>

                  <p>Biog. info: Clara Sargent went to China in 1919 as the first female doctor to serve in the field of public health. She worked with the National Council on Health Education and served on the faculty of the Women's College of Physical Education in Shanghai, which later became a department of Ginling College in Nanking. She promoted public health campaigns in China and helped in writing health textbooks for Chinese government schools. In 1921, she married the Rev. Dr. George Shepherd, and served as a physician and public health director under the ABCFM in Shaowu and Foochow in Fukien. She and Rev. Shepherd were evacuated from China shortly before Pearl Harbor.</p>

                  <p>Biog. info: RCUS, Peking (1924-1926), Yochow City, Hunan (1926-1927); John Calvin Stucki, medical missionary for the Reformed Church in the U.S. became superintendent of the Hoy Memorial Hospital at Yochow City, Hunan in April 1926 following a period of training in Peking. Yochow City was taken over by the Kuomintang in August, 1926. In November, the workers at the mission went on strike and students began making demands. In late 1926, educational work was discontinued at the mission and, in January of 1927, the nurses training school at Hoy was forced to close and women and children were evacuated. JCS was held captive by the Nationalists until February when he was permitted to join his wife and return to the U.S.</p>

They were married in 1914 and had seven children: Augustine, Annie, Maria, Joseph, Elizabeth, Sarah, and Beverley. A.W. Tucker's brother Ellis was a professor at St. John's University in Shanghai. His brother Henry St. George Tucker was a missionary in Japan and later Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America.</p>
