         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection provides extensive valuable documentation of the development of ecumenical Christianity in Asia from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s. The East Asia Christian Conference, formed in 1957 and renamed Christian Conference of Asia in 1973, grew out of earlier efforts of the International Missionary Council and World Council of Churches to support and encourage the development of Christian churches and Asian Christian leaders in Asia. 
From its foundation, the Christian Conference of Asia has focused on mission, leadership development, ecumenical relationships, and issues of social justice in Asia.</p>
         <p>The records are valuable for their documentation of the organizational development of ecumenical Christianity in Asia but also for the insight they provide on a wide variety of social issues in Asia such as development, health, refugees, disabilities, gender, globalization, labor, and other social justice issues. Because CCA networked with so many other religious organizations in Asia and throughout the world, this collection provides valuable insight on the worldwide ecumenical movement throughout the last half of the 20th century.</p>
         <p>A large and complex archive, the records in this collection migrated with the CCA throughout Asia as the organization had its headquarters in various countries. The offices and program desks of the CCA were somewhat decentralized and often kept parallel records so there is some overlap and duplication in the archival record. Some records had been compiled and described by the organization in previous years while other similar records were completely unorganized.  An effort has been made to rationalize the structure of the archives according to CCA's various leaders, program units, and functions, but it is recommended that the researcher use keyword searching of the finding aid to locate all materials related to any particular event,issue, or person.</p>
         <p>Note that many pamphlets and books published by the Christian Conference in Asia are in the Yale Divinity Library's cataloged collection rather than in this archival collection. A search for Christian Conference in Asia as "Publisher" in Orbis results in nearly 200 hits.</p>
         <p>For additional description of the history and program activities of the CCA, see <title>
               From Prapat to Colombo : history of the Christian Conference of Asia (1957-1995)
            </title> by Yap Kim Hao, and other works in the Library's cataloged collection. The website of the CCA also provides historical information about the organization and a valuable listing of its leaders and staff members over the years: http://cca.org.hk/home/cca-history/.</p>

               <p>This series contains files of the CCA General Secretaries and Associate General Secretaries of Finance and Program Coordination.  It is predominately composed of correspondence with member councils and churches as well as correspondence with partner and donor agencies.  It also contains conference papers, sermons, articles, speeches, and manuscripts from various secretaries and CCA Executive Committee meeting materials.   Meeting and conference records include invitations, participant correspondence, planning materials, press releases, programmes, and travel reports. This series also includes early EACC papers and D. T. Niles correspondence and papers. There is considerable overlap between these files and files found in other series. For additional D.T. Niles Papers, see the Divinity Library's record group no. 260.</p>

Country files contain correspondence collected material, country profiles.  This series also contains URM-funded project reports and funding proposals.  Conferences and consultation topics include  globalization, industry, labor, and social justice.  This sub-series contains conference papers, meeting minutes, participant invitations and correspondence, programs, as well as general planning materials.</p>
