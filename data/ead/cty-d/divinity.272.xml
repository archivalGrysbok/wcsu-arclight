         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>This collection documents Hageman's lifelong involvement in social justice and ecumenical work, including her participation in international ministry through Frontier Internship in Mission, her founding of the Committee of Returned Volunteers and the Cuba Resource Center during the Cold War, her extensive involvement with the World Student Christian Federation. Her work and personal life are closely intertwined with other ecumenical women of the era, including Margaret Flory, for whom she organized a number of events.
The collection provides valuable primary source documentation of the activities of the Committee of Returned Volunteers and other organizations during the late 1960s and early 1970s, including protests against the Vietnam war, U.S. engagement in Latin America, and other social justice issues.
A complementary collection of Alice L. Hageman papers is held by the Wisconsin Historical Society.</p>
