         <abstract id="aspace_565fcb0e6c6c3d1980679586e216ed28">Correspondence, writings, notes, course-related material, and collected material document the life and work of George Lindbeck, noted Yale theologian. The collection is a rich source of information about Lutheran-Roman Catholic dialogue and Vatican II. Lindbeck, the Pitkin Professor Emeritus of Historical Theology, served on the faculty of Yale Divinity School and the Yale University Religious Studies department after graduating from the Divinity School in 1946 and receiving his Ph.D. from Yale in 1955. He is the author of six books, including <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal Age
            </title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">
               Challenge and Response: A Protestant Perspective on the Vatican Council
            </title>. Lindbeck's many awards include several honorary degrees and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was a delegate to the second Vatican Council in Rome in the 1960s and has long been active in ecumenical dialogue, particularly between the Lutheran and Roman Catholic Churches. Lindbeck's "Report on Ecclesiastically Independent Theological Education" released by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1976 was also a notable contribution.</abstract>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>These papers document in a thorough way Lindbeck's work as a student, professor, and participant in ecumenical dialogue - his writings, lectures, courses taught at Yale, ecumenical activities, and work related to theological education. There is considerable overlap between the various series and sub-series described below.</p>
         <p>The Correspondence of Series I dates from 1937 to 1996 and is primarily related to Lindbeck's academic and ecumenical work, rather than personal in nature. The series is organized chronologically, with undated letters at the end. The first sub-series of Series II, Writings, contains writings from Lindbeck's student days. The second part of Series II contains articles and reviews arranged according to the various topics of interest to Lindbeck. Series III, Material related to <title type="simple" render="italic">
               The Nature of Doctrine
            </title>, contains response to the book by others, and Lindbeck's responses to the responses. Series IV, Notes, is grouped in broad topical categories. Series V, Course-Related Materials, documents Lindbeck's teaching activity at Yale. The material is organized by class number, with classes without a given number organized alphabetically. Series VI, Conferences/Lectures, contains drafts and finished products for Lindbeck's many speaking and conference engagements. The materials are arranged chronologically, with undated material arranged alphabetically by title. Series VII, Collected Materials: Theological Education, is organized into topics which are alphabetically ordered. Series VIII, Collected Materials: Ecumenism, is broken into subsections, including Lutheran, Roman Catholic, and Lutheran-Roman Catholic Dialogues. Within these subsections, materials are organized by topics which are alphabetically ordered. Series IX, Collected Materials: General, is organized by topics which are alphabetically ordered. Series X, Personal Items and Memorabilia, is organized by topics which are alphabetically ordered. An eleventh series, Addendum, was added in 2011 but with the receipt of additional documentation in 2014, the material from the Addendum series has now been integrated as subseries of the original series structure in order to provide better access.</p>
