         <p>George Albert Coe has been called one of the three foremost pioneers in the field of psychology of religion along with William James and Edwin D. Starbuck. Coe served for many years as chairman of the Committee on Militarism in Education and was Honorary President of the Religious Education Association. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, producing noteworthy articles through his eighth decade. In one of the many tributes which appeared after Coe's death, Stewart G. Cole wrote: "He enlisted his germinal mind and his social passion in rethinking religion in terms of the needs of man's experience, the growth of human personality and the social issues affecting the well-being of every individual." (Cole, Stewart G., "A Tribute", Religious Education, March-April, 1952, p. 88.)</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The first series, Correspondence is divided into three sections:</p>    
         <list>
            <item>a) General</item>
            <item>b) Letters of sympathy received at the time of the death of Mrs. Coe.</item>
            <item>c) Letters received at the time of Coe's retirement in 1927</item>
         </list>
         <p>The General section includes correspondence with Coe's professional colleagues and personal friends. Correspondence with friends sheds light on Coe's personality and character. Substantive letters to and from colleagues give insight into the development of Coe's thought throughout his long career, a development which led Coe to write at age eighty-two: "I have reexamined my own position with the result of becoming to a significant extent a dissenter from some of my own published writings." (Preface of Coe's book, What is Religion Doing to Our Consciences?) Notable correspondents include: William Clayton Bower, Emil Brunner, Adelaide Case, Harrision Elliott, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Hugh Hartshorne and A. J. W. Myers. Correspondence from the period before 1915 is included in the scrapbooks maintained by Coe to document the reception of his published works.</p>
         <p>The second series, Writings, dates from 1883 to 1951. The writings are primarily articles and essays in printed or reprint form with a few typescript drafts. Manuscripts of Coe's major works are not represented in this series.</p>    
         <list>
            <item>a) Reviews of Coe's books (1924-1943). Reviews of earlier publications are included in the four scrapbooks which follow Series IV.</item>
            <item>b) Reports and minutes of the Committee on Militarism in Education of which Coe was chairman for many years (1936-1940).</item>
            <item>c) Miscellaneous (1924-1947,n.d.): Includes material from the Military Intelligence Association, Inc., which disapproved of Coe's pacifist stance and of the activities of the Committee on Militarism in Education.</item>
         </list>
         <p>The fourth series, Personal Items and Memorabilia, includes three folders. The first contains biographical material regarding Coe, including bibliographies of his published works. The second folder contains photographs of Coe and ones taken by him. The third folder contains material regarding Coe's wife, Sadie Knowland Coe, including photographs, newspaper clippings regarding her death, and music composed by her.</p>
         <p>The four bound volumes date from 1900 to 1920. They contain reviews and correspondence regarding Coe's published works.</p>
