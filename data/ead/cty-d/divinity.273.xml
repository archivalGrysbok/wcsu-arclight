         <p>This collection provides extensive detailed documentation of the life and work of Theodora Culver Gleysteen and William H. Gleysteen, American Presbyterian missionaries based in Peking (now Beijing), North China from 1905 to 1943. The Gleysteens were engaged in educational work, primarily at Truth Hall, a high school for boys.</p>
         <p>The collection is notable for the regular and substantive documentation that it contains.  The collection centers around the family of Theodora Culver Gleysteen and includes papers related to her parents, Theodore Baker Culver and Annie Wallace Culver, thus providing a valuable longterm picture of the background and family interactions of a missionary wife, mother, and teacher during the first half of the twentieth century. Documentation of the Gleysteens' and Culvers' lives and work includes detailed, regular letters exchanged primarily with Theodora's parents, diaries, writings, memorabilia, and photographs.</p>
         <p>In addition to his education-related work for the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church (USA) William Gleysteen was president of the American Association in Peking, and served as a director of Yenching University, the Peking American School, and the College of Chinese Studies. For a period he was a member of the International Famine Relief Commission.</p>
         <p>Theodora Culver Gleysteen taught English at Truth Hall and engaged in relief work during the war in addition to being the mother of five children and three stepchildren. The Gleysteen children attended Peking American School.</p>
         <p>Theodora and William Gleysteen and their two youngest children were interned at the Weihsien internment camp for several months in 1943.</p>
         <p>A DVD containing digital scans of substantial portions of the documents and photographs in this collection is contained in Box 1 Folder 1.</p>
