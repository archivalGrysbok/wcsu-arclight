         <p>June Rosa Pitt Ross was born May 2, 1931 in Taree, NSW, Australia. She went to the University of Sydney to earn a BSc, PhD, and DSc. She did post-doctoral work under an AAUW (American Association of University Women) scholarship at Yale University (and Peabody Museum of Natural History). June taught biology at Western Washington University from 1967-2004. She was active in both the International Association of Bryozoologists and the Paleontological Society.</p>
         <p>Charles Alexander Ross was born 16 Apr 1933 in Champaign, IL. He completed a BA at the University of Colorado before coming to Yale University for his PhD. He worked for a few years at the Illinois State Geological Survey before joining the geology faculty at Western Washington University in 1964. His work focuses primarily on Pennsylvanian-Permian foraminifera and their use in biostratigraphy.</p>
