<head>Acquisition Information</head>
<p>This collection came to CHS from the estate of Evelyn D. Pollard. Her will specified that CHS was to get any papers and photographs related to her father's side of the family which includes Pollard, Dimock, Gardiner, Brigham, Richardson, Gurley, Main and other families of Coventry, CT and nearby towns, as well as pictures of the Brigham Tavern, Wright's Mill, Hale Homestead, scrapbooks of clippings, and genealogy. Papers and photographs related to her mother's Wilbur side of the family from Griswold, CT were to go to other distant family members. However the executors of the estate were unable to find the named family members and the Probate Court decided that CHS would get all of the family archive. CHS deaccessioned most of the Wilbur family papers and photographs, including a scrapbook of clippings, autograph books, and those pictures taken by Edith Wilbur Pollard's brother, Ralph Wilbur, who was a professional photographer, to the Griswold Historical Society. Of special interest were photographs of the Glasgo Yarn Mill and village of which the Wilbur's father James was superintendent, and which are all gone today. CHS deaccessioned some items to the Windham Historical Society, including a scrap book of clippings and photographs of the 1938 hurricane and the family's home at 230 Church St. in Willimantic, CT.</p>

<head>Biography</head>
<p>Evelyn Dimock Pollard was born February 5, 1915 in the house known today as the Brigham Tavern on the Boston Turnpike in Coventry, CT. Six generations of her family lived in that house and until about 1850 kept the Tavern there, until her father and mother Herbert D. and Edith (Wilbur) Pollard moved their branch of the family to 230 Church St. in Willimantic, CT where Evelyn lived for the rest of her life. She was a graduate of the Willimantic Normal School and Boston University and taught in the Weathersfield, CT school system for 47 years. She spent some of her retirement years working on the family genealogy.</p>
