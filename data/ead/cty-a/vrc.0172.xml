         <p>Slides are arranged by place, although many are unidentified. Educated guesses have been made as to where various scenes were taken, but no guarantee is made that they are all correctly categorized. The unidentified slides are separated into Unidentified Scenery, General Travel, Paintings &amp; Sculpture, and People.</p>
