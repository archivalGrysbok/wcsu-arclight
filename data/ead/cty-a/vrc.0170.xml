               <p>First is a postcard collection donated by Pamela Z. Blum in 1989 (ca. 220 postcards), all European painting, sculpture, and architecture, some sorted by location. Seond is a collection of souvenir postcard books of Italian cities (both art and architecture). The color in the images is lurid, with photography that seems to be from the 1900s through the 1950s. There are several fold-out views of cities such as Venice and Pompeii. The last collection (ca. 80 postcards) is an extremely mixed group of images of people from all over the world, ranging from Italians with donkey carts to Balinese women carrying jars on their heads. Many of them are very much of their era. Some appear to be original photos. This includes two postcard books from the Prado (Madrid, Spain) that contain reproductions of the "Cruzamiento de Razas en America."</p>

               <p>Views are mostly of Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain), with one book of Russia (post-revolution) and one of Algiers. Some of the books are missing postcards: one presumes they were mailed. Most appear to be from the early part of the 20th century.</p>

               <p>Postcards are roughly sorted by country. The dividers also include dates, but they seem to refer to the date the postcard was produced, rather than that of the building pictured. This box includes only France, which continues in the next box.</p>
