    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Leo D. Canine was a basset hound who belonged to Peter Dunbar, who lived with his parents David and Margaret Dunbar in a house neighboring the University. Leo was prone to getting loose and often spent time on campus with students. Leo was so frequently sighted and beloved that he became the mascot for the class of 1977. In the summer of 1978, students successfully enrolled Leo D. Canine in five engineering courses. The prank was not discovered until the bursar's office noticed that there was no zip code provided for the student. The prank, and Leo, received national attention as a result. Afterwards, students continued the prank by ordering magazine subscriptions and having mail sent to the University's address for Leo. Leo passed away in his sleep in January 1982 at about 15 years old.</p>  </bioghist>
