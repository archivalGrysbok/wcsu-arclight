    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Educational Main Street (EMS) was a program started by Superintendent Hernan LaFontaine and University President Humphrey Tonkin in 1990. The program was part of the President's office until 1996 when it moved to the College of Education, Nursing, and Health Professions, where it stayed until it closed in 2015.</p><p>The program trained University students to tutor schoolchildren in the Hartford area during and after school. University students could earn course-credit for their participation.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection came to the archives in no particular order. Some materials were together in large binders or folders. The binders oftentimes revolved around the same project or report in which case they were kept together in their order. Folders which contained various materials (forms and promotional materials which appeared to be for distribution as a packet) had some items removed, but the removed items were photocopied or at least documented.</p>  </processinfo>
