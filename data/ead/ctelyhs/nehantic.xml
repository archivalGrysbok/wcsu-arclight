<head>Biography</head>
<p>The Nehantic Indians were a tribe of Algonquian-speaking Native Americans living in southeastern Connecticut beginning around 10,000 years ago.  They were also known as the Niantic Indians.  The Niantics were divided into eastern and western divisions due to intrusions by the more powerful Pequots. During the Colonial Era, the Eastern Niantics lived near the mouth of the Connecticut River.</p>
