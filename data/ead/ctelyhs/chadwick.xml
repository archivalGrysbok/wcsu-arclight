<head>Biography</head>
<p>Charles Chadwick (September 9, 1803 - December 11, 1884) of Lyme, Connecticut sailed merchant ships as first mate from 1828-1845 and then as captain 1845-1851. He served as first mate on his elder brother Daniel Chadwick's packet ship "Wellington" several times.
Charles married Mary Rowland (May 3, 1804 - May 14, 1875) on August 24, 1830. They had one daughter Mary Amelia (September 24, 1833 - February 10, 1863) and three sons. The Chadwick letters were written while Charles was away at sea and Mary maintained their house and farm in Lyme.</p>
