<head>Biography</head>
<p>The federal government purchased 7.35 acres from Aaron Rabinowitz for $35,000 in 1955 which were used as a Nike station to protect Bridgeport industry during the Cold War. Mr. Rabinowitz was chairman of the board of the Fred F. French Investing Co. He founded the Tudor Foundation, in 1945, a charitable trust. The federal government released the Nike site land to the town of Westport in 1964. Mr. Rabinowitz's hope to donate $50,000 for a branch of the library to be built on the site in the name of Lillian Wald was not successful.</p>
