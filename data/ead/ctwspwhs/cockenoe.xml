<head>Biography</head>
<p>The earliest historical mention of Cockenoe was a 17th century reference to "Cochenoe's Island; so named after an indian, Cochenoe. In the 1960s, the island was owned by the United Illuminating Company. When UI announced plans to use the island as a base for a nuclear power plant, Westport citizens began a two year campaign to defeat the plan. The plan was defeated and the town of Westport bought the island. Thirty years later, September 12-13, 1997, Westport held an anniversary celebration of the Cockenoe Island victory.</p>
