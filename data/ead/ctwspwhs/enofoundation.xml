<head>Biography</head>
<p>William Phelps Eno was a wealthy Westport summer resident who gave up in real estate at age 41 to devote full time to traffic reform. At the time he began in 1889, there were no written traffic regulations and traffic regulations and traffic in cities everywhere was chaotic. He became the world's foremost authority on traffic reform. His rules were translated into many languages. In 1921, he established the Eno Foundation for Transportation which since his death has carried on his mission.</p>
