<head>Biography</head>
<p>Agriculture has played a significant role in the life of Westport from the time of the first settlers until the 20th century. The first white settlers farmed to feed their own families and livestock. But, by the end of the 18th century, residents on the east side of the Saugatuck River were growing onions for market.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 19th century, onion production was flourishing and the "Southport Globe Onion" was produced and widely sold. To serve the ships that went down the Saugatuck River carrying onions to market, wharves, warehouses and a tavern were established on the west side of the river in the area now known as Saugatuck.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, onion production began to decline. Labor shortages, disease and the rise of real estate values all contributed to this decline. By the end of the 19th century, onion farming had virtually disappeared as farmers turned to the production of perishable crops for local markets. With the post World War II housing boom, land became too valuable to be set aside for farming and the last of the big working farms shut down.</p>
