    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ralph C. Jenkins was born on December 3, 1891, in Springfield, Vermont. He earned his BA from Dartmouth College, MAs from Middlebury College and Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Doctorate from New York University. Through his doctoral research he became an outstanding authority on the life and works of Henry Barnard. Jenkins's writings include <title render="italic">A Practical Program for Teacher Training in Vermont, Henry Barnard, Progressive Educator of Teachers</title>, and, with Gertrude Warner, <title render="italic">Henry Barnard-An Introduction</title>.</p><p>After serving as principal of several high schools in Vermont, Jenkins came to Connecticut and was Superintendent of Schools in Putnam for three years and Plymouth for five years. He returned to Vermont as principal of the Johnson Normal School. In 1935 he became Principal of the Danbury Normal School, and, in 1937 became the first President of Danbury State Teacher's College.</p><p>As President of Danbury State Teacher's College, Jenkins worked with faculty to enlarge the curriculum, expand the library, and to promote the physical growth of the campus. One of Jenkins's priorities was to encourage men to enroll and enjoy the advantages Danbury Normal School had to offer in terms of a teaching career. Also, students were encouraged to stay in school and earn a "special" third year diploma that would enhance their training and thus become more desirable candidates for teaching positions. Soon thereafter students and faculty alike realized that a BA in education from the Danbury State Teacher's College was also needed. </p><p>Jenkins's interests were varied. He was active in many educational and civic organizations. In Danbury he was a Trustee of the library, a director of the Community Chest, and a prominent Rotarian, serving as District Governor of Rotary International in 1942. He also had a passion for music and sang in numerous church choirs. His love for music invariably carried over into the college where he felt the development of music ability and appreciation was important. He also had a keen interest in science and agriculture and was fascinated with the development of species and cultivation of a wide variety of vegetables and flowers. </p><p>Dr. Jenkins died on October 3, 1946. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The papers of Ralph C. Jenkins comprise one linear foot of materials and are arranged in two series: (1) Research Sources and Manuscript and (2) Books and Journals. The collection contains biographical and source materials on Henry Barnard, educator, editor, author, and lecturer collected from Ralph C. Jenkins who was President of Danbury State Teacher's College between 1935-1946. </p><p>The materials were collected in preparation for Jenkins's doctorial thesis <title render="italic">Henry Barnard Progressive Educator of Teacher. </title> The bulk of the collection consists of handwritten and typed excerpts of letters from the Monroe Collection at Couching Lion Farm, Waterbury, Vermont, that were sent to Barnard from educators across the country and Europe. Generally, the correspondents praise Barnard's works in educational reform and in some cases seek guidance to establish Normal Schools in their own states. Also included are excerpts from additional source materials, an array of pamphlets that contain Barnard's speeches as well as Connecticut School Documents praising him on his work in education reform that shaped the professional training of teachers. </p><p>Series 1 contains research sources and several drafts of Jenkins's manuscript.</p><p>Folders 10-15 contain Jenkins's first, second, and final draft of <title render="italic">Henry Barnard--Progressive Educator of Teachers. </title> The first and second drafts are comprised of typed excerpts from sources and arranged in a cut and paste format. Handwritten additions, marginal notes, and corrections along with preliminary chapter titles indicate these two drafts were a work in progress. Jenkins's final draft contains additional corrections and additions as well.</p><p>Series 2: Books and Journals. See container list for titles of journals and books contained in this collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
