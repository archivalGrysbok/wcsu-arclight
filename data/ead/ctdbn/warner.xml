    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Truman Augustine Warner, Jr. was born and raised in Danbury, Connecticut. He was educated in the Danbury public schools, and was one of the first men admitted to Danbury State Teachers College. After graduation in June 1941, Warner had to put his education and teaching career on hold when the army called him to serve in World War II. He served as medic with the 88th Infantry Division in North Africa and Italy and then was attached to the 81st Medical Base Depot (APO 772) in France and was put in charge of the B battery of the 450th AAA for a brief period. .His actions as a medic in the Italian campaign brought him a battlefield commission to Lieutenant and commendations for bravery.</p><p>Upon his return from the War, Warner began taking courses at Columbia for his Master's in history and doctorate in education and anthropology. During this time he also taught high school in Old Lyme, Connecticut, and in Briarcliff, New York. Warner returned to his alma mater in 1958 as Dean of Admissions, and after several years he began teaching in the Social Science Department. He served as Chairman of the joint Department of History and Social Sciences, introduced courses in non-western cultures, and taught his specialty, Japanese History and Culture. </p><p>Warner was also a board member and former president of the Scott-Fanton Museum, now known as the Danbury Museum and Historical Society. During his tenure, he supervised and contributed to numerous museum exhibits.</p><p>When he retired in 1995, after 37 years as a teacher and administrator, he received the University's first Presidential Service Medal. Also, a scholarship was created in his name that is given annually to an undergraduate student majoring in Social Science or History.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Warner Collection consists of writings and research notes and papers reflecting Warner's career as an author, historian and historical researcher. The bulk of the collection contains an extensive series of newspaper clippings and printed materials relating to local and state history, and several boxes that contain information on Western's faculty, administration, and events concerning the school's history beginning in the 1940s and continuing through to the late 1990s. Warner's subject headings and filing system were retained wherever possible during processing the collection.</p><p>Warner's personal research notes and papers relate directly to his search for source materials in libraries, archives, and in private hands for his proposed book on the history of Danbury. The collection traces Danbury's social and anthropological history noting the patterns and catalysts of change beginning in pre-colonial times to the late 20th century. The main focus is on local and regional society and culture, religion, families, economic growth and development, and government.</p><p>His personal papers include correspondence with family members, personal friends, and colleagues, his education and historical writings, and World War II memorabilia that includes maps, war pamphlets, medical handbooks, and a scrapbook containing photographs of military friends and excursions while serving as a medic during the Italian campaign. This scrapboook was scanned in 2009 and links to the scans are listed in the inventory (Series III, subseries 9).</p><p>Warner's personal correspondence files include an extensive series of letters written to his parents during World War II that chronicle his basic training, ocean voyage to North Africa aboard a troop ship, through the Mediterranean to Italy, and then to France. Many of his letters contain detailed descriptions of the countryside and local inhabitants. According to Army regulations, letters from family and friends were destroyed after being read, but a few letters did survive and can be found in folders 2, 3 and 4. Additional information regarding Warner's wartime experiences can be found in an oral history interview conducted by a student for an historical research assignment. Warner discusses circumstances and events that were not included in his letters to his parents.</p><p>The Sources and Book series contain extensive personal research notes, copies of diaries and church records, indexes, newspaper clippings, and other source materials for his proposed book on the history of Danbury. The Book series is divided into several chapter and subject headings indicating it was a work in progress. Information in the Danbury History/Theory series is focused on scientific theories, paradigms, social science, and the scientific method. </p><p>Warner's Postcard Collection contains postcards from all over the United States as well as Europe that were sent to Warner and his family or bought as souvenirs while on vacation.

"General Tom Thumb" and his wife Lavinia Warren.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref693_en1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Connecticut Fairs</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1996" type="inclusive">1965-1996</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_5dbd9f928d20c170ba71fce010c28c37" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_6db84667cbba109753d4703b3e7eb46e" parent="aspace_5dbd9f928d20c170ba71fce010c28c37" type="folder">6</container></did><odd id="aspace_5d6da089af84bae11f9b4b233047cf45"><head>General note</head><p>Minor articles on Old Roxbury Days Fair and the Bridgewater Agricultural Fair.</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref695_eq0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Fair Postcards</unittitle><unitdate normal="1938/1986" type="inclusive">1938-1986</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_7305e2d9a0ef472f9c647950c0f4b9ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_c6af444a6704e5b6e8be06de15cddd7b" parent="aspace_7305e2d9a0ef472f9c647950c0f4b9ba" type="folder">7</container></did><odd id="aspace_ceb47861a203370ae72dd40032db4145"><head>General note</head><p>Seven original colored postcards: Fair Grounds (3); General View, Danbury Fair Grounds (1); Danbury Fair from Grandstand (1); Midway, Danbury Fair on Thursday (1); and, Horse Races (1).</p></odd></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref697_de3" level="file"><did><unittitle>"The Great Danbury State Fair" <title render="italic">News-Times</title> Commemorative Issue 1869-1981.</unittitle><unitdate normal="1981/1981" type="inclusive">1981</unitdate><container altrender="Oversize (25 x 19 x 3&amp;quot;)" id="aspace_ebad7088179dcef452a6d73b85283adb" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">OS 1</container><container id="aspace_fdf0f85c09d3fb01e89c0900f3ecfce7" parent="aspace_ebad7088179dcef452a6d73b85283adb" type="folder">*</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref698_yfl" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Agricultural Society Annual Fair (original)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1937/1937" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_8b2e56f0847e80c30051c4cc542f5031" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_c5a4b515bfbc71bc2db66ec8c433ecd7" parent="aspace_8b2e56f0847e80c30051c4cc542f5031" type="folder">8</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref699_uvu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Fair Auto Race Program (original)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1937/1937" type="inclusive">1937</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_c13853ec0ac3db1afa1b810d6f52bcbb" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_05838fc7b9c26d958102c3a4ff3de291" parent="aspace_c13853ec0ac3db1afa1b810d6f52bcbb" type="folder">9</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref700_yw3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Fair Programs (originals)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1976/1978" type="inclusive">1976-1978</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_8a2a1f563087a459e6907f707ca785db" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_ed1196d77cb99707c337a8e9b954dd3f" parent="aspace_8a2a1f563087a459e6907f707ca785db" type="folder">10</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref701_rva" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Fair Programs (originals)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1980/1981" type="inclusive">1980-1981</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_e657de6b3836724db14aa510b02808d7" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_0f453d2839fd94680257ee0b47e055d1" parent="aspace_e657de6b3836724db14aa510b02808d7" type="folder">11</container></did></c03><c03 id="aspace_ref702_98x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Danbury Fair</unittitle><unitdate normal="1938/1996" type="inclusive">1938-1996</unitdate><container altrender="Record Center Box" id="aspace_a2aba1f62f09253cbac9432adc3338e3" label="Mixed Materials" type="box">12</container><container id="aspace_d568e964c0311057ec747ea95da36363" parent="aspace_a2aba1f62f09253cbac9432adc3338e3" type="folder">12-24</container></did><odd id="aspace_811c72393f828a19f70f975a5a98f254"><head>General note</head><p>Articles and research notes on the history, events and general development of the Danbury Fair from a purely agricultural event in 1869 to its more modern theme park atmosphere at the close in 1981.
