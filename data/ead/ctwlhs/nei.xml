<abstract label="Abstract">The Wilton Historical Society Neighborhoods and Old Houses Collection contains draft survey forms, index photographs, research notes, and other documentation relating (for houses) to date of construction, ownership history, major renovations, and relocations, and (for neighborhoods) dates of settlement, the names of founding and notable residents, prevailing economic activities and local businesses, the origins of local names, and the history of local roads. The information available for individual houses and neighborhoods varies widely. The earliest items date to the 1730s, but the bulk of the collection is mid- to late twentieth century.</abstract>

<head>History</head>
<p>1. Wilton Historical Society Neighborhoods and Old Houses Collection</p>
<p>The Wilton Historical Society, founded in 1938, has collected materials and sponsored research relating to individual Wilton houses, particularly colonial and Victorian structures. Additions have been made by Carol Russell, Wilton Historical Society Archivist and Wilton Town Historian. Much of the material in the collection are the notes and draft reports of local researchers (notably Malcolm Hunt of the Lockwood House Museum, Norwalk, Conn.) and architectural historians (such as Mary McCahon, who headed the 1989 Cultural Resource Survey of Wilton). In conjunction with a new historical resource survey in 2017, the Wilton Historical Society Old Houses and Neighborhoods Collection will be expanding to include historically important, architecturally significant, and particularly well-preserved Wilton houses from the 1920s through the 1940s.</p>
<p>2. Wilton History Room</p>
<p>The Wilton History Room is a unique collaboration between the Wilton Historical Society (WHS) and the Wilton Library Association (WLA). Compiled beginning in 1938, the archival collections of the Wilton Historical Society had been stored in the 18th century Fitch House. In 1980, the officers and trustees of the WHS, in conversation with the director and board members of the WLA, determined that a climate controlled space, improved organization, and better public accessibility were necessary; and so in January 1984 they established a home for the collection in the Wilton Library. Organization of the collections was supported by the Cudlipp Memorial Fund and undertaken by Carol Russell. The Wilton Historical Society has retained its ownership, while the Wilton Library maintains the collections, and provides access and assistance to patrons. </p>
<p>The Wilton History Room is one of the most complete, organized, and well-staffed historical research facilities, for a town of our size, in Fairfield County. It is supported by the WHS, the WLA, The Russell Fund, The History Room Fund, local non-profit organizations, individual donors, and community volunteers. </p>
<p>Today, the original archival collections of the WHS take up half of the Wilton History Room. Another quarter are library items. The collected papers of local organizations comprise the remainder: Cannon Grange, Children's Theater, Daughters of the American Revolution, Hurlbutt Street School House Association, Kiwanis Club, League of Women Voters, Rotary Club, Town Association, Weir Farm Stewardship Committee, Wilton Garden Club, Wilton Land Conservation Trust, Wilton Library, Wilton Playshop, Wilton Woman's Club, and more.</p>

<head>Scope and Content of Collection</head>
<p>The Wilton Historical Society Neighborhoods and Old Houses Collection contains architectural and historical information about Wilton's old houses and early neighborhoods. The oldest Wilton houses documented in the collection date to the early 1700s, when colonial structures were first built here by land proprietors and farmers from Norwalk. The bulk of Wilton houses in the collection, however, were built between the mid-1700s and the mid- to late 1800s. New additions to the collection, for historically and/or architecturally significant or particularly well-preserved houses built between the 1920s and the 1940s, are being made with the assistance of architectural historians conducting a new historical resource survey of Wilton.   </p>
<p>Neighborhoods in the collection include: Bald Hill, Belden Hill, Cannondale, Chestnut Hill, Chicken Street, Comstock Ridge, Cottage Row, Danbury Road, Drum Hill, Dumplin Hill, Georgetown, Glen Hill, Grumman Hill, Hurlbutt, Kent, Nod Hill, Olmstead Hill, Pimpewaug, Prink's Plain, Ridgefield Road, Seir Hill, Sharp Hill, and Wilton Center.</p>
<p>Roads -- along with their select associated houses -- in the collection include: Belden Hill, Cannon, Cedar, Center, Chestnut Hill, Chicken, Church, Cottage Row, Danbury, DeForest, Drum Hill, East Meadow, Grumman Hill, Hubbard, Honey Hill, Hurlbutt, Kensett, Lover's Lane, Millstone, Mountain, Newtown Turnpike, Nod Hill, Old Belden, Old Boston, Old Mill, Old Ridgefield, Olmstead Hill, Own Home, Partrick, Pimpewaug, Pond, Ridgefield, Ruscoe, Scribner, Seeley, Seir Hill, Sharp Hill, Skunk, Sturges Ridge, West Church, West Meadow, Westport, Whipstick, and Wolfpit.</p>

<head>Related Collections</head>
<p>Researchers interested in the history, locations, and boundaries of Wilton family properties and homes, or in Wilton neighborhoods, roads, and place-names, should also consult the Wilton History Room's other collections, particularly Maps and Manuscripts. Property histories of select Wilton families and individuals are narrated in Robert Russell's Wilton, Connecticut: Three Centuries of People, Places, and Progress. The Card File is also helpful in locating specific family names in the Norwalk Land Records. Finally, there are a number of pamphlets available in the History Room that researchers into Wilton neighborhoods and old houses will find useful, notably the three volume Annals of Wilton series published by the Wilton Historical Society between 1940 and 1971, and another published by the Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk for the 1978-1980 architectural survey, Wilton Architecturally Speaking (1980).</p>

<p>Select additional information as well as a large collection of artifacts drawn from many of the houses in the Wilton Historical Society Neighborhoods and Old Houses Collection may be seen at the Wilton Historical Society Museum. Legal documents after 1802 relating to property and house ownership and usage rights, including deeds and titles, are held in Wilton's Town Clerk's Office. Documentation prior to 1802 may be found in Norwalk.</p>
