            <p>The local "Y" groups, however, disbanded in the late 1930s. Concerned for local youth, B'nai B'rith proposed in 1938 the formation of a community center, but it was not until 1942 that a Jewish Center Association was organized. Under the sponsorship of the United Jewish Social Service and the Community Chest, recreational programs were provided on Vine Street.</p>
            <p>In 1948, the Jewish Federation, which had been organized in 1945, purchased a building on Asylum Avenue for a Community Center. Initially the Center concentrated on youth recreation at the Center itself, but gradually it expanded to a summer camp and activities for adults of all ages. In 1959, with an expanding membership and the westward movement of the Jewish population, the Community Center began planning for a new home. The Jewish Community Center on Bloomfield Avenue, designed by internationally acclaimed architect Walter Gropius, was completed in 1962. A major building addition was added in 1990.</p>
