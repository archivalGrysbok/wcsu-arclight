            <p>Thur Hewitt wanted to join the United States Navy at the age of 16. However, because of age restrictions, he had to alter the date of birth on his birth certificate in order to join. When he was found out, the Navy asked him to leave and return on his 17th birthday. Hewitt was anxious to get out on the sea, so he joined the Merchant Marines for a year. On his 17th birthday he returned to enlist in the navy. He went to boot camp in Bainbridge, MD, where the sailors learned a great deal about discipline. Hewitt was sent to Shanghai, where the sailors were made part of the crew of the USS Los Angeles, where his division of 11 men were designated as navigators. Hewitt was injured in Tsingtao, China, when he and his division were guarding an ammunition depot. Shortly after this, the USS Los Angeles was sent to Hawaii for a short time. At this time Hewitt began to work on a submarine base. When his ship began making the journey toward Japan for the invasion in August of 1945 the Atomic bomb was dropped before they arrived. When they returned, the sailors were asked if they would like to reenlist, and although Hewitt had intended to make a career out of the navy, he wanted to return home to see his family for a time. Upon his return home, he met his wife, and decided not to join for another tour.</p>
