            <p>Gladys Donovan was living in East Hartford, CT when she decided to enlist in the United States Army. She wanted to do her part to help the war effort. She was sent to basic training in Fort Oglethorpe, GA, and then later to Stephen F. Austin College to take administrative courses. In just six weeks she was expected to learn 56 subjects pertaining to administrative services. She then began working at Camp Blanding in Florida. Her first job at Camp Blanding was in the discharge area, where she conducted interviews with the soldiers who were being sent home. Donovan stresses that this was a very difficult job, as it was hard to speak to the soldiers that had been disabled because of the war. She was then moved to the payroll department, where she took on additional responsibilities and increases in rank. When she was discharged from the army in February of 1946, it was as a staff sergeant. Just a few weeks after returning home she was hired at the VA in Hartford. She later joined the VFW, becoming Auxiliary President, and the American Legion, where she was elected President.</p>
