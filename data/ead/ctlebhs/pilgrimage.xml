<head>Biography</head>
<p>In the years after WWII, the Lebanon Foundation sponsored a series of historical pageants which featured an epic play about the founding of the United States and a Boy Scout (and eventually Girl Scout) camporee on the Lebanon Green.  Professionally produced and directed, Lebanon residents filled many of the roles in this production.  Memorabilia, preserved in various households, was donated to the Historical Society beginning years before collections records were kept.</p>
<p>The Lebanon Foundation of New London identified itself as an organization founded to inspire Americanism; combatting the present day influences of Communism and fellow travelers; and for the restoration of Lebanon. The purpose is to forcibly bring to all, particularly through the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, a realization that our Americanism and happiness rest only in and as a result of sacrifice and hard work.</p>
