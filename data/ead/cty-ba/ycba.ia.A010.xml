         <p>Paul Mellon (1907-1999) was the son of businessman and former Secratary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon. He developed a love for British art, literature and sport as a young man and these interests permeated his adult life and philanthropic pursuits. Mellon was a graduate of Yale College ('29) and Cambridge University where he deepened his knowlegde of British Literature. In 1966, he bequeathed his extensive collection of British art and rare books to Yale University, and an endowment that established the Yale Center for British Art, which opened to the public in 1977.</p>
         <p>The Yale Center for British Art was designed by the American architect Louis I. Kahn (1901-1974) and completed after his death.  The Center was Kahn's final work and is located across the street from his first commission, the Yale University Art Gallery (opened in 1953).  The Center has a sleek, modern aesthetic, and it is the first museum in the United States with incorporated retail space.  Notable elements of the design include the juxtaposition of materials similar in color and texture, such as the glass and steel on the fa√ßade, the strong geometry of the interior, and the many windows that bathe objects in diffused natural light.  In 2005, the Center was awarded the Twenty-Five Year Award by the American Institute of Architects.</p>
         <p>The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, founded in 1970, is an educational charity committed to supporting original research into the history of British art and architecture of all periods. The Centre contains an extensive library and manuscript collection, with over 12,000 books about British art. It is the sister institution to the Yale Center for British Art, with which it collaborates closely, and is part of Yale University.</p>
