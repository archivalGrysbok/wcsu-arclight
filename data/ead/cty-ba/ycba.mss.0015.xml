         <p>
            <emph render="smcaps">Charles Robert Leslie</emph> (19 October 1794- 5 May 1859) was born in London to American parents, Robert Charles (d. 1804) and Lydia Leslie (ca. 1766-1824). His father was a prosperous Philadelphia clockmaker who moved his family to England in 1793 to expand his business. The Leslies' time in America was short-lived, however, and they returned to Philadelphia in 1799. Charles showed an early talent for drawing, which was fostered through classes taken at the University of Pennsylvania at the young age of ten. Upon his father's death in 1804, however, the family encountered financial hardships and there were no funds with which to further Charles's artistic education.</p>
         <p>In 1808, he became a publisher's apprentice at the press of Bradford and Inskeep in Philadelphia. A senior partner of the firm, after seeing a promising watercolor that Leslie had made of actor Frederick Cooke, helped him to enroll at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The senior partner, Samuel Bradford, also raised money to help send Charles to London for artistic training. The Academy was impressed with Charles's work and, in addition to accepting him as a student, helped to support his study abroad. Those in America who saw Charles's paintings were struck with their potential and fervently supported his pursuit of a career in painting.</p>
         <p>Once he arrived in London in 1811, Charles Robert Leslie was instructed and strongly influenced by Benjamin West, the president of the Royal Academy, as well as Washington Allston and Samuel F.B. Morse (who, although then studying painting, would go on to fame as the inventor of Morse code). Morse and Leslie were students together at the Royal Academy, where Leslie had enrolled in 1813. Although his American-born mentors were history painters, Leslie's longstanding interest in the stage remained a prevalent feature of his work.</p>
         <p>Leslie traveled to France in 1817, accompanied by his friend, William Collins (who would become the father of writer Wilkie Collins), and his mentor, Washington Allston. Collins was a close associate of the successful painter, David Wilkie, whose genre paintings were garnering considerable attention and praise. While painting portraits to support himself and to keep his work in public view, Leslie took note of genre painting and began to move into this field. Allston helped to secure work for Leslie as an illustrator of Washington Irving's works, <title render="italic">
               Knickerbocker's History of New York
            </title> and <title render="italic">
               The Sketch Book
            </title>. Leslie would carry on his friendship with Washington Irving for the rest of his life.</p>
         <p>In 1819, Leslie exhibited his painting, <title render="italic">
               Sir Roger de Coverley Going to Church
            </title>, a genre piece that received a  favorable response. Leslie continued creating literary genre paintings throughout the next several years, becoming a member of the Royal Academy in 1826. By 1820, Leslie, who had been supported by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Arts throughout his tenure in England, decided to stay in London. He married Harriet Honor Stone (1799-1879) in 1825. Together, they would have six children, including George Dunlop Leslie, who became a celebrated genre painter like his father. Among Leslie's other children, his son Robert Charles and daughter Mary would also follow his footsteps into painting and book illustration.</p>
         <p>Leslie's trajectory of success was stymied, to some extent, in 1833, when his brother Tom, who had made a career in the U.S. Army, obtained a position for Leslie at West Point Academy in New York. Leslie was eventually persuaded to travel to the United States to take the post as a drawing teacher, but he and his family remained there only five months, suffering through a bitter winter and various disappointments. They returned to London in 1834.</p>
         <p>Despite the hardships of the brief stint at West Point, Leslie would receive his most important commission just a few years later, in 1838. Patrons Baron and Lady Holland arranged for him to attend the coronation of Queen Victoria. The Queen ultimately commissioned Leslie's picture of the event, entitled <title render="italic">
               Queen Victoria Receiving the Sacrament After the Coronation
            </title>. She would also commission a second piece in 1841, this time depicting the christening of the Princess Royal. The royal commissions were career-making events for Leslie, who went on to paint further genre and literary works on commission for the rest of his life and to become a professor of painting at the Royal Academy in 1847. He moved in influential creative circles, both artistic and literary. Before his death in 1859, Leslie published a biography of Sir John Constable, a <title render="italic">
               Handbook for Young Painters
            </title>, and began work on his autobiography as well as on a work about Sir Joshua Reynolds. The latter two books were published posthumously. C.R. Leslie was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. His art hangs in museum and private collections on both sides of the Atlantic, testifying to his successful negotiation of the American and British worlds of early nineteenth century painting.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="smcaps">Mary Leslie</emph> (1833-1907) was the fifth child of Charles Robert and Harriet Honor Leslie. She showed a keen artistic talent, and became a book illustrator. She remained unmarried throughout her life, living with her mother and sister Harriet after her father's death. Her sister died in 1864, and her mother in 1884. Mary appears to have had some kind of mental or neurological health crisis around this time. In 1891, she is listed as a boarder at a home in Berkshire, near the residence of her brother George. Strikingly, she is recorded as an "imbecile" in this census, and a nurse, Bessie Robertson, is shown in the same household. By 1901, Mary had moved into George's home, Riverside, in Berkshire, and is again listed as an "imbecile" in that year's census. A slightly cryptic note in one of Mary's sketchbooks, penned by her brother George, says that in later life Mary's "balance had gone" and that she only had one eye. Mary Leslie died in 1907, in Lindfield, Sussex, England.</p>

         <p>The collection comprises sketchbooks, writings, and correspondence by Charles Robert Leslie (1794-1859) and his family. Leslie was known best for his paintings of literary subjects, although his oeuvre included portraiture, history paintings, and selected literary works. The collection was compiled by Leslie's son, George Dunlop Leslie, also a celebrated genre painter, and represents the years, 1812 to 1900. The collection includes documents related to Leslie's wife, Harriet, as well as some of his children, Mary, Harriet, George, and Robert Charles. Additional materials include correspondence from Tom Taylor and Peter Powell, representing some of Leslie's most important professional and personal relationships.</p>
         <p>The largest portion of correspondence comprises letters from Leslie's wife, Harriet. The letters were originally placed in a paper folder (appearing to date from the time of George Dunlop's selection of these items) with a note reading, "Letters cheifly [sic] from Mrs Leslie to C.R. Leslie RA mostly from different sea-side places. Broadstairs, Benbridge, Brighton, etc. dates between 1836 1850. also some from the children at the same time to their father C.R. Leslie./ also a few answers from CRL/ very amusing &amp; characteristic examined &amp; selected by G.D. Leslie 1898."</p>

                  <p>Texts include: "Extracts from Grose's <title render="italic">

                  <p>The volume include 15 drawings in graphite and 39 drawings in pen and black ink. Accompanying the extracts from Grose's <title render="italic">
                        Antiquities
                     </title> are a number of full-page drawings, in graphite, of men in military costume, along with depictions of various weaponry and armor. The ink drawings primarily depict figures in historical dress. It's possible that some of these are depictions of characters from the stage.</p>

                  <p>The spine of the volume bears a paper label inscribed: "Sketches by C.R. Leslie, R.A., selected by G.D.L. [i.e. George Dunlop Leslie] '06."</p>
                  <p>The album comprises 103 drawings or groups of drawings by Leslie, all on small sheets affixed to blank leaves in the album. These includes 66 drawings in pen and ink (frequently over graphite) and 37 drawings in graphite; 8 of the drawings include some addition of watercolor.</p>
                  <p>Most drawings are unsigned and without labels. There are a number of quickly drawn studies of men and women in common dress. A series of drawings near the front depict various ensembles of figures dancing; one of these is labeled "Espaja [?] Spy glass." As in the preceding C.R. Leslie sketchbook in this collection, a number of the drawings depict figures in historical costume, especially of the 17th century. Some of these may be depictions of characters from the stage. Titled portraits depict the likes of John Constable, Richard Fanshawe, William Duke of Hamilton, David Leslie, and Catherine of Aragon; most (if not all) of these are copies.</p>

                  <p>The album is inscribed at front: "Eleven drawings &amp; two cuttings, 1865." In fact, the album comprises 16 drawings and two cut-paper works, to which have been inserted three additional sheets containing five more drawings. About half of the drawings are finished in watercolor. Most of the drawings depict young ladies in various fashions; some depict children. The two cut-paper works depict a wading bird and a semi-abstract collection of flowers. At the end is tipped in a printed page of "Isabella, or The pot of basil, a story from Bocaccio."</p>

                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                  <p>This small sketchbook contains 72 mounted illustrations, which include pen and ink drawings, graphite sketches, watercolors, and cut-paper works.</p>
                  <p>The cut-paper works include finely detailed textual and graphic pieces, such as a small mounted image of flowers and thistles which bears the legend, "Dieu et mon Droit." Another cut out piece depicts the scene of a hunt (perhaps inspired by the paintings of Stubbs), with a ferocious lion leaping to sink his teeth into a racing antelope.</p>
                  <p>Mary Leslie's watercolor illustrations include a charming depiction of a small grey and black striped cat sitting by  beehives in a colorful stylized garden. Attention to composition, color, and detail are clear in this small image, created as though in the form of a panel illustration.</p>
                  <p>Tiny graphite and pen and ink panel-style drawings, some of which were eventually published, show animals and pastoral scenes. A quartet of tiny mounted panels shows antelope or deer fleeing a hunter's arrow, sheep grazing peacefully by night, a squirrel holding an acorn, and a shepherd with his flock. All of the images are composed with a view to their decorative effect, tightly structured and arranged within miniscule rectangular spaces.</p>
                  <p>Mary's marine landscapes and studies of shells in graphite and watercolor show a sophisticated grasp of natural subjects.</p>
                  <p>The album also includes graphite illustrations of biblical scenes, such as Noah releasing the dove from the ark and the infant Moses discovered in a basket. Composition and technique--tight structure, emphasis on surfaces and draped human figures, for example--may evidence some influence from contemporary Victorian art, such as that of the pre-Raphaelites or the St. John's Wood Clique, of which her brother George was a member.</p>
                  <p>George Dunlop Leslie included a couple of notes in ink, written on pages of the album, to indicate further information about his sister's work. On a page of mounted miniature panels and motifs, he writes, "These and those on the following Pages are designs for 'Breaks' for a work on the 'Song of the three children' published by J. Murray (in wood cut)."</p>
                  <p>There are a few charming graphite images of women and children. One image shows a mother feeding her child at a table. A small sketch mounted just below shows a toddler grasping a kitten around the neck. A later image shows a young woman holding a book. She wears an elaborate dotted dress, with frilled cuffs. The clothing depicted in these scenes suggests that they date from the 1860s.</p>
                  <p>A series of intricate paper cut outs is labeled, by George, as follows: "These cut paper designs were done quite late in her life when her balance was gone, they show however how true her artistic power remained. They were cut out <emph render="underline">without</emph> any preliminary drawing. She had but one eye but her eyesight must have been marvelous/ GDL."</p>

                  <p>Manuscript treatise, bound by hand. Mary Leslie declares, "I am going to lay before you...my inexpeareanced [sic] thoughts on the subject of painting." It is likely that Mary created this piece while still a young child. She writes of her previous ignorance, looking at "those unatureal [sic] painters, Landsear [sic], Redgrave, Danby, and many others..." Mary goes on to praise Raphael for his lack of affectation, and then speaks warmly of Turner and Constable, writing that she has heard people say that "Constable painted, silver. Turner painted, Gold" [sic] as a way of comparing the two. She concludes by saying that she has other thoughts on the subject of painting, but they are difficult to write down.</p>

                  <p>Attributed to George Leslie but bearing strong resemblances to the work of Mary Leslie, this manuscript appears to be a mockup for an unpublished edition of Chaucer's poem, "The Flower and the Leaf." The poem is copied out by hand in a small, cursive hand, and each page has illustrated panels depicting scenes from the poem, with decorative borders. The intricate details and carefully drawn figures in medieval costume evoke the Victorian fascination and interpretation of medieval aesthetics. Naturalistic embellishments in the page borders, including drawings of flowers, birds, insects, and reeds at water's edge, are done in a careful and moderately skillful hand.</p>

                     <p>Bradford Leslie writes to his brother George, including a comical sketch of pigs lolling in the grass. He comments on the "porkers," saying that they "will explain to you how hot it is here." It is likely that this letter was written while Bradford was completing his engineering apprenticeship; he mentions the town of St. Briavels, which is in Gloucestershire, not far from Chepstow, where Bradford would go in 1851-2 as part of his apprenticeship. Bradford comments on the animals he sees in the area, as well as on the rock in the region, which he says is called "pudding stone." He notes the cheapness of the home prices in the town and remarks that he wants to make a "rod" out of sticks he has found.</p>

                     <p>The letter is sent from No. 82, Great Titchfield Street, Fitzroy Square, addressed to Thomas Leslie at Number 48 South Sixth Street, Philadelphia. Charles writes a lengthy letter to his brother, telling him of his experiences in London during his artistic training. He acknowledges a recent letter from Thomas that arrived on the <emph render="italic">Anna Maria</emph> and makes some remarks and inquiries about mutual acquaintances, mentioning a captain who is sailing to America and a picture that Thomas is obtaining from Sully (i.e. Thomas Sully?), as well as a picture offered by Carpenter. He jokingly sends his love to a woman described as his "destined bride," suggesting that a woman in Philadelphia believes that they have formed an attachment that does not exist. Leslie writes of taking lodgings with "Mr [Samuel F.B.] Morse a son of the celebrated geographer." He writes of his deep friendship with Morse, with whom he lives "like brothers." Leslie goes on to describe his living arrangement and routine dining. He mentions dining "a few days ago with Mr [Benjamin] West" and a few other people; their party "consisted [mostly] of Americans." Leslie comments that West mentions a "tavern in Strawberry Alley" where "two of his early pictures" are and where he first "discovered a taste for painting." Leslie describes West's upcoming project of a "picture of Christ before Pilate," anticipating it to be "equal to any thing of Raphael's or Michael Angelo's." Leslie plans to draw a bust of West, which Morse has recently bought, and send it to Thomas.</p>
                     <p>Leslie goes on to mention that West has given him "a note of introduction to Fuseli at the Royal Academy." He notes, however, that he does not go often to the academy because, "the accommodations for students are so very bad...the figures [for drawing] are discoloured, the room so badly lighted that you can't see the outline distinctly, and generally very crowded with students..." He says that he and Morse often draw from casts at home, returning them for half price when they are through with them. Leslie writes of trying to visit the Horse Armoury (at the Tower of London), but being charged full price and then being denied permission to make sketches.</p>
                     <p>Leslie reports having gone to see "Mr Barker's panoramas, the seige [sic] of Flushing, and Bay of Messina they are so well painted as to be quite deception [sic], particularly the latter one, as they extend in a circular form all round the rooms and the spectators are placed in the center the effect is very astonishing, I actually put on my hat imagining myself to be in the open air." He comments that the painting is so effective that it was impossible to tell how far the canvas was from him, seeming even "thirty miles off" at one point.</p>
                     <p>Charles writes that he has not been much to the theater, as it is repetitive and he is tired of pantomimes. He writes that "Mrs Siddons is to quit the stage after this season," and is currently performing in Edinburgh. "When she returns," he vows, "I shall go almost every night, as I never expect to see such another woman."</p>
                     <p>Leslie mentions some new acquaintances in Turnham Green, including a family called the Collets and a Dr Rogers. He notes that a Mr Jennings in London, a "picture cleaner," remembers his father and has emigrated from Philadelphia himself. He also mentions a family called the Earles and a Miss Daghton, "daughter of the actor of that name," and sister to a painter who has won a prize at the academy. Leslie writes of a Mr Alston, "a young American artist of very fine talents," with whom he and Morse spend time.</p>
                     <p>Leslie writes of a "new play by Reynolds...called the 'Origin of the Sun.'" He mentions some current reviews of the play and assures Thomas that he will soon be able to see it "on the other side of the water."</p>
                     <p>Leslie notes British opinion of the way "Congress are proceeding," and mentions that he is glad of the "spirit" of his "countrymen." He plans to stay in London even if "any thing serious should take place," but fears being cut off from contact with his family and friends. He hopes that the current tension is "only talk" and will be resolved when "the Prince Regent comes to the full exercise of his powers" later in the month.</p>
                     <p>Leslie notes that he has already sent a letter "to Mama," with "sketches of Mrs Siddons &amp; Kemble," and then includes a sketch for Thomas in this letter. The title is obscured, however. He mentions having also written to Betsy with "the notes of 'Soldier Rest'."</p>
                     <p>Leslie comments that "[t]here were six people hung here a few days ago and not one of them for murder," and remarks on the high crime rate in London. He asks Thomas to relay some messages and his affection to mutual friends and family members. He asks for Thomas to write him long letters and to include "every little thing that you can relate," as he is hungry for news of home and knows that Thomas does not have as many correspondents expecting letters as he himself, being abroad, does.</p>

                     <p>The letter is postmarked from Petworth on 27/28 May, 1834 and is addressed to "Mrs. Leslie" at 41 Portman Place, Edgware Road, London. Leslie writes to his wife about his ride to the area, saying that it was quite dusty. He may have been traveling in order to fulfill a commission, possibly to paint portraits. He describes meeting a Mrs. Rydsdale and her children at the house where he is staying, commenting that she will be "delighted at the prospect of seeing you soon again." Leslie also writes of being received by Lord Egremont, seeing a Mrs. King and her children, a Colonel Henry, Lady George Townshead [?], Lady Emily and the Miss Rydsdales. He also mentions a Mr. Morrison as being "the gentleman for whom I <emph render="underline">did not</emph> paint a picture..." He writes of missing his wife and of trying to get home as soon as possible. It seems that Harriet might have been ill or have been burdened with caring for her growing family at this time, for Leslie advises her with great emphasis to take care of herself and to rest as much as possible while he is away. He describes some sort of enormous fete in town, at which "4 or 5 thousand" women and children came to dine and were waited upon by men. He closes by commenting somewhat cryptically on a person in the household (perhaps a servant?) called "Cupid" who asks about the family but who may have a "rival in New York."</p>

                     <p>Leslie and his wife write to their daughter from Brussels, where they are staying. Leslie writes first, commenting on the impressive Catholic churches and services there, and in particular on the music. He goes into great detail about the various services and forms of music performed in church. He includes a description and small ink sketch of a figure representing the Virgin Mary, over whose head "is a large halo of silver stars." He also writes of visiting the Royal Castle of Laeken, saying of "the palace of Leopold" that "as he is at present there, we could only see the outside which is very handsome." Leslie expresses disappointment that "we have not seen many first rate pictures," but he hopes to see some later on when he and his wife travel to Cologne, Frankfort, Holland, and back to Belgium to see Antwerp. Harriet Stone Leslie then takes over the pen and inquires about her daughter's health and the situation at home. She comments briefly on what souvenirs she is contemplating purchasing for the children. A final note, seemingly in C.R. Leslie's hand, appears at the very end of the letter, penned on May 15th. The letter is postmarked May 15, 1844 and sent to Harriet Leslie at 12 Pine Apple Place, Edgware Road, London.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes to her parents from school, thanking them for their letter and wishing she could be home. She expresses desire to see "the telescope" and "dear little baby," who may be George Dunlop Leslie. She reports having been on several walks for "blackberrying" and says that there are several new girls at school this quarter. She again writes of missing her family and wanting to "nurse the baby." She includes Caroline's love in closing the letter.</p>
                     <p>On the last two pages of the letter is a cross-written note from an adult, signed "S. __tforth (possibly Cutforth?)." The letter has been addressed in this adult's hand to "Mr. Leslie," care of the "Earl of Egremont, Petworth, Sussex." The writer seems to be a Quaker and addresses Leslie as "Dear Friend," referring to him as "thee" throughout. The writer discusses the children's good behavior and comments on clothing purchased recently for them and that they will require in the future. Some sort of travel arrangement to London is also discussed. It is not clear what the relationship of this person is to Harriet or her school in Berkhamsted. The date on the letter, also in this writer's hand, is written out as "9th of 10th mo, 1835," suggesting the Quaker tendency not to use month names.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes her parents from school in Berkhamsted. She thanks them for their recent letter and hopes that her Aunt Sarah is recovering. She reports on a friend's birthday, in honor of which the "governess gave the girls a treat." She declares that she is happy at school but looks forward to reuniting with her family at midsummer. Harriet remarks that her chilblains are better but that "we have had little colds," and goes on to include Caroline in sending love to her parents, suggesting that she and Caroline were at school together. Harriet mentions, cryptically, that "I am requested by Governess to say that I have not had any port wine."</p>

                     <p>On the first page of this letter, Harriet writes to tell her brother Robert about a ship, a "large East India man [sic] came into Portsmouth yesterday." Knowing of Robert's interest in ships, she provides details on the vessel, which is called, "The Prince of Walse [sic]" and is "frigate built." She goes on to write to her father on the following pages of the letter. Mary, who seems to be staying with her mother and siblings, relays a message telling her father that "Mr. Waters...is to clean the chicken house..." along with select other chores. She reports that their piano has arrived and that they will not have to overhear the demolition of a local church, which will happen in six weeks' time. She says that a Mr. Wallis will pilot the "Prince of Wales" ship that she has mentioned to Robert. Harriet reports on Mary and George's sketching and asks her father to "send Macbeth for me" along with another book. She comments on the Wallises' plums before closing. Bradford Leslie pens a small note on the last page, asking his brother Robert to send "my schooner...and also a piece of wood to make her spars..."</p>

                     <p>Harriet reports calling upon a Miss Rogers and talking with her about an election. A Mr. Jones was not elected and Miss Rogers claims that "it was the Queen's doing." There is some concern about "the Jones[es] escap[ing] skin free &amp; spotless..." Harriet goes on to discuss further social calls and correspondence. She inquires about her brother Bradford's face (it seems to have been injured) and comments on other mutual acquaintances. Harriet worries about someone called Ann, who seems unable to save her money, and expresses her worry about Leslie's having "[given] a picture for her," the value of which, she feels, would have been better allocated to his own children, who have to "look at every farthing." She continues badgering her father about Ann's wasteful spending habits. She closes affectionately, but the letter seems to reveal considerable anxiety about the family's finances.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from Bromyard, Herefordshire, saying that she misses her family and fears being forgotten by "the little ones," but that a trip to the seaside (whence she writes) will "patch me quite up for the whole winter..." She inquires after the children at home (it seems that Robert is with her) and sends instructions for their care. She writes repetitively of coming home and sets a date for her return. Harriet comments on being in Malvern, saying that she went to the library and scanned the visitors' list but did not see a Miss Wilkie or Lady Laurie. Harriet closes but then adds an odd postscript about her dislike for widows who remarry and closes again with some instructions for their daughter, Harriet.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes a brief letter to her husband, reporting that Mr. and Mrs. Brown have just left, and that a Mr. Humphrey "has been all sufficient to Miss Bacon..." She reports further that "Mr. Brown says his Excellency the American Minister Mr. Stephenson &amp; his Lady are to pay a visit to the Castle..." Letter is addressed to Leslie first at the Castle Hotel in Windsor, but this is crossed out, along with an address to Leslie at the Royal Academy. Ultimately, the letter was sent to Leslie at home, at 12 Pine Apple Place in Edgware, London.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes while away from home, likely on a seaside holiday with the children. She begins with a little note recommending that Leslie not fold his letters "so wide apart." She says that she is glad to have been away while Irving was visiting Leslie, for she suspects that the former is "jealous" of her and would prefer Leslie to have remained a bachelor. She amends her remark by stating that she is sure Irving likes her as much as she likes him. Harriet comments on the children's sketching and swimming. She remarks that she is sorry that Leslie's picture "has been so much interrupted," but that she is glad that Irving was pleased with "the St. John's head" in this painting. Harriet closes with a postscript saying, "I dont think you read all my stuff--I forgive you--but burn these."</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from Sandgate, in Kent, dating her letter "October 23." She bemoans the wintery weather, but counters the gloomy account with a report of a "charming drive to Saltwood Castle in Mrs Foster's carriage..." She remarks that she is glad that Charles has found his spectacles and asks where they were. She tells her husband to relay a message to their daughter, Harriet, about the curtains for the house, saying that they must be suited to the Leslies' means and standing, or else will be vulgar. She gives further direction about cooking and remarks that "[a] beggar has just appeared in sailors clothes..." outside, shortly before closing the letter. She advises Charles to keep warm on the sofa.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes home to report various woes, among them poor weather and bad food. She remarks that a family called the Fosters are "just passed," having left Harriet and the children "strangers in a strange land." Mention of the Fosters in another letter addressed from Sandgate, Kent, suggests that this letter also comes from the same place and dates from the same time. Harriet acknowledges that she complains a lot, but notes that the place where she is staying is more expensive and of poorer quality than London. She reports on buying Bradford some rubber boots and asks for a piece of sewing work to be sent to her. She complains again about the rain and then requests her husband to call on a "Mr Gray" to tell him of her disappointment with a dress that he has made for her. She relays some orders for the servant, Susan, and asks Leslie not to send more potted meats. Letter is dated "Thursday" only.</p>

                     <p>Letter addressed to "CR Leslie Esq RA" at 71 Parrock Street, Gravesend. Postmark is partially obscured and the letter does not appear complete.  Harriet writes of someone going to America, saying that the person will undoubtedly gain experience he lacks by being robbed, for "a Thief, is about the first <emph render="italic">gentleman</emph> he shall meet [in] America." She says that she has written to Rose Baron, stating that when she writes the name she is reminded of Lord Byron's verse. Harriet asks Leslie to relay a message to Bradford and comments on domestic matters. She closes by commenting on her worry over George and someone called Polly, who are sailing. She adds a postscript directing Leslie to "Burn all this rubbish."</p>

                     <p>Letter is postmarked from Ryde, in the Isle of Wight. Harriet is concerned that Leslie is being made ill by his paint, and advises that Robert can take Bradford's bed from their room. She frets about Leslie's health, worrying about him being left alone. She asks for Robert to bring her "Machine as I have not quite recovered my sea sickness. I am so giddy &amp; assure you I <emph render="underline">have not drunk any</emph> beer, it is not good enough." She passes on a criticism of Susan, a servant, for forgetting an item in a parcel for Harriet. She bemoans George and Bradford's new friendship with an "idle" boy in town, asking Leslie to write them of his great expectations for them and to require them to write "an abridgment of each separate life as they read it..." She comments on some porcelain brush handles that Leslie seems to be ready to purchase, hopes that Susan will manage the apples on the tree at home, and also hopes that Leslie will enjoy an upcoming trip after remembering to "wrap up the old Plates" in advance of some home improvement to be done.</p>

                     <p>Letter is postmarked from Ryde, in the Isle of Wight. Harriet writes in a playful tone, teasing Leslie about getting "puffed up" on praise. She thanks him for sending some vermillion and is glad that he has killed a rat at their home. Harriet advises Leslie on some domestic issues with the servants, telling him how to handle Susan, who has her faults. She inquires about his progress with a painting, encouraging him to finish it. She asks him to write to their son Bradford and challenge him to a drawing or painting contest with his brother Robert. Harriet remarks on her health and closes with a request for a dresser or cabinet to be built with a closing door. She includes a tiny sketch of the furniture piece.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes to C.R. Leslie while away from home, probably on a seaside holiday with the children. She comments that she has written him recently and mentioned a house to let that has been taken in the meantime. She says that there "is not a lodging, or house to let in this place..." She mentions that "Mary and H. bathe every day..." and comments that someone called "Sam" left town for London, suffering with a stomach ache that only improved with a "table spoonful" of "Daffy's Elixir," a popular cure-all of the era. Harriet remarks that she has expressed her feelings on "the engraver, I hope you will hold up your head, till I return, &amp; then I will hold it up for you..." It seems that there is some kind of financial dispute afoot. Harriet also writes of the children's artistic education, hoping that Robert can attend drawing school in the evening and that Mary will get some much-needed "tuition." Harriet comments on having to alter dresses made recently by a local dressmaker, advising Leslie sharply not to mention the problem to the dressmaker but to have their daughter Caroline pay close attention to the fitting of her own dress. Harriet closes with a postscript asking for Caroline to send some cayenne pepper and hoping that she will eat oatmeal porridge for tea.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from St. Albans Bank, saying that it is lovely and that she wishes she could have Charles, George, Bradford, Robert, and Caroline with her. She mentions Robert's return trip and hopes that he has "got over his annoyance about the Cab..." She asks for Caroline to have the servants wash and press "my lilac flounced dress" and for Charles to bring it with him when he comes, "with the clogs india Rubber ones [sic]," and to send a note from Mary along to Annie Beale. She comments on her restful sleep and expresses her wish that Charles will join them if they stay in St. Albans Bank longer. She closes by saying the letter is written in great haste and adds a note on the outside page to request a sketch book be sent.</p>

                     <p>Harriet labels the date on the letter, "wet day," and  begins by bemoaning the wet weather. She advises Charles that she and the children will be home "on Monday," and sends various instructions for the servant, Amelia. She requests 20 pounds to pay the bills from the holiday and apologizes for the amount, however commenting that "it is all fair play." She sends love from Aunt Clark, whose eyes are better. Harriet closes with a list of expenses, one of which is "Breakage."</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes perhaps from the train, noting at the top of her letter that "The rail road is very long and tedious." She says that it is cool on this particular evening. She mentions a "Mrs. Beales &amp; Mrs. M. &amp; the babies" who have recently arrived and remarks on the strength of Mrs. M. She inquires about Harriet and George and hopes that "the girls will...look into the kitchen without appearing to seek for faults." She insists that Robert come down to stay with her, after Mrs. Beales has requested his presence. Harriet hesitates to have the girls join her in town, however, as they are "very particular." She worries about Mary's eye, which bothers her a great deal and seems infected. She closes on a more positive note, commenting on the pleasant weather and the moonlight on the water, which is "quite the color of your black &amp; gold fish."</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes about the date of her upcoming return home, saying that Leslie may either come up and join them for a night or that she can get the children home herself. She wishes, with underlining for emphasis, "to be with you alone at Hampton Court..." She goes on to discuss hiring a new maid and remarks that Miss Moore (a local acquaintance) has "read some of 'the Life,' presumably one of the autobiographical or biographical projects on which Leslie was working. Harriet closes with a fanciful discussion of the pleasures and possible excesses of living in the country.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes to follow up on her daughter Harriet's note to Charles. Harriet Jane Leslie requested money from her father, for the family, but Harriet Stone writes that they probably will not need as much as her daughter requested. She comments on the pleasant weather and remarks that Mary's drawings are very lifelike and impressive. She lists a few things that they have purchased, including parasols, flannel for petticoats, and boots, as a way of illustrating that they are not "extravagant." She sends love to a family member (perhaps the "Aunt C." whose train ticket to Brighton Harriet has purchased) and sends her love to "my Buck" and "dear Brad."</p>

She reports that Robert has arrived safely. She goes on to say that she will be happy "on Monday because I shall know you will be enjoying yourself..." with some mutual friends. She closes and then writes a second note to say that the sleeping arrangements are satisfactory and that Charles can join them comfortably.  She hopes that "Rebecca will come up" to visit Charles and asks him to make up his mind about staying at "Aberdeen Place" or else she will come home to him. She passes along instructions for Susan, the servant, and then reports on Robert, Bradford, and George going rambling and painting. She closes with a few domestic details.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes to report her safe arrival and that she has seen a Miss Julia Moore, who took her to the Moore home. She asks Charles to "give [her] love to the army at home" and comments on "the commander of the Theatre," who is perhaps one of the children. She closes with a cryptic postscript saying, "The little lady lived at Kingston."</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from Brighton. She acknowledges receipt of 15 pounds from Leslie, and reports on the improving health of Caroline. Harriet is content in Brighton, but misses her husband. She comments a bit on money matters and moves on to praise Bradford for being "such an excellent good fellow," saying that she will be sorry to part with him. She adds a postscript about George wanting another waistcoat and gives Leslie directions to a shop where he might find one for a certain price.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes while away from home, telling her husband that she noticed one of his pictures, "May Day," as being put up for sale along with other items belonging to a gentleman. Harriet comments on a Mrs. Dunlop, who left her goddaughter a considerable amount of money. She says that the day is lovely and she misses her loved ones, though she knows that Leslie is well "&amp; in fresh air." She laments feeling that she is "doing nothing for my Family at home." The letter continues past the extant pages.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from Brighton. She complains that Charles has been inattentive to her letters and reminds him that their daughter Caroline has a cold. She says that they are comfortable in their lodgings with a Mrs. Mays_ard. Harriet continues to comment on Caroline's cold, pledging to get her better. She asks Leslie about a card for/from a Mrs. Bates, and mentions that she has seen the Rogerses. Harriet frets about the state of things at home and advises Leslie to buy for himself, Bradford, and George, "some of the warm trousers all the fashion now..." She closes by stating, "I know of no sea like the Brighton Sea."</p>

                     <p>Harriet hopes that Charles has arrived safely, presumably back at home after dropping off the family on a holiday. She says that they have " a nice little bed for Brad" but goes on to complain that "our bedroom was so much infested last night with the smell..." Harriet remarks that the family felt lost without Leslie there, and that Bradford "was up this morning &amp; over the Downs," suggesting that this letter comes from Sussex. She frets about Bradford's health, suspecting something is wrong with him because "he breathes so hard at times &amp; seems tired without cause..." She closes with a note about a Miss Wadding who has returned with them and sends her love to Caroline.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes that she received Charles's last letter. She writes that she grieves "over Mrs. Knott," but says that the dead woman was such a good Christian that no one should be too upset because she is going to Heaven. She reports that Mr. Wallis has lent his punt, but that Robert enjoys nothing more than sketching. She believes that Robert should go "to Carey's school &amp; make him drudge well there for a year at least." She comments on the marriage of Mrs. Knott's niece, but says that "Alfred C. I am sure wonders any one should get married," as he feels that pretty girls are suited only for artist's models and that "children [are]...useless." She sends instructions for the servant, Susan, and asks Charles to bring Caroline's boots when he arrives in town.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes, complaining about the scant postal service. She hopes that Charles is well and remarks on the pleasant weather. She writes about looking for a house to rent while she and the children are away. She comments on the price of a copyright (she says it should be 50 pounds), possibly referring to a matter with an engraver that is mentioned in another letter. She sends a playful remonstrance to Caroline and asks Charles to kiss "the dear Buck," likely referring to one of their sons, but to tell him that "he must be industrious." Harriet mentions an Uncle Sam and his wife, with whom they are staying. She calls Uncle Sam's wife "a regular Irish rogue."</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes, in typical fashion, expressing worries about home while away. She asks Leslie and their son Robert to write and tell her more about what is going on at home. She notes that Caroline has told her of a "little sweeper girl" who "rings the bell very often," and asks Leslie to have a servant, Amelia, warn the girl and then report her to the police. She hopes that George's Sunday clothes will be readied for church and closes, perhaps unintentionally comically, "your lovely wife, Harriet Leslie." A postscript reports that a Mrs. Stone is going to visit a Mr. Armstrong and is very proud of the fact; although Harriet has already had a call from him, she has not informed Mrs. Stone.</p>

(perhaps the Mrs. Beale referred to in other letters from the seaside) wished her and the children to stay but that Mary's eye continues to trouble her and she does not want to be away from home.  She closes with information about her travel plans for returning home, telling Charles that she will be on a train passing through Brighton and arriving "in town at 5.30 that is 1/2 past 5 o'cl in town."</p>

                     <p>Harriet acknowledges receipt of Leslie's recent letter and "the Punch with your Sir Roger in it..." referring to a print of his painting, "Sir Roger De Coverley Going to Church." She comments on the sermon preached at church earlier in the day. She remarks that "none but a man impressed with the transitoryness [sic] of this life could have preach [sic] such a sermon..." Rather humorously, she notes that, given the potentially fatal heart complaint she knows the preacher to have, "all Parsons ought to have heart complaints" that they might preach as effectively. She closes with affectionate messages for their sons, "dear Buck and Rob," and a couple of other comments.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from "Standwell House, Rottingdean." She expresses dismay not to have had a letter from Charles, and hopes that he is well. She asks for George to bring senna leaves from home and reports on Harriet, Caroline, and Mary all bathing earlier in the day, saying that she wishes she had the courage to do it too. She has watched a storm all night, wondering whether Charles experienced it too. She admonishes Charles again for not writing and states that she is anxious about him and wishes she hadn't left him. She is pleased with the food and wishes she could share it with Charles. She warns him not to stay in Robert's room because it is too cold and damp, again wishing that Charles were with her to experience the warm and pleasant weather. Bradford has befriended a local couple called the Coppers, and will "paint them another picture." Harriet requests a board for him, "like Mary's" and follows with a list of tasks for the servant Susan to perform.</p>

                     <p>A portion of a longer letter to Charles, which appears to have been torn or separated as a loose page, from the rest of the letter. The fragment begins mid-sentence, with Harriet writing about a handsome woman, who with her spouse, has paid a visit to Cholmleys. She writes of her longing to see Charles and then advises him that their daughter, Harriet, "need not mention our friends here to little Buck." She also advises Charles not to pay for Rebecca's train fare.</p>

                     <p>An apparent fragment of a letter, in which Harriet writes about a Miss Doyle, of whom she approves "for the Girls." She writes that "Captain gives a sorry account of the Major Leslie, I mean the Mrs..." and goes on to quote a woman complaining about the inferiority of London. Perhaps she refers to C.R. Leslie's brother, Capt. Thomas Jefferson Leslie, who had had a distinguished career with the U.S. Army.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes from 2 Abercorn Place, St. John's Wood. She pens a brief note about items forgotten, including a sketchbook and drawing materials. She says that she will send the package of things (presumably to Charles) if "Thomas says it is of consequence enough." She sends her love to the friends with whom Charles is staying. The letter is addressed to Charles at the home of Edmund Beale, 42 Rue de Constantine, Boulougne.</p>

                     <p>Harriet writes to Charles in Paris, having sent a previous letter that was misdirected. She comments on wanting "to get Caroline away," most likely to school, soon, and asks Charles not to leave "M. with the Beales unless she can have a room to herself." Perhaps she refers to their daughter Mary. Harriet goes on to express her dislike and distrust of someone (the line is partially crossed out) and says that "she keeps you in hot water &amp; wants angels to bear all her tartness..." She sends love to Mary and asks Charles to advise her not to spend a lot of money on a bonnet but to buy indoor shoes instead. The letter ends with Harriet's comment that "all we want is for you to take care of yourself." It is not clear whether this was the closing of the letter, but there are no other pages.  The letter is addressed to Leslie at the Hotel Wagnam, Rue de Rivoli, Paris.</p>

                     <p>Letter is addressed to Leslie at the Hotel des Tuileries in Paris. Harriet reports that a Mr. and Mrs. Redgrave have just arrived and told her that someone (perhaps their son) was married and had just arrived from Paris with his new wife, "a Miss Wright." She jokes, cryptically, that it's "better late [than never]." Harriet comments that Caroline's health is improving and that she misses her husband, who seems to be traveling with their daughter, Mary. Harriet issues various instructions, including some on Leslie's washing (she suggests that he not wash too much) and that he have Polly, a servant, look after him. She tells him strongly not to go to Beales again, and writes that Bradford can come to get Mary at Folkestone. Harriet bemoans the fact that "taste is flown the land" as "Hazlewood has yellowed all the windows in the Church, all mustard, a November fog." She tells Charles to pack up his own things and to have Mary remember to take her best things and look after her father's belongings.</p>

                     <p>Mary Leslie writes to her father to tell him that she has had "three dips in the sea" and adds a few other details about an apparent seaside trip. She includes a small sketch at the top of the letter, saying "I drew the little chur[ch] this morning..." The tone and handwriting of this letter suggest that it was written when Mary was still quite young.</p>

                     <p>In this undated letter, Mary writes to her mother while on a visit, perhaps to relatives. She includes a graphite sketch of a mother with two children, indicating that they are part of the Mason family. She says that the last time she was "here," the eldest child was the "little boy I drew" but has now grown big. She reports that "we are enjoying ourselves very much..." She discusses a hunting excursion on donkeys, and asks her mother not to worry about sending her paint box to her, as it is "too late in the year to sketch out of doors." Mary writes that a neighbor, Mrs. Allen, gave them some jam and loaned them books, of which Felicia Heman's poetry was meant for her. Mary's tone and handwriting suggest that she was a young teenager at the time of this letter.</p>

                     <p>Mary writes while visiting Bradford in Chepstow, Wales. She reports that "Braddy" has taken her to "Beachley, where there is a long pier reaching out into the river..." She says that there is to be a flower show at "the castle" in the next week, and anticipates a visit to the show, when Bradford will "have a holyday." She writes of drawing flowers, amply supplied by "the Miss Phillips," and of sketching "Miss Kinbys garden." Mary writes of an odd parlor trick or prank played by a lady in the area who drew a baby's face on her hand and convinced a child that it was "a dead baby, and when the little girl took it, and found it moved, she was quite frightened and ran away, but when she found it was only a hand, she wanted to make one...and went upstairs to frighten the nurse." Mary illustrates the letter with a charming watercolor vignette of a red squirrel by the side of a pond, saying that she and Bradford saw a similar scene on their way home.</p>

                     <p>Mary writes a short note to thank her father for money that he sent, saying that it was lucky that he addressed it to her and not to Bradford, as he was "at the bridge" and unavailable. As part of a five year apprenticeship to Isambard Brunel, Bradford was working, in 1851 and 1852, an assistant engineer at Chepstow Bridge; it is likely that the mention of him being at the bridge refers to this post. She includes a sketch of "the Castle as it appeared yesterday from Tutshill during the Flower Show." She is glad to hear that C.R. Leslie and his wife are thinking of coming to visit Mary and Bradford and reports that despite the pouring rain, she is still not ready to come home yet.</p>

                     <p>Mary writes to her mother, sending the letter with Bradford as he heads home for a visit. Mary reports on a recent event (perhaps the opening) at the Chepstow Bridge, saying that it "looked beautiful all decorated with flags, I was just in time to see the first engine driven across..." She asks her mother to send along a "blue band," part of a dress that she has received from home, but whose "defect" can only be concealed with the missing band. She comments on the pleasant "bauuing" of the sheep and lambs outside her window at night. She includes an unfinished watercolor of a verdant riverbank with a bridge across it.</p>

                     <p>Mary writes while on a visit to her brother, Bradford, who was at this time working as an engineer on a bridge in Chepstow, Wales. She reports that Bradford has taken her to Wyndcliff. She describes the beautiful view and includes a small watercolor illustration to show the rainbow that appeared after "a heavy storm" from which she and Bradford were forced to seek shelter while sketching. She writes of observing the robins in the area. She expresses sympathy about her mother's toothache (about which she has heard from her sister, Caroline) and about an unsuccessful party that her parents have had. She requests "some small good oil colour paint brushes," and illustrates the five brushes in pen and ink.</p>

                     <p>Mary writes to her mother, relaying a "funny story" that she says is related to one that her sister Caroline has included in a recent letter to Bradford. The story concerns a little girl who had her pet sparrows baked into a pudding for her birthday. The rather macabre tale, Mary reflects, is "not such a funny one as Caroline's, but it sounded much better than I can write it." Mary writes about her drawing habits of late, copying faces out of books by Chalon and Lewis. She reports on a fair in Chepstow, which she is missing because of the rain. She also writes of visiting the grounds of the estate of the Phillipses, a local family. She includes two pen and ink vignettes--one of birds decorating a vase of flowers with string and a sketch of the fair.</p>

                     <p>A watercolor illustration remains on this fragment of a letter from Mary Leslie to her mother. The illustration shows a man dressed in a sort of 17th century military costume sitting high in a tree. The letter has been cut down so that only the fragment with the illustration remains. The handwriting that is visible and the style of letter seems similar to those found in Mary's letters home from Chepstow, in 1851-2.</p>

                     <p>Robert Charles writes to his father from New York, commenting excitedly on his location and its proximity to water. He appears to have been staying at West Point, with his uncle and aunt. Robert writes of boarding the "Hendrick Hudson" and watching ships in the area. Robert is pleased with West Point and remarks that faculty members recall him from the family's earlier stay at West Point in 1833. Robert tells his father that today "went to see all the principle New York Artists viz Mr. West, Mr. Huntington &amp; Mr. Darand, very cilvil [sic] all of them." Robert remarks that he will be home soon and closes with a commentary on the constant local noise of "fire engines...of night bells tolling men shouting &amp; engines running...[I]t seems to me they have a great many fires..."</p>

                     <p>Robert writes to his father, commenting on the warm and pleasant weather. He discusses going out to make sketches, acknowledging that a sketching case (that his parents presumably gave him) works well but requesting "a little vermillion in a letter." Robert remarks that "Mr. Wallis has offered to let us have the small boat belonging to his cutter whenever we want a boat inside the harbour." He sends his brother George's love to the family.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes to chide Leslie for not having conveyed his news about the birth of his child (likely Robert, born in 1826) to Powell. He notes, humorously, that Leslie had asked him not to come back to his home until after the baby was born, but that Leslie has forgotten to tell Powell of the birth, despite having given other friends the news. Powell sends his congratulations and adds a postscript about seeing Constable the previous day.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes from Rue de Grenelle, Paris, to Leslie at Lisson Grove, Paddington. Powell apologizes for being so bad about correspondence, blaming his own procrastination for this problem as well as for his failure to marry. He acknowledges Leslie's relatively recent marriage and the birth of his son Robert. Powell remarks that his trip to Italy is postponed and he will be staying in Paris for the spring. He comments on the death of the artist John Flaxman (1755-1826), and discusses affairs of the Royal Academy, among them being whether the Academy will elect Constable to be "the new member in the room of Flaxman," saying that if Constable is not elected, the Academy can "go to the Devil..." He goes on to note that it seems Newton "is getting on very well with his Picture from Gil Blas," but that he does not know what Leslie's latest project is. He closes with a wish that he and Leslie were more alike, and asks about mutual acquaintances and domestic news.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes from Padua to Leslie at Lisson Grove, Paddington. Powell writes in his usual jovial tone, discussing the pleasures of Italy and its comfortable climate. He imagines that Leslie has heard about him through "John Chalon who I met at Geneva and with whom I afterwards visited the Valley of Chamonix &amp; the celebrated Mont Blanc." Powell goes on discussing various people whom he has met in cities around Italy. He notes that he has heard about the Royal Academy Exhibition, saying that Leslie has won "poor Collins's generous heart for ever I understand." He describes traveling in Italy with the Callcotts and meeting a painter called Mr. Lewis. He also describes a chapel painted by Giotto, in good condition thanks, in part, to being preserved from destruction by Napoleon. He urges Leslie to see the chapel. Powell closes by mentioning several mutual friends, among them Newton, the Condeys [?], and Constable.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes from No. 68 Via Sistina, Rome, to Leslie at Portman Place, Edgware Road, London. Powell writes romantically of his difficulty in leaving Rome, discussing its staggering history. He compares the relative freedom of Rome's citizens to the oppressions of English life, with its "noise &amp; newspapers &amp; cant about liberty..." He writes that, in his two years in Rome, there has only been one execution and "that for murder!" He goes on to talk about a mutual acquaintance who is traveling for his health, and notes having seen a print of "your Duke and Duchess," a work by Leslie, in a periodical. Powell concludes buoyantly with remarks about never wanting to return to England, despite the failure of some of his friendships because of his long time away.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes from Clapham Rise and addresses the letter to Leslie at Pine Apple Place, Edgware Road, London. He reports on his recent "Ramble through Belgium" and is sorry to have missed an invitation from Leslie to dine with him. He offers to attend another dinner to make "the best amends." He wants to see how Leslie is coming along with his "Coronation Picture, having met with two of your Lady Sitters at Tunbridge Wells last week." Peter closes with a rather cryptic postscript about a decision being made about a Jane Gamble. He is concerned about her leaving her home (?), saying that her parents will never recover from it.</p>

                     <p>Powell writes from Edinburgh, apologizing for his lack of correspondence. He notes that he never expected to stay in Edinburgh past the previous October, but reports that he has been staying with some "Batchelor Friends" who are also artists, and could not leave the lovely setting in which he stayed. This setting featured a castle, "river, hills, lake," etc., and "afforded a delightful ramble..." He writes, rather humorously, of narrowly avoiding marriage to a local woman and of hosting a church service in the Hall where he is staying.  He writes Leslie that "your Picture has been exhibiting here with great eclat, &amp; prints to the amount of three hundred Pounds subscribed for in...two days." He writes of meeting a Mr. Allan, R.A., and plans on returning to England within the month.</p>
