         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>The Pease family are remarkable as an example of a nineteenth century success story—success that sprung largely from their pivotal role in the development of English railroads over the course of the century. In the Victorian era, they became well established and rose to prosperity and prominence, taking part in politics and enjoying a rather lavish lifestyle. What makes the Pease family even more unique is that they were Quakers. This aspect of their identity affected their business decisions, their marriages, and their lifestyles as their fortunes rose, and the Peases' changing relationship with their faith is described in many histories and memoirs about them. The Victorian era was the peak in the Peases' fortune; the last years of the 19th century, as well as the beginning of the 20th, brought change and financial trouble.</p>
         <p>Edward Pease, born in 1767, was to become known as "the father of the English Railways" for his role in founding the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. The S&amp;D Railway, used primarily for the transportation of industrial cargo between various towns along the Tees river, was the first English steam railway. Edward's diaries, published by Alfred Edward Pease in 1907, offer an extensive personal and social history of the early to mid-nineteenth century. Some of the Pease diaries and other personal writings have been published, while others remain in the family, or are kept in local record offices in Durham County. The YCBA collection of Pease family material concerns the descendants of Edward Pease, including his son, Henry Pease (1807-1881), and his granddaughters, Emma and Jane Pease (who were the daughters of Joseph Pease, the first Quaker M.P.). The collection also contains material pertaining to  the family of Edward's grandson, Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, the first Quaker Baronet, and his great-great grandson, Christopher York Pease, who was killed in the First World War.</p>
         <p>Members of the family whose items appear in the YCBA archive:</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">"E. Gurney"= Emma Gurney (ca. 1800-1860)</emph>: Wife of Joseph Pease. Daughter of Joseph Gurney, and member of a notable Quaker family in Northeastern England. Married Joseph Pease in 1826, uniting Gurney family fortune with the Pease name, thereby bringing the Peases into prominence in the area. Mother to five sons and four daughters: Jane, Joseph Whitwell, Emma, Rachel, Elizabeth, Edward, John Henry, Arthur, Francis Richard, Gurney (father to Katherine Pease Routledge, who later voyaged to Easter Island), Alfred, and Charles Pease. Joseph and Emma lived at Southend, an estate in Darlington that, while less ostentatious than the eventual homes of their sons, was still grand. The estate included a "long carriage drive lined with thick trees" (Van Tilburg, 13). Southend was the Pease family seat during the mid-nineteenth century years of success and rising fortunes.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Emma Gurney Pease (ca. 1830-d. 1895)</emph>: Daughter of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). Avid watercolorist and artist.  In 1851, she toured the European continent with her family, a trip that inspired many drawings and watercolors. In 1853, she traveled to Scotland . She again traveled to Europe in 1874. She never married, and lived at Southend, the Darlington home of Joseph Pease. Described by Jo Anne Van Tilburg in <title>
               Among Stone Giants
            </title> in later life as:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>Slender, with lovely skin, big eyes, and chiseled features. Bright and empathetic…she was efficient and practical with a quick, impatient manner that many people thought was pushy and sharp. Emma had no close friends but took an intellectual interest in women's issues and Quaker philanthropy, using her fortune to support schools and health and to employ her formidable administrative talents. Emma thought clearly, read widely, wrote well, and had a keen sense of humor. She kept voluminous personal journals but left strict instructions for them to be burned after her death…Emma was devout, but her faith had a strong rational component.	(Van Tilberg, 14).</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Emma supported her niece Katherine in her passionate desire to go to college, when Katherine faced approbation and shock from her more immediate family members. She died on 2 July 1895, and was buried with her sister Jane.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Elizabeth Lucy Pease (1833-1881)</emph>: Fourth and youngest daughter of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). She married John Fowler (1826-1864), agricultural engineer, on 30 July 1857, in a sober and quiet Quaker ceremony, unlike the wedding of her sister Rachel in 1851. John's brother William was the second husband of Rachel Pease. After having designed and manufactured an innovative steam plough during the late 1850s and early 1860s, John Fowler founded a new steam plough manufacturing business in Leeds, "John Fowler and Co.," in 1863. William eventually loaned money to the struggling J. &amp; J.W. Pease Bank in 1897. Elizabeth enjoyed a comfortable life during the apex of the Pease family fortunes in the 19th century. John Fowler died of tetanus after a fall from his horse in 1864.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Jane Gurney Pease (1827-1894)</emph>: Daughter of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). In 1851, she toured the European continent with her family, a trip that inspired many sketches and watercolors. Jane was considered eccentric and a spiritual visionary. According to Jo Anne Van Tilburg, family history had it that Jane had fallen in love while staying with her family at the Pease summer home, Cliffe House, in Marske-by-the-Sea. Jane's beau was supposed to become the Church of England's archdeacon of Cleveland, and her father, Joseph, refused to allow her to marry a non-Quaker (the prohibition against marrying outside of the Quaker faith would not be relaxed until the mid-nineteenth century). Jane submitted to her father's judgment and ultimately never married. Like her sister Emma, she lived at Southend, in Darlington. Described by Jo Anne Van Tilburg in later life, Jane:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>[preferred] seclusion and illusion. She spent her withdrawn days lying on a sofa, eating massive plates of teacakes and jam rolls and filling vast numbers of pages in her many journals with flowing script. She was preoccupied with food, filling a great emptiness inside with elaborate meals and teas prepared from heirloom Quaker recipes. Though she glided through the house with the appearance of a duchess, Jane had the heavy "Pease physique" and lethargic temperament later attributed to [her niece] Katherine. Jane had an aristocratic nose, a prominent beauty spot, a dreamy smile, and a ready laugh. She sought the companionship of young male "protégées" and charmed and flattered them shamelessly…[Jane] was a romantic who 'saw the world through a veil of poetry.' Jane had a rich repertoire of humorous and moralistic tales but also knew by heart the North Country's terrifying ghost stories…Intensely bored by the limitations of her life choices, Jane's brilliant mind turned inward. Her spiritual life grew increasingly rich and charismatic, and she blossomed from a storyteller into a remarkably gifted public speaker and Quaker visionary…As Aunt Jane grew older and her circle of visitors grew smaller, she led her life at Southend in a world of insular shadows that grew increasingly deeper and darker. She believed she could commune with the dead, especially Joseph Pease and her brothers…She saw their spirits walking on the paths and terraces of Southend, or sometimes lying snug in their graves and, she said, heard their voices. The family ghosts Jane conjured were constantly moving about, day and night, haunting Southend and deeply disturbing Emma.		(Van Tilburg, 14-15)</p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>Along with her sister Emma, Jane was a source of love, support, and stability for her nephews and nieces, among them Katherine Pease Routledge. Jane died on April 5, 1894 in Torquay. Her funeral was held in Darlington, with her coffin covered in flowers and plant sprigs from Southend. She was buried at the Quaker burial ground in Darlington.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Rachel Pease (1831-1912)</emph>: Third daughter of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). She Married Charles Albert Leatham of Wakefield in 1851, with great festivities accompanying the event. "There was…bell-ringing,…[a] brass band…flags were flown on the stations of the Stockton and Darlington railway, and…there were salvoes of artillery. The bride was attended to the meeting house by seven bridesmaids," (Orde, 102). Leatham had established an engine works and iron foundry in Middlesbrough, along with Edgar Gilkes and Isaac Wilson, in 1843.  Charles and Rachel had five daughters:  Rachel Mary Leatham (b. 1852, m. 1874), Emma (b. 1853, m. 1875), Margaret (b. 1855, m. 1875), Elizabeth (b. 1856, m. 1880 to Leonard Pelly, d. 1930) and Jane (b. 1857, m. 1878), and apparently a son who died in infancy ("Male Leatham" in birth records from Darlington, 1858). 1851 census records show Charles and Rachel living at Southend, the estate of Rachel's father Joseph, but later records made after Charles's death show Rachel and her family, along with servants, a governess, nursemaid, and cook, living in their own household. Charles died in 1858 and Rachel later married William Fowler (1828-1905), her brother-in-law by her sister Elizabeth's marriage, in 1875. William was one of five sons of John Fowler, a dedicated member of the Religious Society of Friends. According to the <title>
               DNB
            </title>, he rose to prominence as a politician and financier after a period of economic lows during the 1860s. William and two of his brothers took over John Fowler's steam plough business after John's death in 1864. Rachel Pease was William's third wife. Census records show them living in London in 1901. They had no children together, although William had eight children from his first marriage to Rachel Howard.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Henry Pease (4 May 1807-1881)</emph>: Fifth son of Edward Pease and Rachel Whitwell. Henry married Anna Fell on 25 February, 1835, with whom he fathered a son, Henry Fell Pease (1838-96). Anna died in 1839. Henry then married Mary Lloyd on 19 January 1859, and had three daughters and two sons with her (including Edward Lloyd Pease). In 1845, he purchased "Pierremont" house in Darlington, a showy, Gothic mansion, which he enlarged in 1873, with vast gardens and land. Henry served as a Quaker elder for many years. He gave up Quaker dress, but used plain speech until the 1860s. He refused to allow a piano in his home until old age, and never approved of dancing. He went to Russia in January 1854 as part of a failed Peace Society effort to persuade Emperor Nicholas against entering what would become the Crimean War. He served as MP for South Darlington from 1857 to 1865. In 1867, he visited Napoleon III as part of a Peace Society mission, but the society's request to hold a peace congress during the international exhibition in Paris was denied. Henry was primarily involved in the Darlington branch of the NE Railways, working as a promoter. He opened a railway line across Stainmoor in 1861, considered "the backbone of England." Henry died 30 May 1881, during a London meeting of the Religious Society of Friends.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Edward Lloyd Pease (1861-1934)</emph>: Son of Henry Pease. He was educated at Cambridge, where he was a strong athlete (primarily in rowing). Edward traveled around the world, visiting America, Australia, and Europe, before settling down to a business career in Durham County. An avid hunter, he became director of several family business concerns in the Durham area. In 1890 he married Helen Blanche Pease, with whom he had a daughter, Mary Cecelia Pease (1892-1975).</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">John Henry Pease (1836-1854)</emph>: Son of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). He appeared in the 1851 census, visiting Barclays' household in Essex with his family. He died at age of 18.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Mary W. Pease (d. 1892)</emph>: Married Joseph Whitwell Pease. A talented watercolorist, she made an important record of the family estate, Hutton Hall, in Guisborough, in her "Hutton Hall" album.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Sarah Charlotte Pease. (1858-1929)</emph>: Second daughter of Joseph Whitwell Pease and his wife Mary Fox. In 1897, she married Howard Hodgkin, the relative of a banking partner of the Pease family, Thomas Hodgkin.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Francis Richard Pease (1844-1865?)</emph>: Son of Joseph and Emma Pease (nee Gurney). There is a death record for a "Francis Richard Pease" in Middlesex County in 1865.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Helen Blanche Pease (1865-1951)</emph>: Daughter of Joseph Whitwell and Mary Pease (nee Fox). She was a cousin to Beatrice Pease (of the "Portsmouth affair" family scandal), who was raised by Helen's mother and father after the death of her own parents. She was cousin also to Katherine Pease Routledge, who would travel to Easter Island in the 1910s. Sister to Alfred Edward Pease. On 15 January 1890, she married her somewhat distant cousin, Edward Lloyd Pease. During her lifetime, she served as Justice of the Peace for Durham County.</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Mary Cecelia Pease (1892-1975)</emph>: Daughter of Helen Blanche Pease. Married Reginald J. Mounsey (1884-) in 1921. Reginald appears to have served in WWI, as part of the Durham Light Infantry. Listed in WWI Medal Rolls Index 1914-1920.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection comprises sketchbooks, watercolors, and school exercise books. It documents the period of the Pease family's greatest fortunes in the 19th century. The collection sheds light on the changing customs of the family, as they rose to prominence in industry and politics. The exercise books record different practices and standards of education for boys and girls during this time. The drawings and sketchbooks document the Pease's financial prosperity, which allowed them to travel widely and live in grand homes in multiple locations. Items in the collection were mostly created by children and women of various generations. The material documents aspects of women's leisure life in the 19th century, especially their amateur artistic practice.</p>

                     <p>Inscribed "E. Gurney" in graphite on the cover. Contains graphite sketches of scenes from a trip that Emma took with her family to Dieppe, France, in 1814. From images of the voyage across the Channel, Emma moves on to make several sketches of local scenery, residents going about their daily tasks, and regional costume. Most of the pieces are not completed, but a few are more finished than others. Some of the drawings are part of an additional smaller sketchbook, here bound in. Towards the end of the sketchbook is an apparently transcribed (rather than originally composed) verse or song, in French. While Emma's transcription has some typical learner's grammatical mistakes, the gist of the verse is clear. It seems to be a dialog between a man and a woman, torn between the potential costs and glory of the battlefield and a relationship at home. With the contemporary situation of the Napoleonic Wars, this verse must have had particular relevance and poignancy at the time of Emma's visit to France.</p>

                     <p>Inscribed, "Emma Gurney Pease--from her dear Grandmamma Gurney, 1840." Contains  graphite sketches of rural scenery and botanical studies in watercolor. The works are generally accomplished, with detailed graphite drawings and carefully painted watercolors. Emma's work seems to show a stronger aptitude in, or even preference for, graphite pieces. The scenes depicted in the sketches include images of rural cottages, architectural ruins, and studies of tree leaf patterns. Many of the images in this book are mirrored in Jane Pease's sketchbook of the same era (Box 2, Folder 9), with nearly identical pieces occurring quite often.</p>

                     <p>Contains graphite sketches done mostly during family visits to Balder Grange, the home of Emma's aunt and uncle, and other local places. The sketches are labeled in what seems an adult's hand, in purple pencil. They are not fully finished, in most cases. In addition to the sketches, there are a couple of poems written in pen and black ink in a mature hand. The verse is about moral topics, but includes a rather odd poetic dialog between a sailor and a landlord, contrasting the lures of alcohol and money.</p>

                     <p>Contains graphite and watercolor seascapes and landscapes, with scenes of Scottish towns and lakes. The sketches vary in degree of completeness. There are views of Marske-by-the-Sea, where the Joseph Pease family had a holiday residence called Cliffe House.  One sketch, labeled "Meeting House, Easington," is not signed and, based on slight differences in style and in handwriting, seems possibly to have been made by a different artist. Other locations depicted include: St. Andrew's Church in Upleatham, Stirling (?) Castle, Loch Lomond, Loch Achray &amp; Benvenue from Trossachs Inn, and Mulgrave Hermitage.</p>

                     <p>Emma Gurney Pease made sketches over a number of years using this book. Because the design was such that individual pages could be removed, most of the sketches sit loose inside the covers. Most sketches are in graphite alone. Some are in graphite with the addition of sepia or indigo wash and gouache. There are a few pieces in full color watercolors. Many items appear fully finished, while some of the others have shading/coloration notes that indicate that Emma intended to come back and apply watercolor or make a more finished version. The sketches are of varying subjects, but most were done on family trips to some of the Peases' favorite destinations--the Alps and Scotland among them. There are few, if any, people in Emma's drawings here. Most items are drawn with a gaze directed outward and away from the self and family members.</p>

Lloyd," presumably a friend of Emma's. As is typical for Emma, the subject matter is that of scenes from nature or views of villages and architectural features from a distance. The sketches are mostly very complete and include a panoramic waterfront view done over two facing pages. Locations depicted include: Stirling, the Falls of Bruar, Loch Tummel, Tummel Bridge, Loch Goil (?), Fort Augustus, Iona, the Treshnish Isles (and the "Bac Mor," or "Dutchman's Cap" rock formation), Oban, Tay nuit (Muckcairn?), and Ellswater(?).</p>

                     <p>Consists of two graphite drawings by Helen Blanche Pease within the following published work: Hulme, F. Edward. <title>
                           Flower Painting in Water Colours
                        </title>. London: Cassell &amp; Co., [1881?]. The front endleaf is inscribed: Helen Blanche Pease, 1 Jany. 1882. Hulme authored several series of this title, circa 1880-1885. The present volume appears to be the first series. The title pages and other preliminaries have been neatly excised in this copy. It retains all 20 chromolithographed plates of common flowers. Helen appears to have taken minimal interest in the volume; she has copied in graphite but two specimens (the crocus and the Eschscholzia) on blank leaves facing the illustrated plates.</p>

                     <p>Contains graphite and watercolor drawings from a family trip to Switzerland in 1851 and a second trip to Cornwall in 1852. As is typical of Jane's work, the sketches are all landscapes of one kind or another, showing mountains, lakes, notable architectural features like Chillon Castle in Switzerland, and scenes from villages. In addition to the drawings made in Switzerland, the pieces from the trip to Cornwall consist of seascapes and landscapes. In particular, Jane includes a sketch of Cotham Lawn estate, which belonged to Margaret and Richard Fry. The Fry family was related to the Peases through marriage by this time. Other places depicted include: Lago di Como, Lago Maggiore, Montreux, Fribourg, Thun, Vevey, Heidelberg Castle, Giessbach Fall, Mainfort—Cornwall, Mount's Bay from Penzance, and Falmouth harbor.</p>

Many of the watercolors have tiny holes in them, suggesting they may have been pinned up somewhere (Mary's schoolroom at home perhaps?) or perhaps simply from being pinned to a drawing board/easel. The artworks are generally quite complete, with many studies included in the portfolio. On a few pieces, comments and what appear to be "scores" are given by an unidentified individual with the initials "L.W."</p>

                     <p>Contains drawings and watercolors by Lady Mary W. Pease, many concerning the family's Hutton Hall estate. The watercolors are done in a confident, accomplished hand. She seems to have had a particular talent for observation, composition, color, and in the handling of her paints. The works represent a close knowledge of the family home, record the style of décor that the Peases used, document family outings close by and further away (especially to Scotland), and show two other Pease properties. It includes still lifes of domestic items like cooking pots and utensils, botanical studies, and designs for wallpaper patterns. This album demonstrates Lady Mary's interest in her home and the way in which the home itself was a sort of canvas on which she expressed herself, as a prosperous Victorian wife.</p>
                     <p>Hutton Hall was designed for Joseph Whitwell Pease in 1868 by architect Alfred Waterhouse, who is perhaps best known for his work in designing the Natural History Museum in London. Waterhouse was raised in a Quaker family and received many commissions to design homes for prominent Quaker families in the North of England. Some of his very trademark elements are the terra cotta and cream colored brick construction, and the Gothic stylizing that can be seen in Hutton Hall. Hutton Hall had its own railroad station on a line that ran from Middlesborough to Guisborough, an extension of the original Stockton and Darlington Railway, established to carry more of the mineral freight from mines to ports in the area. Both of these towns were significantly developed by the Pease industrial enterprises.</p>
                     <p>It is not clear whether Lady Mary assembled this album herself or whether it was put together by another family member. Someone labeled these pieces in the twentieth century, long after her death, and it's possible that the physical album dates from the Victorian era. So, in a way, the idea of the "Hutton Hall Album" as a cohesive unit may not have been Lady Mary's exactly, although the number of paintings that are in it and their subject matter certainly shows us that the years, places, experiences depicted in the album are all sort of unified by the Hall, and by the period of time that the Peases occupied this house.</p>

                     <p>Contains works signed "S.C.P.", the initials of Sarah Charlotte Pease. The botanical studies are done in watercolor throughout. Flowers depicted include roses, coneflowers, bush honeysuckle, Capsicum, lilies, poppies, and Buddleia. Several of the pieces are labeled "Ben Welldene," which was the home of the Hodgkin family, into which Sarah eventually married. Benwell Dene was designed by Alfred Waterhouse for Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, who later donated the house to the Royal Victoria School for the Blind. Other pieces were painted in Scotland, Germany, and at the Pease family home, Hutton Hall.</p>

                     <p>Contains academic examination papers for Edward Lloyd Pease, the son of Henry Pease. Dating from 1869-1872, when Edward was between the ages of eight and eleven, the items evidence evaluation in composition, history, religion, and mathematics. All writing is done in pen and black ink, although an instructor (an Algernon C.P. Coote) has made comments in purple ink in the 1872 test booklet. The instructor notes particularly that Edward should not "write about things…not in the question." The examination papers indicate that they were likely administered at Pierremont, Henry Pease's estate in Darlington. An 1874 roster for Oliver's Mount School in Scarborough, which includes Edward, shows that after these examinations, he advanced to the boarding school.</p>

                     <p>Contains notes on zoology, geology, arithmetic, and engineering, by Edward Lloyd Pease, who was about fifteen years old at the time of the lessons recorded in it. Some of Edward's essays include illustrations of mechanical objects. Writing is in graphite or pen and black ink. It is possible that this schoolbook was used while Edward was at Oliver's Mount School, where he is listed on an 1874 roster. However, no instructor comments appear. A rather fanciful and spirited inscription by Edward  appears on front pastedown: "Elementary Science/ comprising a treatise on Astronomy/Natural Philosophy/ Geology &amp;/ Mensuration Formulae/ An abridgment [sic] from ther [sic] larger works on these subjects, which have been carefuly [sic] consulted by Mr. Robinson, and drawn up in such a manner that it is likely to prove the greater boon to students interested in these subjects published by/ E.L.

                     <p>Title page is inscribed "Emma Pease, Darlington, 1839" in an elaborate calligraphic hand. Exercises are written in pen and black ink throughout. It contains dozens of mathematical exercises, primarily in practical topics, such as "Addition of Money, Weights, and Measures," "Ale or Beer Measure," "Land Measure." The practical problems may have been meant to give a child a more concrete grasp of the application of mathematics, or perhaps they were meant to prepare a young female student for future management of a household.</p>

                     <p>Inscribed "Emma Gurney Pease Darlington, 3rd Mo. 8th 1841." It continues the practical or topical mathematical exercises of her 1839 schoolbook. All writing is in pen and black ink. Each problem is labeled in a child's calligraphic hand, showing that Emma took pride in the appearance of her schoolbook, and that these exercises afforded her further opportunity to practice her handwriting. Exercises in this schoolbook include financial transactions and topics, such as "Stocks," "Brokerage," and "Simple Interest," perhaps reflecting the visibility and importance of the Pease family's banking business at this time.</p>

                     <p>Contains compositions, in pen and black ink, by Henry Pease. Includes some instructor comments in red ink. Henry's compositions range in theme from English and world history, to ethics, to favorite hobbies and sports. Particularly notable are an essay "On the Pleasures of the Approaching Vacation," a piece debating warfare, and another about winter sports, which for Henry included snowballing, "sliding" (sledding), and skating.</p>

                     <p>The pages of this exercise book have been thriftily used during two separate years. The recto sides of the pages are dated 1823 and 1824, and the verso sides have been used (with the book flipped upside down) in 1825. The 1823/1824 portion contains Latin exercises; the 1825 portion consists of penmanship exercise. All are written in pen and black ink; some comments from an instructor or an older pupil--a John Irvine (or Irving)—appear on a few of Henry's Latin exercises.  Henry, in turn, notes where he has amended any errors. Moral values, as is typical of the Pease family schoolbooks, are promoted via the handwriting exercises throughout, with hard work and modesty being among the themes here.</p>

                     <p>This schoolbook is the joint project of four Pease sisters: Emma, Jane, Rachel, and Elizabeth. It contains various essays on topics such as who the best king of England was, and about the different seasons. All writing is in pen and black ink; a couple graphite sketches accompany one or two essays. Within the schoolbook, there are some creative compositions, including poems and "A Letter supposed to be written by the page of an English nobleman during the crusades to his sister at home, Ascalon (?), 1192." A very unexpected 1845 essay on Hydropathy as a treatment (something that had only just debuted in England in about 1843), is written by Elizabeth Lucy. Rachel's essay on "Winter" includes some poignant descriptions of "dirty" and "poor" children begging from door to door and avalanche victims in Switzerland. A graphite sketch of a rooster accompanies a piece on "the domestic cock" by Rachel Pease. All of the essay signatures indicate that they were written at Southend, the Darlington estate of Joseph Pease and the sisters' childhood home. The girls were most likely educated here.</p>
