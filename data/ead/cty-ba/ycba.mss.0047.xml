         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882) was an English poet, painter and translator. Born in London, Rossetti hailed from an artistically prodigious family; his Italian father was a Dante scholar while his sister, Christina Rossetti, became a renowned romantic poet and his brother, William Michael, an accomplished writer and critic. Like many members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Rossetti received his early artistic training at Sass's Drawing Academy, London, entering the school probably in 1841. In 1848, alongside William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and others, Rossetti founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of English painters, poets and critics. The Pre-Raphaelites sought to reform British art through a return to honest simplicity and the use of luminous colors and literary themes. Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites advocated for "truth to nature" in art, their work reflecting a mimesis of nature, rich detail and influences from Quattrocento Italian art. The Pre-Raphaelites received praise and endorsement from the influential art critic John Ruskin who boldly predicted that the Pre-Raphaelites would "lay in our land the foundations of a school of art nobler than has been seen for three hundred years" (Ruskin letter to <title>
               The Times
            </title>, 30 May 1851). Rossetti's <title>
               Girlhood of Mary Virgin
            </title> (1849) was the first work to be exhibited carrying the Brotherhood's initials. In addition to his drawing and paintings, Rossetti was a prolific writer, publishing many of his own poems and sonnets and producing a number of translations of Italian medieval poetry, including that of Dante Alighieri.</p>
         <p>The recipient of the letters, Ellen Heaton (1816-1894), was a Leeds based art collector and philanthropist. Heaton began collecting art after inheriting a significant amount of money and property following the deaths of her parents. Heaton's attention was first drawn to Rossetti's work by John Ruskin, a friend of Heaton's and someone from whom she often sought art collecting advice. Heaton was among the first to commission work by Rossetti and patronized, or considered patronizing, work by other artists associated with the Pre-Raphaelites, including Arthur Hughes, J.W. Inchbold and Edward Burne-Jones. Heaton was often referred to as having had a unique personality. In an 1863 letter to his father, Ruskin wrote, "Miss Heaton is – Miss Heaton, and always will be" (Sublime and Instructive, 151). Heaton was friendly with a number of writers and artists of her era, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning. Heaton never married. She traveled extensively throughout Great Britain and Europe, often with her domestic partner, Fanny Haworth. In addition to her direct support of artists through commissioned paintings and drawings, Heaton engaged in acts of cultural philanthropy, including providing the financial means for working men to attend lectures and supporting impoverished lace artisans in Leeds.</p>

            </title>, and <title>
               St. George and the Princess Sabra
            </title>. The letters reflect Heaton's reputation as an important collector and patron. Rossetti recommends (and, in some instances, requests) that she acquire work by many other artists associated with the Pre-Raphaelites, including Arthur Hughes, William Holman Hunt and Ford Maddox Brown.</p>
         <p>Rossetti's financial conduct and affairs are made apparent through his detailed instructions for Heaton regarding payment methods and frequency, his justifications for the price of works and his commentary on associations with art dealers and other patrons, including Thomas Plint, Walter Dunlop and the influential art critic John Ruskin. In addition to his business dealings, these letters offer insights into Rossetti's artistic process. In one letter, Rossetti expresses his relative displeasure for painting specially commissioned subjects, which often "never interested" him, and articulates his preference for painting subjects of his own devising (1856 March 12). Also evident in the correspondence is Rossetti's penchant for frequently altering his drawings and paintings, a trait which, in a letter to Ellen Heaton, Ruskin complained often resulted in these works developing "odd faults" (John Ruskin letter to Ellen Heaton, 1855 November 8). Rossetti's motivations behind his artistic decisions and alterations are described. For instance, Rossetti justifies his alteration of the size of Dante's feet in <title>
               Dante's Dream on the Day of the Death of Beatrice
            </title> as correcting their previous state of "being (I know not by what hallucination of my part) of the canoe class in shape and size" (1863 November 21). Another letter conveys his impatience to amend the "incautious use of red lead" in <title>
               St. George and the Princess Sabra
            </title> (1863 June 25).</p>
         <p>Rossetti expounds upon his thoughts on art and literature, recommending particular exhibitions, texts and works to Heaton. He encourages her to visit an 1856 exhibition of William Ward, Earl of Dudley's collection at the Egyptian Hall, London and – in the same year – recommends the works of Giotto on display at the Crystal Palace, London as the "finest sacred art I ever saw" (1856 May 12). The letters also convey the importance placed by Rossetti upon the contemporary British artistic and literary cultural scene and record his musings about his place within it. Rossetti makes frequent references to his and Heaton's mutual friends, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and gives his opinion that their writing is "glorious" and "almost beyond anything for exhaustless poetic resource," respectively (1865 November 13 and 1856 November 21). Rossetti explicates his philosophy that, while admiring the work of his contemporaries, he does not believe that artists should depict literary scenes created by writers working in their own period, remarking that he "never illustrate[s] modern writers as a rule, though once or twice I have done so with Browning only, from especial love of him. Such mingling of contemporary ideas is like the intermarriage of the same families, sure to lead to degeneracy" (1863 May 22).</p>
         <p>Rossetti makes frequent reference to John Ruskin, who initially introduced Heaton to Rossetti's work. The important role played by Ruskin in facilitating the relationships between the Pre-Raphaelites and their patrons is apparent; often, Rossetti desires Ruskin to view and approve of his completed works before sending them on to Heaton. In the second letter in the series, Rossetti expresses his indebtedness to Ruskin for first drawing Heaton's attention to his work.</p>
         <p>The correspondence also reveals the increasingly prominent role played by photography in documenting and distributing art as well as the limitations of the technology available. Rossetti frequently responds to Heaton's requests to have works photographed with the opinion that the subject in question will not photograph well. At one stage, Rossetti proclaims the attempt to photograph <title>
               Dante's dream at the time of the death of Beatrice
            </title> as a "bogie with a vengeance," bemoaning the darkening of one side of the image, arising as a result of "bungling."</p>
         <p>In some of the letters, sections of the page have been removed. These are often pieces containing Rossetti's crest and monograph, or his autograph signature. Presumably, Heaton wished to preserve these especially and in one letter Rossetti begrudgingly agrees to send samples of his signature to her, despite his "real horror of autography" (1863 November 21).</p>

               <p>Rossetti accepts Heaton's commission but asks whether, if he is unable to find complementary Dante subjects for two different works, he could produce one, larger work for no more than 40 guineas. Rossetti says he has already drawn a number of small Dante subjects and is worried he might not find new inspiration from Dante for small works. Rossetti describes works in progress depicting Dante and Beatrice, saying "they would execute well ... in water colour." Rossetti remarks that he has known a Dr. Hare for some time and says that he is indebted to John Ruskin for first drawing Rossetti to the attention of Heaton.</p>

               <p>Rossetti says that "owing to absence," Heaton's letter has only just reached him. Rossetti provides Heaton with Arthur Hughes's address and describes Hughes as "the one ... whose genius is, beyond a doubt, of the highest order." He says that he thinks Heaton would admire his works' "genuine poetry and originality." Rossetti ends by apologizing for the hastiness of his response, explaining he is busy with work.</p>

               <p>Rossetti expresses his hope that he can begin Heaton's commission and tells her that he will write to her if he commences the work while she is still in London so that she can visit him to see it. Rossetti admits that the "interruptions" delaying his work on Heaton's commission have also held up his other pieces and so he does not have anything "to show at present" but thanks Heaton for her continued interest. Rossetti is pleased that a gentleman has commissioned work from Arthur Hughes on Heaton's recommendation.</p>

               <p>Rossetti explains that he has been in Paris for the past ten days and so only just received Heaton's latest letter. Rossetti has heard from Ruskin that Heaton would prefer keeping the drawing from the <title>
                     Purgatorio of Rachel and Leah
                  </title>, or <title>
                     Matilda and Beatrice
                  </title>. Rossetti remarks that he has given Matilda and Beatrice the actions of Rachel and Leah and describes the two figures as "of an entirely Oriental character, as the real Rachel and Leah would be." Rossetti thanks Heaton for her second commission and tells her that he did not expect to be in Paris so long or her would have arranged to have his letters forwarded to him there. Rossetti thinks that the Exhibition of Pictures "does us [the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood?] credit" and praises the merits of exhibited works by Millais, Hunt and "Lewis and Leslie." Rossetti compliments the work of Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Kraus (Georg Melchior Kraus?). Rossetti admits that, like Heaton, he wishes Ruskin had attended the exhibition. Rossetti says he spent much of his time in Paris with the Brownings and passes on their kind regards to Heaton. Rossetti describes Robert Browning's "Men and Women" as "a glorious book."</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton that he is happy to make any changes she wishes to her commissioned drawing (<title>
                     Rachel and Leah
                  </title>) and instructs her on how to send it back to him. Rossetti admits he received Heaton's papers from Leeds but that he hadn't wanted to reply until he had some further information regarding her commission. Rossetti explains that he is more than half way towards completing a work depicting Dante's dream of Beatrice lying dead. He mentions that Ruskin has seen the partially completed piece and "seemed much pleased with it." Rossetti quotes the lines from Dante's <title>
                     Vita Nuova
                  </title> which inspire the piece and describes the work in detail, stating that "it is in every respect a much better drawing than [<title>
                     Rachel and Leah
                  </title>].". Rossetti admits that because the <title>
                     Rachel and Leah
                  </title> piece was commissioned, the subject "never interested" him. He tells Heaton that, as the work is now larger than first intended, the price will be 50 guineas but that he understands if Heaton cannot now purchase the work, the price being 10 guineas higher than previously agreed. Rossetti goes on to justify the price by saying that it is the usual asking price for his works and that Ruskin commissioned a much smaller piece from him for the same sum. Rossetti asks, if Heaton still wishes to commission the piece, to send him £20 "on account of it" or, if she no longer wants the work, to let him know as soon as is possible.</p>

He says that Ruskin has not seen his most recent work since it was about a third done as Rossetti asked Ruskin to wait to view it until it was finished. He says that he has not altered it "more than is unavoidable" and that it will be finished and framed before Heaton is next in town. Rossetti has not heard about the meeting at the Architectural Museum and apologizes that he cannot give Heaton the information she requested of him.</p>

               <p>Rossetti thanks Heaton for £30 she has sent him towards her commissioned drawing(s) worth 40 or 50 guineas. He assures her that he needed the money otherwise he would not have petitioned Ruskin to ask her for an advance. Rossetti describes ideas he has for drawings, including one of the Virgin Mary in the house of St. John after the crucifixion, stating that the motto on the frame could be "A little while and ye shall not see me, and again a little while ye shall see me." He describes the subject as "melancholy" and says he has two "modern" subjects which possess a "more happy aspect." Rossetti says he hopes Heaton will like his present drawing as much as Ruskin does and tells Heaton he will write to her once it is completed.</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton that he delayed sending her drawing as he has not received a response from Ruskin and that he had made appointments with friends to view it. He says that the drawing's packing case is prepared and that the drawing should be ready for transportation as soon as Ruskin replies. Rossetti says he has still to decide whether to make Heaton's latest commission one or two drawings and will not know until he has finished one drawing when he will know whether to produce another. Rossetti says he hopes he will be able to make Heaton a sketch of The Virgin and St John and that he hopes to see Heaton in the forthcoming Friday as he has a previously arranged appointment on Wednesday. Rossetti mentions that an old friend of his, Edward Bateman, was an acquaintance of Heaton's, remarking that he fears Bateman's "talents must be very much wasted on the Australians."</p>

               <p>"The drawing has been to Oxford, and is just back -- I suspect unfortunately without catching Mr. Ruskin. Will fix a day and hour most suitable to you after Monday, when you can see it. If equally pleasing to you, I would like to keep it by me a few days yet, that one or two friends may see it." In a postscript, Rossetti asks if the time Heaton choses is unsuitable for him whether he might be able to suggest another time. Rossetti tells Heaton that, although she would like to see his work, he only has two drawings in progress and that one of them has been borrowed by Ruskin.</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes to Heaton for his delayed response. He tells Heaton he will be happy to show his drawings to Arabella Moulton Barrett, if Heaton arranges an appointment. Rossetti admits that he thinks there is "little [art] worth seeing" in London at the present moment, except for the Royal Academy exhibition. Rossetti notes that the Royal Academy has not exhibited Robert Browning's portrait, despite having accepted it. Rossetti recommends pictures from the collection of William Ward, Earl of Dudley, which are on public display at the Egyptian Hall, and works from Giotto in the Crystal Palace which Rossetti proclaims the "finest sacred art [he] ever saw." Rossetti says that he has spoken to William Holman Hunt on Heaton's behalf and that Hunt is happy to show her his most recent work.</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton that William Holman Hunt has suggested the next day, at 3 o'clock for his meeting with Arabella Moulton Barrett and asks Heaton to tell Hunt if they can make that time, saying if they can't that they should write to Hunt to rearrange the appointment. Rossetti asks Heaton if he could send the drawing she commissioned from him to a Mrs. Marshall, of Eaton Square, who has been ill and would like to see it, assuring Heaton that Marshall shall keep it for one day only. He has already arranged for it to be sent as he assumed Heaton would not object. He mentions that Marshall has a brother in Leeds who Heaton might know. Rossetti provides Heaton with Hunt's address and gives her instructions on how to find Hunt's house, which is difficult to find.</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes for the delay in sending Heaton's drawing which he has now sent along with a sketch of Dante. He has sent the <title>
                     Rachel and Leah
                  </title> case as it reached him, with a broken lid. He says he has a case for the <title>
                     Dante
                  </title> which was not made for it bespoke but which was created by Ruskin's frame maker. Rossetti thinks the case may have been sent to Ruskin's address in Oxford. Rossetti says he hopes he will have the St. John sketch ready to show Heaton before she leaves London. He asks if the drawing of Dante will remain in London after Heaton leaves, expressing his desire to have it easily available to him, should he like to make alterations. In a postscript Rossetti says he thinks that the Brownings will be in London by the 1st of July at the very latest.</p>

I believe the Brownings leave for Florence on Saturday, as perhaps you know. If you are at a loss for some one to take charge of my drawing in London (as I think you said it would not go to Leeds with you) I shall be happy to do so." In a postscript: "I deferred answering your note till near the end of the period of your stay, lest I might have something by then."</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton that the subjects he is working on for inclusion in a new work by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, are <title>
                     The Palace of Art
                  </title>, <title>
                     Sir Galahad
                  </title>, <title>
                     The Lady of Shalott
                  </title>, <title>
                     Mariana in the South
                  </title> and possibly the <title>
                     Vision of Sin.
                  </title> He describes the drawing of the <title>
                     Palace of Art
                  </title> as being inspired by Tennyson's lines about St. Cecily and says it was commissioned as a watercolor. Rossetti says that if he does not find the repetition too unpleasant, he will produce a duplicate of the work for Heaton but only after he has finished his present work. Rossetti urges Heaton to acquire works by Ford Madox Brown, saying that he has only a few small works left. Rossetti describes Madox Brown's <title>
                     Our Lady of Good Children,
                  </title> a chalk drawing from <title>
                     Beauty and the Beast
                  </title> and a drawing of the <title>
                     Virgin Mary
                  </title>. He provides Heaton with Madox Brown's address and assures Heaton that Brown's work will only increase in value now that "the tide of justice is at last beginning to set in toward [Madox Brown]." Rossetti notes that Madox Brown's <title>
                     Christ Washing Peter's Feet
                  </title> received the Liverpool prize. Rossetti goes on to praise Arthur Hughes, expressing his disappointment that neither he, nor Madox Brown, have been included in the Tennyson work. Rossetti thanks Heaton for her enquiry after the health of Elizabeth Siddall, who is currently in Bath. He states that he would like it if Siddall went to a warmer region for the winter. Rossetti hopes that Siddall and Heaton will one day meet as Siddall "could have no kinder or better friend." Rossetti praises Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <title>
                     Aurora Leigh
                  </title> as "almost beyond anything for exhaustless poetic resource" and as possessing the potential to reveal social truths as did Tennyson's <title>
                     Maud.
                  </title> Rossetti expresses his happiness in hearing that Barrett Browning is in better health.</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes for his delayed response to Heaton's last letter. He wishes Heaton a merry Christmas. Rossetti says that if he had known that his response would be delayed, he would have written to Heaton to say that he was not sure about the price of the St George watercolour until he was further along with it. He admits that he has been unable to work much on the piece due to other commissions ill health of his wife, Elizabeth Siddall, which prevented her from sitting for the work. He promises that the work will be finished soon and gives its price as 65 guineas, a "very low price compared to many things [Rossetti] has done lately." Rossetti says he has offered Heaton this low price as he is anxious to sell the piece, despite a previous, smaller and less accomplished work selling for 55 guineas, some years ago. Rossetti enquires after a picture that has been sold to a Mr. Miller of Liverpool and expresses his surprise that the work (from the Plint estate) had gone to market. Rossetti asks whether Heaton has been in touch with any of their friends, including her sister and brother-in-law. [The remainder of the letter is lacking.]</p>

               <p>Rossetti is saddened by the death of Mrs. Plint and asked how her children will be looked after. He asks Heaton when the children will be able to benefit from the sale of their mother's collection. Rossetti expresses his happiness that his <title>
                     St George
                  </title> was liked by Ruskin but that he would not make the sale of any of his works dependent on Ruskin's approval. Rossetti says he is offering Heaton the <title>
                     St George
                  </title> at a price "certainly below [his] usual scale of late.". Rossetti complains that artists are at present having difficulty in finding markets for their works while "dealers seem able to make profit enough." Rossetti says the <title>
                     St George
                  </title> should be ready in about a week and says he would be happy to show it to Ruskin before sending it to Heaton. Rossetti asks Heaton not to write about it to Ruskin until Ruskin returns from his travels as "his father opens all his letters in his absence, which is hardly what one reckons on when writing to him of one's affairs."</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes to Heaton for asking her to send her most recent payment to him by P.O. order rather than check at a time when she is unwell and tells her not to organize the order until she is better. Rossetti remarks that "everyone seems to have had these attacks lately" and that "we may see that they need care to be taken at once, as one has heard lately of so many bad cases beginning  with colds of this kind." Rossetti says that he will send Heaton the <title>
                     St. George
                  </title> by the time Heaton specifies and explains that he has not made the "out-of-window bit" brighter, claiming it would create an imbalance of light in the work. Rossetti tells Heaton that Ruskin is visiting him on the day of writing the letter and he can "give no particulars as to [Ruskin's] apparent state when I last saw him, because to tell truth his account of himself was discouraging." Rossetti cannot take the photograph of the oil painting requested by Heaton as it "would be sure to prove a distressing failure." Rossetti recommends Edward Burne-Jones's work <title>
                     Cupid and Psyche Sharpening Arrows
                  </title> to Heaton, remarking that she "could not possibly make a more delightful acquisition." Rossetti ends by telling Heaton that Robert Browning had seen Heaton's <title>
                     St George
                  </title> and expressed a desire to tell Heaton herself what he thought of it.</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes for his delay in writing to Heaton. He admits that Ruskin did not view the <title>
                     St George
                  </title> again, as Ruskin was so delayed in arranging a viewing that Rossetti thought it best to send the drawing to Heaton. Rossetti describes the picture of <title>
                     St George
                  </title> saying "his attention is for the moment diverted by the shouts and trumpeting outside and that he is gazing out toward the procession and crowd." Rossetti promises Heaton that if he has any uncomisssioned work he thinks will please her, he will let her know. Rossetti will send Heaton pieces for a charity exhibition but admits that the only two pieces he has are a watercolor portrait of Robert Browning and a pen and ink drawing from <title>
                     Le Morte d'Arthur.
                  </title> He tells Heaton he will send her the works and requests that she return them the day following the exhibition. Rossetti says that there was a good review of his <title>
                     The early Italian poets
                  </title> in the <title>
                     Spectator
                  </title> a few weeks earlier "but it a sort of work that takes time  to get up by a competent reviewer, though fools rush in and the best will necessarily be the latest."</p>

                  </title> to Green and so cannot further alter it, saying that he thought it was better with the previous changes. Rossetti admits that he cannot tell Heaton exactly what Mr. Ruskin said of the piece because he can't remember Ruskin's comments except that "the picture pleased him decidedly." Rossetti promises to mention the "matter of the presentation" to his friend Mr. Rose. Rossetti is sorry that he does not have a day to spare on his return from Newcastle, or he would have visited Leeds and Liverpool on his way home. In a postscript, Rossetti says that he has seen Robert Browning and his son, who is "vastly improved and quite robust."</p>

               <p>Rossetti thanks Heaton for sending a pamphlet by Edmund Bates and expresses his pleasure that Bates enjoys his picture. Rossetti says he is concerned about his <title>
                     St John
                  </title> and is impatient to correct it. He admits that he made a similar mistake with another watercolor through "incautious use of red lead." Rossetti asks Heaton if she could send him the work. Rossetti is happy in his new home and says he would be glad to show Heaton his old one. He has not heard from Ruskin but is much more at ease with him. Rossetti regrets that he has not responded to Mr and Mrs Aldam Heaton and says he sent them his good wishes at the end of the year, and asks Heaton that she also passes them on. In a postscript, Rossetti says when he wrote to Mr. Heaton it was regarding the painting of a portrait of a Mrs. Leathart.</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton he can offer Heaton a picture of Helen (since she is no longer the subject of his commission for Mr. Rose) or Beatrice. Rossetti can begin the work straight away and gives the price for the piece as 120 guineas, 50 to be paid at the commencement of the work, 35 when presented in advance of completion and 35 upon delivery. Rossetti does not doubt that he can complete it before Heaton leaves London, if he can begin work on it immediately. Rossetti says that Jeptha's daughter (as "a mere shadow") is incapable of functioning as the subject of a work "unless [it is] a dramatic one, of various figures including the incident connected with her." Rossetti muses that his treatment of this (or any other subject) should be independent from that of Tennyson's, stating that he "never illustrate[s] modern writers as a rule, though once or twice I have done so with Browning only, from especial love of him. Such mingling of contemporary ideas is like the intermarriage of the same families, sure to lead to degeneracy."</p>

               <p>Rossetti suggests that Heaton and Mrs. Gurney postpone their visit until he is better prepared as he does not have much work to show them. Rossetti says he will have more work, including "your Beatrice," at a more advanced stage later (actually a reference to <title>

               <p>Rossetti has received word from his Christina Rossetti that Heaton would like a copy of one of the photos Rossetti has recently taken of Ruskin. Rossetti says he will send Heaton one, once they are printed but requests that she keeps it strictly in her possession, as a matter of legality. Rossetti is a little perturbed with Heaton's Beatrice painting, as the model he has employed to sit for the work differs in appearance from Beatrice's described appearance. Rossetti asks if he can change the work's subject to the bride from Solomon's Song, to better fit the model (a work that became <title>
                     The Beloved
                  </title>). Rossetti invites Heaton to view the completed head of the piece. Rossetti ends: "Hoping letter does not seem alarming as regards the picture, which promise you shall in any case be a thoroughly good specimen of work."</p>

               <p>Rossetti promises Heaton that he has not forgotten her photograph of Ruskin but that he does not have one to send her at present. He tells Heaton Tuesday would be best for her to visit him, and offers a time of 5:30 pm or before 11am. Rossetti says that the Beatrice must be turned into Solomon's Bride and states that he will title the work <title>
                     The King's Daughter
                  </title> (i.e. <title>
                     The Beloved
                  </title>). Rossetti thinks that Heaton will still want the piece but, if she doesn't, he will paint her a Beatrice when he can find an appropriate model. He thinks Jane Morris would be suitable but that hiring her "would cause loss of time and patience" if indeed she is available. He states that "to paint it from any study, without nature, would be impossible."</p>

               <p>Rossetti apologizes for his delayed response; he has been in Brighton for two days. Rossetti admits he sent Heaton's drawing without a case (which had gone missing) and trusted his frame-maker to pack it carefully. Rossetti regrets that he will not have the two additional figures included in his picture by the end of the following week, as he has many earlier deadlines for other works. Rossetti apologizes if this means that Heaton will not be able to view the work before she leaves London but says that he can give her an idea of its arrangement by sending her a pen and ink sketch of what he proposes. The two additional figures would be "2 dark girls harping." Rossetti thinks that decisions regarding the work should be postponed until it is more advanced. In any case, he "might possibly be beginning a Beatrice if a model turned up." Rossetti asks Heaton how she likes his new writing paper (which features Rossetti's crest, monogram and Cheyne Walk address).</p>

               <p>Rossetti expresses his happiness that Heaton's "charming class of critics" like his work and says he is happy to show any of them his studio. Rossetti says he has heard from Ruskin, who is en route to England. Rossetti is making two Dante drawings for Lady Ashburton, jointly titled <title>
                     The salutation of Beatrice,
                  </title> which are similarly composed to works Rossetti showed Heaton in oil. These works are in watercolor. Rossetti describes a piece he is currently working on as depicting "a lady plaiting her golden hair" in oil (<title>
                     Fazio's mistress
                  </title>). (Here, a piece of the letter measuring 2 cm x 11.3 cm is cut away.) Rossetti asks Heaton for the <title>
                     Dante's Dream
                  </title> and requests that she send it alongside the <title>
                     St George
                  </title> for alteration. Rossetti compares Heaton's <title>
                     St John
                  </title> to Lady Trevelyan's, saying Heaton's is "more forcible" and Trevelyan's "the more finished."</p>

                  </title> unchanged but says he knows how he can revise it and greatly improve it. He states he can heighten its colour and removed the "stiffness, smallness of execution" in the work but that it would take a week or a fortnight to change and could only be done as a commission. If Heaton does not wish Rossetti to carry out the alterations, Rossetti states he will not need to keep the drawing long. Rossetti says he will try to photograph the work but he does not expect the endeavor to be "very promising." In a postscript, Rossetti suggests that Heaton has the work's frame and the inscription replaced and asks if he should arrange for this to be carried out.</p>

               <p>Rossetti says he has not made any alterations to <title>
                     Dante's dream
                  </title> except to make Dante's feet smaller, "they being (I know not by what hallucination on my part) of the canoe class in shape and size." Rossetti agrees it is better to remain unchanged. Rossetti has not yet used the picture and asks if Heaton will allow him to keep it a little longer, especially as she intends to "defer its return ... for a much less important object -- namely its loan to Mr. Ruskin." Rossetti will have the frame repaired. Rossetti will send Heaton some samples of his autograph as she asked but admits his delay in doing so is a result of his "real horror of autography."</p>

               <p>Rossetti has received an offer for <title>
                     The beloved
                  </title> and asks Heaton if she is no longer interested in the work. He says he has done no further work to the piece but has extended his plans for it so he can no longer paint it for 200 guineas, the price he first named for Heaton. Rossetti asks if he could paint her something else and says he has not forgotten the £50 she has given him for a painting of Beatrice. Rossetti has found a partly completed picture of his wife in oil, begun as a picture of Beatrice, which might possibly be able to be worked into a painting depicting Beatrice falling asleep by a wall and a sundial (<title>
                     Beata Beatrix
                  </title>). Rossetti apologizes for keeping the <title>

                  </title> for so long and says he will try to get a photograph of it while he still has it.</p>

                  </title> was taken by Ruskin on the day prior to his father's death, in order for Ruskin to photograph it. He assures her that nothing has been altered in the piece.

               <p>Rossetti asks Heaton to visit him on Friday at 4 pm or after, or on Saturday at 12 noon or 1 pm to see her <title>
                     Sir Galahad

Rossetti has visited the "smelling little shops" and has "got one on approval to show [Heaton]." Rossetti proclaims that the photograph of <title>

                  </title> is "a bogie with a vengeance," bemoaning its colours and the fact that one side of the photo is darker than the other, "which must be owing to bungling."</p>

               <p>Rossetti is concerned that Heaton believes her commissioned drawing to be small in relation to its price. Rossetti tells her that Mr. Dunlop recently paid 100 guineas each for two of his drawings, a price paid by others to Mr. Gambart (a dealer) for similar ones. Rossetti cites another instance in which a drawing smaller than the <title>
                     Sir Galahad
                  </title> had fetched 120 guineas and says that 100 guineas has become his standard rate for private commissions. He suggests that if Heaton looks at Dunlop's drawings, she will see that she is receiving more work for the same price. Despite Heaton's kind words about the <title>
                     Sir Galahad
                  </title>, Rossetti is writing to her "to remove any impression, however slight, that [he is] treating so faithful a friend and purchaser as [Heaton] at any disadvantage compared with others."</p>

               <p>Rossetti hopes it will be possible to set Heaton's mind at rest about "the lily" but he is not sure he will be able to. Rossetti asks Heaton if she would prefer a drawing "of "the small figure kind to the <title>
                     Joan of Arc
                  </title>," which he would be happy to substitute for it, provided Heaton lets him know if she would like one as soon as possible. The price of the drawing would be 100 guineas. Rossetti tells Heaton that his mother is sitting for him the following day and asked if Heaton would like to join them. He tells her to come at any time of the day, that they will dine at 7 pm and that his sister, Maria and Dr. and Mrs. Hesinam will be coming in the evening.</p>

                     Joan of Arc
                  </title> by the end of the week. Rossetti hopes Heaton will like it "as everyone says it is one of my best things. I myself (entre nous) consider it superior in expression and colour to the oil picture." Rossetti has told Mr. Rose that Heaton would show him her pictures if she visited her. Rossetti tells Heaton that he is going to Paris on the advice of his doctor and asks if he can "fetch, carry or bring anything" for her. He ends by saying that the <title>
                     Sir Galahad

Rossetti states that the letter Heaton mentioned in a previous letter is a Whistler and the one signed "Ned" is a Jones and mentions that he had asked Christina Rossetti to describe them to Heaton. He ends: "Lady Ashburton has not gone fasting through the fact of my artistic provender here being all bespoke. She has given me several commissions, one being a small Joan of Arc."</p>

               <p>Rossetti tells Heaton that it is "against [his] interests" to exhibit his work at present, unless it is work "of great importance." "I hold a fortunate position at present in possessing a market unassailable by incompetence, ill-will, or to put it in its mildest and frequently true form, by mere diversity of taste. You will greatly oblige me therefore by declining to send anything of mine; and indeed I have lately made the stipulation, when parting with works, that they are not to be exhibited without my consent." The paper has been trimmed on the third and fourth pages, with partial loss of content. Rossetti is apparently asking Heaton if she could loan him one of his works commissioned by her -- perhaps <title>
                     Dante's dream
                  </title> -- to help him in working on a new piece. Rossetti offers to produce a sketch for Heaton in exchange for the loan.</p>
