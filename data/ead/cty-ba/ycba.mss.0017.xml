         <p>The collection comprises manuscripts, original art and printed material by and about Richard Shirley Smith, collected by Roger W. Moss. A description of the collection is provided in the forward to Moss's checklist, <title render="italic">
               Richard Shirley Smith: illustrated books, engravings and bookplates: annotated checklist, Roger W. Moss Collection
            </title> (Marlborough, England : Libanus Press, 2010):</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>This checklist of Richard Shirley Smith's illustrated books, engravings and bookplates is intended to compliment lain Bain's <title render="italic">
                  Wood Engravings of Richard Shirley Smith
               </title> (Cambridge, 1994), Shirley Smith's <title render="italic">
                  Paintings &amp; Collages
               </title> (London, 2002), and Brian North Lee's <title render="italic">
                  Bookplates by Richard Shirley Smith
               </title> (Fleece Press, 2005). It also documents my own collection begun after I commissioned Shirley Smith to produce a millennium year ex libris for books acquired by an endowment in my name at The Athenaeum of Philadelphia. Since I could never hope to own more than a few of his paintings and none of his <emph render="italic">trompe l'oeil</emph> murals--many of which are in privately-owned country houses--I focused on the books he has illustrated over the past half century. Eventually I added original strikes of virtually all the engravings and bookplates as well, including items unrecorded by Iain Bain and Brian North Lee. From the beginning the collection was destined for an appropriate institution in the United States where the work of this versatile artist is not as well known as it should be. In England collections of Shirley Smith's engravings already exist at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford and also in London at the British Museum and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The Bodleian Library have asked to receive his main archive.</p>

            <p>Richard Shirley Smith was born in London (1935) and educated at Harrow and the Slade School of Fine Art. After a year and a half of further study in Rome, he returned to England in 1962 to support his young family as a freelance graphic designer for commercial publishers. Richard was not encouraging when I began to collect these early books, preferring that I concentrate on the finely printed limited editions of his mature work. But these early commissions paid the bills and gave him practical experience in book design and publishing. Most were for dust jackets, but occasionally he was asked to illustrate an entire book. He produced fifty drawings for Wilfrid Blunt's <title render="italic">
                  Of Flowers &amp; A Village
               </title> (Hamish Hamilton, 1963), and for each of the nine biographies of musicians by Percy M. Young published by Ernest Benn he provided at least a dozen drawings that ranged from portraits to landscapes and architecture. Fortunately for his later career, some publishers recognized the exceptional quality of his wood engravings, which were far more tedious and time consuming to produce than the mono-types and drawings typically commissioned. Shirley Smith's engraved portrait of Sir Thomas More set against a detailed London background, for example, was commissioned by Burns &amp; Oates and used for several of Ernest Edwin Reynolds's books published in both England and the United States.</p>

            <p>It was the art directors at Faber and Faber who particularly favoured Shirley Smith's wood engravings. Ten of these appeared in their edition of Douglas Bartrum's <title render="italic">
                  The Gourmet's Garden
               </title> (1964) and another ten in Elizabeth Clarke's <title render="italic">
                  The Darkening Green
               </title> (1964). The discipline of working against a publisher's deadline for a set of ten original engravings would be valuable experience in the future.</p>

            <p>Often a catalogue raisonné--or even a simple, chronological checklist such as this one--illuminates important turning points in an artist's career. For Richard Shirley Smith, 1967 stands out. In that year, seventeen of his wood engravings dating from his studies in Rome were featured by The Golden Head Press in a slim volume of Joyce Finzi's poetry; The Folio Society published thirty of his wood engravings commissioned for their limited edition of <title render="italic">
                  Sir Roger de Coverly
               </title>; and in New York, Macmillan released <title render="italic">
                  Memoirs of a London Doll
               </title> illustrated with fifteen commissioned wood engravings.</p>

            <p>The 1967 projects prompted the typographical advisor and historian John Dreyfus (1918-2002), who was an agent for the Limited Editions Club in the United States, to suggest Shirley Smith as the illustrator for Stephen Spender's selection of Shelley's poems which was published in 1971. For this commission he executed forty-six wood engravings. Of this project Richard wrote: 'I think ... this was my "masterpiece" as regards engraving' and John Dreyfus would later remark, Shirley Smith 'was able to render intricate details of architecture, landscape, seascape, flora, fauna and the human face--all with equal mastery and with astonishing control of perspective and the lighting of the different planes.' Laurence Whistler, brother of Rex Whistler, and an artist who recognized genius when he encountered it, wrote 'here is an artist whose scope is not narrow. With equal skill he handles the charming simplicities of doll's house furniture, portraits, houses, food, insects, animals, flowers--and scenes of imagination. In the end it is the last-named that catch and hold the attention. He seems to have discovered his true gift while interpreting, or simply responding to, poetry.'</p>

            <p>Shirley Smith had left behind his journeyman work as an engraver and illustrator for commercial publishers. Henceforth he would be in demand by The Folio Society, Oxford University Press, and private press publishers such as Libanus, Rocket, Fleece, and Gruffyground which featured his engravings, line drawings, and paintings in finely bound, limited and signed editions, including such publications as Hugh Shankland's <title render="italic">
                  Messer Pietro Mio
               </title> (1985). Concurrently, several well publicized exhibitions such as his fiftieth birthday retrospective at the Ashmolean Museum and the Royal Institute of British Architects, and several books and articles that are listed in the first section of this checklist have helped to create a steady demand for his easel paintings, murals and fine and limited edition book illustrations.</p>
            <p>Since that modest commission to design my book plate, Richard Shirley Smith and I have developed a cordial trans-Atlantic friendship that has given me considerable pleasure. Without his cooperation and encouragement neither the collection nor this publication would have been possible. Roger W. Moss, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

                  <p>Colophon reads: 'There are 275 copies of this book, and it has been a pleasure to print some of the very best bookplates ever made. Of these, forty copies (thirty-two for sale) contain a chemise holding four proofs of drawn bookplates, signed by the artist. The paper is T. H. Saunders HP, the type Van Dijck set at Whittington by Peter Pugwash Sanderson, and the reproductions of the bookplates were printed by Smith Settle, who also bound the book.' This is one of the 32 copies with four drawn bookplates [North Lee nos. 36, 40, 43, 52] signed and dated by Shirley Smith. Quarter bound in tan book cloth, boards covered in wood-grain paper; the clamshell box is covered in matching cloth lined with wood-grain paper. Note to Roger W. Moss from Simon Lawrence, The Fleece Press, laid in. Booklet 'More Fleece Press Books for 2005' (printed in an edition limited to 1200 copies) also laid in.</p>
                  <p>This lavish catalogue of Shirley Smith's bookplates produced through 2003 was one of North Lee's last publications; in it he assigned numbers to the bookplates that are used throughout this checklist. For Shirley Smith's bookplates created after 2003 the numbering sequence has been continued. See bookplate list (Section III).</p>

Bain assigns it no. 257 for its appearance in David Burnett's Vines (1984), although it clearly predates that printing. The exhibition which this collection of wood engravings accompanied was a tribute to the growing interest in wood engraving in the North East of England. It was a joint venture sponsored partly by the Durham Light Infantry Museum and Arts Centre and partly by Collingwood College in the University of Durham.</p>

                  <p>This first retrospective of Shirley Smith's wood engravings is by Sir Laurence Whistler (1912-2000), the brother of Rex Whistler (1905-1944), who remarks, 'It needs only a glance through these pages to discover that here is an artist whose scope is not narrow. With equal skill he handles the charming simplicities of doll's house furniture, portraits, houses, food, insects, animals, flowers—and scenes of imagination. In the end it is the last-named that catches and holds the attention. He seems to have discovered his true gift while interpreting, or simply responding to, poetry.'</p>

Here Shirley Smith's trompe l'oeil murals, the first of which he executed in 1976 for owners of the Doric Villa in Regent's Park, were properly credited.</p>

                  <p>Typeset in Monotype Postscript Bembo by The Folio Society. Text printed at St Edmundsbury Press, Bury St Edmunds, on Hamilton Wove paper. Color plates printed at Barwell Colourprint, Midsomer Norton, on Sovereign Matt Cartridge paper. Bound in blue-gray book cloth at Hunter &amp; Foulis, Edinburgh. Slipcase collage by Paul W. Nash. Richard Shirley Smith illustrated five books for The Folio Society prior to 1996, including Sir Richard de Coverly (1967) [no. 233; page 129]; Philip Stanhope (1973) [no. 327; page 152]; Robert Browning, Dramatic Monologues (1991) [no. 689; page 240]; Perfect and Imperfect Enjoyments (1992) [no. 725; page 252]; and Ovid, Metamorphoses (1995) [no. 812; page 275]. In each instance the citation in Folio 50 is accompanied by a reproduction of one Shirley Smith illustration for the book, including a full page from the Ovid on page 277. Shirley Smith subsequently contributed to four books for The Folio Society: prints for The Folio Golden Treasury designed by Simon Brett (1997); cover designs for Shakespeare, Complete Plays (1997); frontispiece and 21 line drawings for Virgil, The Ecologues (2000); and cover design for Carcopino, Daily Life in Ancient Rome (2004).</p>

                  <p>Limited edition of 140 copies signed and numbered by Shirley Smith of which this is copy no. 82. Contained in a chemise are two wood engravings dating to 1961 signed and numbered by Shirley Smith: 'A Winter Night' and 'The Dark Tower,' both of which were first published in A Point of Departure by Joyce Finzi [Bain nos. 13 and 23]. Quarter bound in dark gray book cloth with decoratively printed boards and a light gray cloth-covered slipcase. Three items laid in: color prospectus for the publication; limited edition order form; and special pre-publication order form with note on verso to Roger W. Moss from Shirley Smith concerning the satisfactory reproduction of two acrylic paintings from his collection reproduced in the book.</p>
                  <p>Sir Roy Strong remarks, 'Shirley Smith's wood engravings fit neatly into the world of Rex Whistler and Reynolds Stone, and are quite as fine as anything produced by either of them. The bookplates make a distinguished contribution to that genre: delightful masterpieces in miniature, deploying his usual architectural repertory of urns, altars and fragments of friezes through and over which sprout greenery and flowers.'</p>

                  <p>While most important for its reproductions of Shirley Smith's paintings and collages and his carefully compiled list of 281 framed and three-dimensional works, this book also contains a useful chronology of his personal life and professional career up to 2000. Also listed are the main exhibitions, trompe l'oeil mural decorations, periodical articles, and illustrated reference books—many of which are included in this checklist. However, the list of illustrated books is incomplete due mainly to Shirley Smith's modestly concerning the journeywork of his early career.</p>

                  <p>Richard Shirley Smith's long association with the Finzi family is commemorated here by the use of his 1961 wood engravings first published in Joy Finzi's A Point of Departure (1967) which are reproduced on pages 90, 92, 94, 97, 100, 102 and 220. Also included in this anthology is a reprint of Jeremy Dale Roberts's review of Shirley Smith's The Paintings and Collages which originally appeared in the Finzi Friends Newsletter [item 31 above]. Laid in are photocopies of the obituaries of Joy Finzi from The Telegraph (June 6, 1991), The Guardian (June 19, 1991), and Shirley Smith's reminiscences of her from Joy Finzi, 1907-1991: Tributes from her friends.</p>

                  <p>Printed by Crampton &amp; Sons, Ltd., Sawston, Cambridge. First edition. Seventeen wood engravings [Bain nos. 11–27]. Detail of 'The Dark Tower' [Bain no. 23] used as a four side bleed on the front cover. Sewn soft binding.</p>
                  <p>While staying with Shirley Smith and his first wife in the hills east of Rome, Joyce Finzi, widow of the composer Gerald Finzi, was working on a collection of poems entitled 'The division of one is two'. These inspired this series of wood engravings which, without being direct illustrations, added a visual counter-point to the theme of departure which runs through the whole collection. This was the first publication of Shirley Smith's suite of Rome engravings created in 1961.</p>

                  <p>Set in 11-point monotype Baskerville and printed by Richard Clay at the Chaucer Press, Bungay, Suffolk. The illustrations consist of a frontispiece portrait of Addison and Steele and 30 wood-engraved head pieces [Bain nos. 85-115], one used at the opening of each essay. Shirley Smith also engraved a decorative rule, which is used beneath each head piece and on the title page. Bound by W. and J. Mackay in quarter brown buckram, marbled paper boards, green end papers. Brown slip case.</p>
                  <p>This book project––Shirley Smith's first for The Folio Society––would presage his later career as the illustrator of fine limited editions; it was also his first major commission for a large number of his engravings. The year 1967 would prove to be a turning point in his career.</p>

The booklet has been quarter bound in black book cloth with marbled paper-cover boards.</p>
                  <p>In 1969 and 1970, while Shirley Smith was Head of the Art Department at Marlborough College, he travelled to the Vento to photograph art and architecture. A third expedition was made in 1971 and this set of four film strips was the result. While the effort was not a financial success, the experience of closely examining the works of Palladio, Veronese, and the sculptor Vittoria at such sites as Maser and the Villa Barbaro influenced his later murals and framed paintings.</p>

                  <p>Designed by John Dreyfus and printed at the University Printing House in Cambridge by Brooke Crutchley, Printer to the University. Forty-six engravings [Bain nos. 165-210]. Edition of 1500 copies signed and numbered by Shirley Smith of which this is copy no. 793. Quarter bound in leather with orange book cloth boards impressed with oval relief (60 mm) portrait of Shelley. Slip case. A copy of The Monthly Letter of the Limited Editions Club (December, 1971, no. 450) laid in.</p>
                  <p>The Shelley project––commissioned by the Limited Editions Club in the United States in 1969 at the suggestion of John Dreyfus-- was printed in 1971 and reprinted by the Heritage Press in 1974. This was Shirley Smith's largest book project in terms of the number of commissioned wood engravings. He would later write, 'I think the word "masterpiece" originally referred to the piece of work, that divides the apprentice from the professional; in which case this was my "masterpiece" as regards engraving.' The Paintings &amp; Collages, p. 10.</p>

                  <p>A keepsake illustrated by Richard Shirley Smith and printed at the Libanus Press, Hermitage, Berkshire. Quarto single sheet (302 x 211 mm). Colophon on verso reads: 'This broadside was printed at the Libanus Press, Hermitage, Berkshire, in November 1977, and is limited to one hundred and fifty copies signed by the engraver. This is No. 88.' The text is handset in 18- point Perpetua type, printed on dampened Amalfi white laid paper on the artist's Albion handpress of 1860. Wood-engraved portrait of Erasmus [1965; Bain no. 82] above two paragraphs from In Praise of Folly (1508) with Shirley Smith's engraved 'cone ribbons' logo for Libanus Press [Bain no. 235] on verso. In original Libanus Press envelope.</p>
                  <p>This keepsake marks the beginning of Richard Shirley Smith's long and fruitful association with Libanus Press. Michael Mitchell has been an important friend and collaborator over several decades. He exhibited Shirley Smith's work at his Katharine House Gallery, commissioned and published many of his illustrations and engravings, and expertly printed many of his books and bookplates.</p>

                  <p>Designed, handset in Bodoni italic, and printed on Vélin d'Arches mould-made paper by Michael Mitchell at the Libanus Press, Marlborough, Wiltshire, for Anthony Baker of the Gruffyground Press, Ladram, Sidcot, Winscombe, Somerset. Shirley Smith pearwood engraving [Rhinoceros Beetle on title page; Bain no. 251] printed from the original block. The Libanus Press logo by Shirley Smith also appears on the colophon page [1975; Bain no. 235]. The edition is limited to two hundred copies; one hundred copies are signed by Shirley Smith and John Heath-Stubbs. The cover is ochre Mingei handmade paper wrapper printed in black. Sewn soft binding.</p>
                  <p>According to Mark Askam, Gruffyground Press: A Bibliography, 1972-2007 (see item 36 above), John Heath-Stubbs wrote two slightly different versions of the poem 'Silverfish'. He could not decide which version to use, so it was decided that one half of the publication would be printed with one version of the poem and the other half with the other. In this copy, the end of line four in the first stanza of 'Silverfish' ends with 'Secondary Epoch'. Being completely blind, John Heath-Stubbs had to have his hand placed in the correct position on each colophon page in order to sign the copies. This accounts for the huge variation in his signatures and their most interesting, if rather illegible, nature.</p>

Prospectus for the Messer Pietro Mio project together with a copy of Libanus Press, Book List for 1986 (4Pp.) laid in. The engravings for Messer Pietro Mio were cut between 1977 and 1985 and published in 1985. According to the prospectus the engravings reflect 'the metaphorical, heraldic and surreal elements contained in the letters.' They were the last major suite of wood engravings Shirley Smith produced before a detached retina at the age of fifty forced him to stop engraving and to concentrate on drawn images. According to Shirley Smith, only 30 of the projected 100 boxed sets of the engravings were actually assembled and distributed.</p>

                  <p>Moss discusses a house museum he helped restore in Deadwood, South Dakota, and suggests inquiring into printing the Moss Collection bibliography through Libanus Press. Attached is a list of works Shirley Smith offers to add to the collection. Moss also encloses a photograph of "Cycle of Life" and six photographs of an unidentified location depicting frescos, which appear to be the work of Shirley Smith.</p>
