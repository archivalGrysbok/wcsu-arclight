         <p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882) was an English poet, painter and translator. Born in London, Rossetti hailed from an artistically prodigious family; his Italian father was a Dante scholar while his sister, Christina Rossetti, became a renowned romantic poet and his brother, William Michael, an accomplished writer and critic. Like many members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Rossetti received his early artistic training at Sass's Drawing Academy, London, entering the school probably in 1841. In 1848, alongside William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and others, Rossetti founded the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, a group of English painters, poets and critics. The Pre-Raphaelites sought to reform British art through a return to honest simplicity and the use of luminous colors and literary themes. Rossetti and the Pre-Raphaelites advocated for "truth to nature" in art, their work reflecting a mimesis of nature, rich detail and influences from Quattrocento Italian art. The Pre-Raphaelites received praise and endorsement from the influential art critic John Ruskin who boldly predicted that the Pre-Raphaelites would "lay in our land the foundations of a school of art nobler than has been seen for three hundred years" (Ruskin letter to The Times, 30 May 1851). Rossetti's <title>
               Girlhood of Mary Virgin
            </title> (1849) was the first work to be exhibited carrying the Brotherhood's initials. In addition to his drawing and paintings, Rossetti was a prolific writer, publishing many of his own poems and sonnets and producing a number of translations of Italian medieval poetry, including that of Dante Alighieri.</p>
         <p>The recipient of the letters, William Houghton Clabburn (c.1820-1889), was a Norwich businessman and manufacturer of silk shawls. A close friend and patron of the artist Frederick Sandys, Clabburn came into contact with Rossetti through Sandys's loose association with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. As these letters evidence, Clabburn corresponded with Rossetti in order to commission an oil replica of Rossetti's Mary Magdalen at the door of Simon the Pharisee (1858). The correspondence suggests that Clabburn and Rossetti's relationship was primarily one of patron and artist, however the letters show a friendliness between the pair, with Rossetti referencing mutual friends and acquaintances (including Sandys and Valentine Cameron Prinsep), extending to Clabburn invitations to meet and expressing gratitude for Clabburn's gifts.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection comprises 11 letters from Dante Gabriel Rossetti to William H. Clabburn written from 1863 to 1865. The last of these is addressed to Clabburn's wife, Hannah Louisa. The letters are accompanied by 8 envelopes addressed to Clabburn by Rossetti. Rossetti's letters primarily relate to Clabburn's commission of an oil replica of Rossetti's <title>
               Mary Magdalen at the door of Simon the Pharisee.
            </title> The correspondence records in detail Rossetti's artistic process pertaining to this work. In his letter on 6 July 1865, Rossetti provides an extensive interpretation of the work.</p>
         <p>The <title>
               Mary Magdalen
            </title> replica is described in Surtees's catalogue raisonné, in entry no. 109, R2 (page 65). Surtees notes: "Besides R. I, one, or possibly two, further oil replicas appear to have been begun in the early 1860s. The picture seems to have been commissioned by John Heugh in 1862-3, but was cancelled. It is uncertain whether the head and shoulders of the Magdalene had been painted on the canvas (M. p. 98). Clabburn, a Norwich manufacturer, who recommissioned the picture in 1863, denied that the painting had been begun. By July 1865 the replica was despatched to him but he doubted if it was the work of Rossetti's hand. In 1872 it was bought off him by Fairfax Murray. …"</p>
         <p>The letters demonstrate both Rossetti and Clabburn's influential connections in the contemporary art world. Rossetti refers to his and Clabburn's mutual acquaintance Frederick Sandys (of whom Clabburn was a close friend) and other prominent artists of the time including Valentine Cameron Prinsep, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Alphonse Legros. Indeed, the correspondence indicates that, on occasion, Rossetti acted on other artists' behalf. A letter dated 4 December 1864 reveals that Rossetti arranged for the sale of a Legros's <title>
               La mort de Saint François
            </title> to Clabburn, with Rossetti remarking "You [Clabburn] must know I [Rossetti] have generally been his [Legros's] business secretary". In other instances, Rossetti proffers his opinion on cultural events and institutions, declaring lectures at the "Academy" (presumably the Royal Academy) to be "much of a muchness" and remarking upon exhibitions of the time (3 May 1865).</p>
         <p>The letters disclose the more quotidian aspects of Rossetti's work, detailing price justifications and forms of payment. In one letter, Rossetti describes at length, and in precise measurements, how the scaling up of a piece will affect its price: "If again I were to adopt measurements on a sufficiently increased scale to reach again a convenient proportion for the squaring off, the picture would reach a larger size than I could paint for 200 guineas" (15 June 1863). In another, he provides Clabburn with precise instructions for sending Rossetti payments for <title>
               Mary Magdalen
            </title> (1 May 1865). Rossetti and Clabburn's correspondence provides further insight into Rossetti's belief in his works' worth, revealing Rossetti's confidence regarding the future value of his paintings. In a letter dated 15 June 1863, Rossetti states that he cannot accept Clabburn's commission for anything less than 200 guineas, on account of Rossetti's opinion that "the importance of the large work … will greatly increase the value of any duplicate or work from the same design."</p>
         <p>The collection evidences the increasing prominence of technologies such as photography and the continued use of lithography in creating, duplicating and disseminating artistic works. For instance, in one letter Rossetti states that Legros has agreed to paint a companion picture to one of his works from a lithograph while in another Rossetti describes his process of creating replicas of pieces by working from photographs of the original (4 December 1864 and 15 June 1863).</p>
         <p>In some of the letters, sections of the page have been removed. Generally these are sections containing Rossetti's letterhead crest and monogram, or his salutation.</p>
         <p>Broadly, the collection reveals a warm and friendly relationship between artist and patron, with Rossetti frequently enquiringly kindly after Clabburn's wife and making reference to mutual friends. In one letter, Rossetti gives his profuse thanks to Clabburn for his gift to Rossetti of two live peacocks which he describes as "gorgeous beyond expression – real treasures!" (undated letter, likely written before 23 April 1864).</p>
         <p>The letters are not included in William E. Fredeman's The correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>

               <p>"My Dear Mr. Clabburn,</p>
               <p>I think I ought hardly to preclude myself from making, if I wish, a small copy of the <title>
                     Magdalene
                  </title> picture after the large one is finished. The commission for the large picture was taken some years ago, and at a price greatly below what I should now ask, and I ought therefore to reserve as far as possible the power of making further earnings in connection with it. Nevertheless it is very possible, that I might never have the patience to do the thing [?] a 3rd time, after yours and the large one; &amp; in any case, as I before said, yours would differ very greatly from the other, and I would moreover undertake to make the other smaller than yours if made at all.</p>
               <p>Indeed, to secure you against disappointment with the picture, I would even further promise, hereby, that if, on a third picture being painted, you thought it likely to prejudice the value of yours, or found it lessened your interest in yours, that I would take yours back and give you in exchange any other [illegible] picture of the same value, whenever I might be doing one to your liking. This would be no inconvenience to me, as my picture from the <title>
                     Magdalene
                  </title> design would always, I am sure, be easier for me to dispose of to advantage than almost any one I could do.</p>
               <p>Let me again remind you that yours would be considerably varying from the other small copy; and I have little doubt would be in some respects superior as one is always told in all such cases that the one done first has an advantage as to vividness in conveying the original idea. And if a third were ever made, it would certainly not be for several years to come, as I am sure the large picture will not be completed in one year nor yet in two from this time.</p>
               <p>I hear Sandys called here yesterday, while I was gone to Hampton Races with Val Prinsep. I suppose it must have been a farewell visit (as indeed I thought he was gone at the beginning of the week) and that therefore he may be with you again as soon as this letter. Will you tell him I was very sorry to miss him.</p>
               <p>I hope Mrs. Clabburn is now somewhat better than when I heard so poor an account of her health from you. I hope, whenever I soon [?] have the pleasure of seeing her again at Norwich, it will be under more favourable circumstances. Pray remember me kindly to her and Believe me</p>
               <p>My dear Mr. Clabburn,</p>
               <p>Yours very truly</p>

               <p>"My Dear Mr. Clabburn,</p>
               <p>Thanks for your letter. On taking exact measurements, I find that the photograph is 12 inches by 10 1/2. The plan therefore will be to enlarge it to double its size, making 24 by 21. Two feet square would not therefore be a possible size or exact proportion and any fractional adaption of the measurements would cause more than double trouble in squaring it off. Still, it is not improbable that I might be adding somewhat all round to the composition, in which case it might be rather over 2 feet in height and nearly or quite 2 feet in width, but I could not be certain to an inch, nor would this, as I dare say you will think with me, materially affect the matter. If again I were to adopt measurements on a sufficiently increased scale to reach again a convenient proportion for the squaring off, the picture would reach a larger size than I could paint for 200 guineas.</p>
               <p>I would engage to make the 3rd picture (if made at all) decidedly smaller than yours, but could not at this moment be positive as to size. Still, as the proportional measurement would have again to be of the degree adapted for squaring off, you may be sure, as I say, that the difference would be decided.</p>
               <p>I should be very happy to let you hear the refusal of the 3rd picture proposed. Its price would certainly not be less than 200 guineas, almost certainly more, as I anticipate that the importance of the large work, which done will greatly increase the value of any duplicate or work from the same design.</p>
               <p>I am, dear Mr. Clabburn,
 
 Yours very truly,
 
 DG Rossetti"</p>

               <p>"My dear Clabburn</p>
               <p>I saw Legros who tells me he would paint the companion picture from the lithograph with pleasure, &amp; would sell the 2 landscapes for 50 guineas, framed.</p>
               <p>You will receive the drawing of the <title>
                     Death of St. Francis
                  </title> in a day or two, &amp; I will get his receipt for you in return for the cheque - 25 guineas. You must know I have generally been his business secretary, but he will have another now I dare say, as he has got married.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry to have seen so little of Mrs. Clabburn &amp; yourself this time, but hope that she will really give me other chances as she said. I will have [?] an eye to ramshackle properties of all kinds on her behalf.</p>

                  </title> in hand again, and shall have finished it without fail in six weeks or two months at latest, probably earlier. Meanwhile it would be greatly to my convenience if you would kindly let me have the remainder of its price now on its last resumption instead of on delivery. I have hesitated to ask this favour of you, lest the long delay which has occurred with the picture should cause you to think its completion in the specified time a declining matter. But you may rely on its getting done within the time discussed [?].</p>
               <p>If you will oblige me in this, may I ask you to send me the money on receipt of the present letter, in the form of 2 Bank of England notes for £50 and £20 respectively, by post registered, which from I know by frequent experience that they will reach me quite safely. I always request, when it occurs to me, that money may be sent thus, as cheques, particularly country cheques, give me much trouble through my having no banker.</p>
               <p>With kind rememberances to Mrs. Clabburn (who will with yourself truly be visible here some time in the picture season.) I am, my dear Clabburn,</p>

               <p>The Academy lectures [?] are generally "much of a muchness" I fear. I suppose, as things go, the Athenaeum is likely to be as tolerable as any. I have not yet seen the Exhibition myself. Sandys's picture is in one of the best places, and Whistler &amp; Legros are well placed. Indeed the hanging this year is I believe better than usual.</p>
               <p>With kind regards
 
I am yours sincerely
 
 DG Rossetti"</p>

               <p>"My dear Mrs. Clabburn</p>
               <p>Today I am sending in the "Mary Magdalene" by passenger train, so I hope it will not be long on the road. I may as well describe it a little, to help out my idea, though indeed I believe you would find it plain enough.</p>
               <p>The scene represents 2 houses opposite each other, one of which is that of Simon the Pharisee where Christ and Simon, with other guests, are seated at table. At the opposite house a great banquet is held, and feasters are trooping to it, draped in cloaks of gold and crowned with flowers. The musicians play at the doors, and each couple kiss as they enter. Mary Magdalene has been in this procession but has suddenly turned aside at the sight of Christ, and is pressing forward up the steps of Simon's house, now casting the roses from her hair. At her side is the alabaster box of ointment. Her lover and a woman have followed her out of the procession and are trying laughingly to turn her back. The woman bars the door with her arm. Those nearest Magdalene in the group of feasters have stopped short in wonder and are looking after her, while a beggar girl offers them flowers from her basket. A girl near the front of the procession has caught sight of Mary &amp; waves her garland to turn her back. Beyond this the narrow street abuts on the highroad and river. The young girl seated on the steps is a little beggar who has had food given her from within the house, and is wondering to see Mary go in there, knowing her as a famous woman in the city. Simon looks disdainfully at her &amp; the servant who is setting a dish on the table smiles, knowing her too. Christ looks towards her from within, waiting till she shall reach him. A fawn crops the vine on the wall below the window where Christ is seen, and some fowls gather to share the beggar girl's dinner, giving a kind of equivalent to Christ's words, "Yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs."</p>
               <p>I shall be glad of a word to say that the picture has reached you safely. I hope all your family are now well, and with kindest remembrances,</p>
               <p>I remain,</p>
               <p>My dear Mrs. Clabburn,</p>
               <p>Yours very sincerely,
 
DG Rossetti"</p>
