         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>"There has never been a time when Joshua Reynolds was not regarded as one of the great men of the Enlightenment in England and a portrait and history painter of tremendous versatility, inventiveness, originality, and ambition.</p>
         <p>Reynolds was the seventh of the ten or eleven children of a schoolmaster and his wife, both of whose families were abundant with Church of England clergymen. Showing prodigious talent as a boy, he was apprenticed for four years to the London portrait painter Thomas Hudson of Lincoln's Inn Fields, before establishing a burgeoning portrait practice in London and Plymouth. In 1749-50, Reynolds traveled to Italy and France by way of Spain and Morocco. In Rome he copied the Old Masters, for eighteen months scouring the city's churches' princely art collections and working his way back across the Continent, similarly absorbing a host of artistic exempla. Upon his return to London, Reynolds resumed his portrait practice and achieved rapid commercial and critical success, although the failure of some of his experiments with certain fugitive pigments and varnishes was soon apparent.</p>
         <p>Beginning in 1760, when he leased a large house at 47 Leicester Square, Reynolds exhibited with the Society of Artists but eventually distanced himself from the squabbles that increasingly divided the members from their committee. He also hesitated before accepting the invitation to become the first President of a rival "Academy" that was founded in 1768 with patronage of King George III. As President, Reynolds was knighted in April 1769, an honor that was not without precedent but that signaled Reynolds's certain preeminence in the institutional art world of London. In the <title render="italic">
               Discourses
            </title> he delivered as President, Reynolds set out the principles to which a great national school of art should adhere, ennobled by poetry and eloquence, intellectual dignity, and the purity of the so-called great style of Michelangelo, Raphael, and the Florentine-Roman tradition of <emph render="italic">disegno</emph>.</p>
         <p>In the 1770s and 1780s, Reynolds's portrait subjects included most of the great men and women of the age: his own good friend Dr. Samuel Johnson, the king and queen, Sir Joseph Banks, James Boswell, Oliver Goldsmith, David Garrick, and others. He created a sideline in imaginative portrait studies of children, known as "fancy pictures," and also experimented with history painting. As Reynolds aged, he showed an increasing awareness of and interest in Dutch art and continued to be showered with honors, both domestic and foreign. In old age, the deafness he blamed on a chill he said he caught in the Sistine Chapel got worse (but that, like his harelip, was probably hereditary); in addition, his eyesight deteriorated. Although he was immensely self-important, and to that extent personally vain, in his marvelous self-portraits Reynolds freely acknowledged the existence of all three maladies, most obviously the harelip, but also his ear trumpet and spectacles, while other artists in their portraits of him rarely acknowledged their existence. After his death in 1792, Reynolds's body was attended by ten pallbearers, among whom were three dukes, two marquesses, three earls, and a cortègee of ninety-one carriages."--Paul Mellon's Legacy (2007).</p>

            <emph render="boldsmcaps">Frederick Whiley Hilles (1900-1975)</emph> was a longtime professor of English at Yale University and editor of works on Samuel Johnson, James Boswell, and Joshua Reynolds. Hilles collected correspondence and other manuscript writings by James Boswell, Thomas Carlyle, Samuel Johnson, Joshua Reynolds, and members of their families. Most of this material is now at the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (Yale University), in the Frederick W. Hilles Manuscript Collection (<ref xlink:actuate="onRequest"

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>

                  <p>In this privately printed pamphlet Baretti criticizes Siries for editing and publishing Baretti's translation of the first seven of Sir Joshua Reynolds' <title render="italic">
                        Discourses
                     </title> (Delle arti del disegno. Firenze, 1778) without mentioning Baretti's name in the publication, and for altering the text. Distributed gratis throughout Italy, particularly in Tuscany (cf. Hilles, p. 54). Discussion of this pamphlet and an English translation appear in Hilles, F.W. Literary career of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1936 ed.), p. 51-59. This copy is addressed in manuscript (and was evidently mailed to) Giuseppe Pelli, director of the Royal Art Gallery in Florence.</p>

                  <p>"The following jeu d'esprit was written by Sir Joshua Reynolds to illustrate a remark which he made, 'That Dr. Johnson considered Garrick as his property, and would suffer anyone to praise or abuse him but himself.' In the first of these supposed dialogues, Sir Joshua himself, by high encomiums upon Garrick, is represented as drawing down upon him Johnson's censure; in the second, Mr. Gibbon, by taking the opposite side, calls forth his praise."--Title page verso.</p>
