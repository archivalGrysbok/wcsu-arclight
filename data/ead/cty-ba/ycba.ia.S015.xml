         <p>Jules David Prown earned his Bachelor's degree at Lafayette College (1951), an MA in Early American Culture from the University of Delaware (1956), and an MA (1953) and Ph.D. from Harvard University (1961). He was a fellow in the Winterthur Program from 1954-1956. Prown was appointed the Edward R.

Prown served as Assistant to the Director of the Fogg Art Museum between 1959 and 1961. In 1961, he joined Yale University as an instructor, and he served as curator of Garvan and related collections of American Art at the Yale University Art Gallery from 1963 to 1968. He became Assistant Professor at Yale in 1964 and was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship from 1964-1965.
