         <p>This collection consists of 126 8x10 color photographs taken of the Brick House, Paul Mellon's personal gallery on his property in Virginia. The photographs detail both the collection of work amassed within the gallery and the exterior of the house. The photos are attributed to Steven Tucker. They are believed to have been taken in the 1980's and sent to the Yale Center for British Art in 2001 for use in the exhibition catalogue "The Paul Mellon Bequest: Treasures of a Lifetime."</p>

         <p>The Brick House was the location of Paul Mellon's private collection of fine art, racing memorabilia, and rare books until 1999. Much of the collection was donated to the Yale Center for British Art for its founding; the rest was distributed to a number of public institutions upon Mellon's death.</p>
         <p>The house itself is a neo-colonial property on Mellon's Virginia estate in Upperville, originally designed by William Adams Delano. Mellon moved into the house with his family in 1941, just prior to serving in World War II. In 1961, after a decade of being unoccupied, the Brick House was renovated to house the collection. There was a room dedicated specifically to Mellon's second wife Rachel's collection of wax sculptures by Degas.</p>
