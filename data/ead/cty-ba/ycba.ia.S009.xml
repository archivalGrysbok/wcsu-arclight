         <p>This collection consists of three notebooks created by Paul Mellon for a "Pictorial Art" class at Yale University during his undergraduate studies (1925-1929). The notebooks include Mellon's professor's course material on pictorial art, pictures of artwork, and Mellon's handwritten notes. The notes include Mellon's critiques and analyses of the artworks, which span from ancient to contemporary.</p>

         <p>Paul Mellon earned his Bachelor's degree at Yale University in 1929, focusing his coursework on English studies. He then attended Clare College within Cambridge University until 1931, when he began working for his father, Andrew Mellon's financial enterprise. In 1936, he decided to become a professional patron and philanthropist, eventually establishing the Bollingen foundation with his first wife, Mary Elizabeth Conover Brown. In 1948, Mellon married Rachel Lloyd, whose interest in art prompted him to develop relationships with various London and New York dealers. In 1961, heeding the advice of art historian Basil Taylor, Mellon hired John Baskett to curate his growing collection of British art and rare books. In 1966, Mellon gave the building, works of art, and endowment that established the Yale Center for British Art. The Center opened in April of 1977.</p>
