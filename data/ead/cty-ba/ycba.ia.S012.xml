         <p>The project includes a paper transcript and recordings of the Jules David Prown Oral History Project. For the project, information analyst Karen E. Denavit interviewed Prown about his family, professional life, and travels.  Particular attention is paid to Prown's interactions with Paul Mellon in the years 1968-1977, while the Yale Center for British Art's building and design were being decided.</p>
