         <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
         <p>Edwin Augustus Porcher (also sometimes cited as EDMUND Augustus Porcher) was born second son to Reverend George Porcher of Maiden Erlegh, Berks. and Francis Amelia Chamier, daughter of John Chamier, Esq. Porcher's paternal lineage can be traced to French Huguenot ancestry, in a line descending from the Counts of Richebourg. In the 17th century Isaac Porcher de Richebourg and his wife Claude Cherigny fled to South Carolina, then under British rule. The Porcher family remained in the American colonies as merchants for four generations. In 1768, James Du Pré Porcher settled in England, where he sired a son, Josias Du Pré Porcher, Esq. of Winslad House, Devonshire, who became MP for Old Sarum. The latter's eldest surviving son was Rev. George Porcher , who married Francis Amelia in 1818, and their two sons were George Du Pré Porcher, Esq., barrister, and Edwin Augustus Porcher (Baird 105). Porcher had many family connections to the Royal Navy: his maternal uncle was Commander Frederick Chamier RN, his paternal grandfather Admiral Sir William Burnaby, and his paternal uncle Henry Porcher, Esq., of Arborfield, Berks. (later MP for Clitheroe) (Naval Biographical Dictionary 915).</p>
         <p>Some accounts report that Porcher entered the navy in 1837, the same year that the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth closed its doors. Though he may have had some training prior to 1837, it is likely that Porcher received much of his education directly at sea from a naval instructor through the "pitchfork system," which replaced formal naval training during this period (Dickinson 57). Like his forerunners, he would have studied arithmetic, Euclidean geometry, algebra, plane and spherical trigonometry, and the uses of instruments and projectiles. The new education system also introduced young sailors to the study of Classics in Latin and Greek. Had Porcher studied at the Royal Naval College, he likely would have been instructed in drawing by John Christian Schetky, a specialist in watercolors and a former marine painter to King George IV and King William IV (Dickinson 50). There is some evidence that Porcher drew from artist handbooks such as Samuel Prout's <title render="italic">
               Prout's Microcosm: The Artist's Sketch-book of Groups of Figures, Shipping, and other Picturesque Objects
            </title> (1841) (see the seated figure in "49. Raines Islet on the Great Barrier Reef [...]" in the National Library of Australia collection).</p>
         <p>After short training cruises as Volunteer First Class aboard vessels such as the Donegal, Porcher commenced his first tour of duty as Mate aboard the HMS Fly in 1842. The Fly and HMS Bramble embarked on a four year voyage to Australia, New Guinea, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Porcher accompanied the Fly on its scientific survey of the Northern Australian coastline, particularly the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. Naturalist Joseph Beete Jukes produced a Narrative of the Surveying Voyage of HMS Fly During the years 1842-1846. Porcher is sometimes recognized as the expedition's "unofficial" artist, involved in the documentation of geological, zoological and anthropological information (Wright 276). The title of official draughtsman went to the artist Harden S. Melville, who published <title render="italic">
               Sketches in Australia and the Adjacent Islands, selected from a number taken during the surveying voyage of H.M.S. "Fly" and "Bramble" […]
            </title>. The resemblance between their work suggests Porcher and Melville may have been close collaborators. A copy of Melville's book (now in a private collection) contains an inserted errata slip inscribed in Porcher's hand (Christie's Melbourne Auction Catalogue, excerpt in E.A. Porcher file, National Library of Australia). The notation identifies the names of the Islanders depicted in Plate 18 (which are not identified by the letterpress), which also suggests that Porcher was attuned to the identities of indigenous individuals he encountered on the voyage. Plates 18 and 20 of Melville's <title render="italic">
               Sketches in Australia and the Adjacent Islands
            </title> appear to correspond to figures pictured in a watercolor attributed to Porcher: "Pacific Ocean, a village in Treacherous Bay, Darnley Island" (National Library of Australia, Canberra).</p>
         <p>Returning for a brief period to England in 1846, Porcher was advanced to Mate status in August of 1846, having passed his exams on the 8th of June 1844 (Nautical Standard and Steam Navigation Gazette 532). He departed for duty again on the steam frigate Sidon bound for the Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East on November 9, 1846. The Sidon performed basic patrol along the North African coast from Morocco to Egypt, also making trips to Cairo. By now an accomplished amateur scholar and draughtsman, Porcher took great interest in archaeological sites and cultural monuments, describing in letters to his sister such monuments as the Arch of Constantine, Trajan's Pillar, and the Pyramid of Caius Cestus. Twelve watercolors from this expedition, along with letters and a small log book, are in the private collection of Dr. Bob Brier. These images depict the pyramids of Cairo, Aboukir Castle, Cleopatra's Needles, and Pompey's Pillar, as well as coastal scenes of Morocco and the Bay of Naples (Bob Brier, email correspondence).</p>
         <p>Porcher set sail on the HMS Cleopatra in May 1849, bound for South and East Asia (as 2nd Lieutenant under Captain Thomas L. Massie). During this tour, Porcher records excursions to Macau, Borneo, and the new treaty ports of Shanghai and Amoy. In his letters to his sister, Madelina, Porcher also indicates that he made two trips to Canton in the company of other officers, meeting with diplomatic officials on these occasions. The Cleopatra was stationed at Hong Kong during the transitional period between the first and second Opium Wars, when Britain's gunboats protected its trading interests and combatted piracy in the region. By the 1840s, large fleets of pirates were forming in the South China Seas, and the Royal Navy was dispatched to police the waters around Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta. The region was at the crossroads of several shipping routes and became the refuge for smuggling and plundering. European involvement in these practices certainly did not help diplomatic relations with the Chinese (Christopher Munn, 72). The Royal Navy did not protect small Chinese merchant vessels, however it was willing to exterminate larger fleets if they were a threat to the British presence. Head money paid for every pirate captured was divided among officers and crew. Piracy increased in the 1850s due to an influx of populations from conflict-ridden Guangdong. The Royal Navy, along with Portuguese, American and Chinese forces, organized campaigns and bombardments of pirate fleets, sometimes destroying villages associated with pirate activity (Munn 245-246). The Cleopatra also patrolled the South China Sea, and was dispatched to Borneo to contend with the Iranun (Illanoon or Lanun) pirates, who had attacked the crew of the HMS Dolphin (see logbook, pages 29-44, and the watercolor "Skirmish with the Illanoon Pirates at Tooncoo on February 16th 1852").</p>
         <p>In February of 1854, Porcher had a brief appointment aboard the steam ship Majestic out of Sheerness, under Captain James Hope, serving in the Baltic Sea . In the same year he was appointed to the screw steam Esk out of Portsmouth, under command of Thomas Birch (also in the Baltic). In 1855, at the height of the Crimean War, the Esk joined the Baltic fleet (of 105 vessels) to conduct naval operations, including the bombardment of Sweaborg, for which Porcher received the Baltic medal (Lambert 281-88; Obituary, "The Week's News," August 24, 1878, page 1071).</p>
         <p>In February of 1857, Porcher was appointed First Lieutenant of the HMS Hibernia, a 104-gun flag ship stationed at Malta. He departed Southampton via the screw steam ship Colombo, arriving at Malta on March 1st. This was not Porcher's first visit at Malta, having previous docked there with the HMS Sidon in 1848. The history of the British occupation of Malta began in 1798, when Lord Nelson, commander of the British fleet, assisted in the overthrow of the French (who, under Napoleon, had overtaken the Order of St. John). Malta became a Crown Colony in 1813 and served as the central Mediterranean base of the British Empire and Navy. A campaign to "Anglicize" Malta emerged in the 1860s, when British naval supremacy began to experience pressure from Prussia and particularly France, which began expanding its imperial ambitions in North Africa (Cassar 141-181). While stationed on the Hibernia, Porcher made a series of outbound trips aboard the HMS Harpy, the HMS Kertch, and the HMS Boxer. On May 1st, 1858, he was appointed to the command of the Harpy, a paddle wheel vessel, in lieu of the ailing Lieutenant Bruce. The Harpy and its crew were instrumental in assisting Nathan Davis in his archaeological excavations of Carthage and nearby remains, especially Utica, and transported the antique sculptures and mosaic pavements that Davis and his team unearthed. The 467 objects  that were unearthed, including twenty-eight Roman mosaics dating from the late first to the mid sixth century AD and a number of Punic votive stelae, were transported to the British Museum on naval vessels. Five of Porcher's watercolors were published in Nathan Davis's Carthage and Her Remains (see watercolor descriptions). Aboard the Kertch, Porcher made four major outbound journeys: to "Leghorn" (Livorno) and Naples (October 29, 1859 - November 22, 1859); to Tunis (February, 1860); to Tunis, Bizerta, Tabakah (June 7, 1860 – July 4, 1860); and to Lata and Messina (July 21, 1860 – July 30, 1860). It appears that three of Porcher's watercolors from these journeys to North Africa illustrate Nathan Davis's travels through these regions, suggesting that Davis might have commissioned Porcher to complete these views retroactively: "70. Tunis. The Ruins of Baal Hammon Molech […]," "71. The Mosque of Dowar-Eshutt […]," and "75. Village of Camart […]."</p>
         <p>Porcher likely met Lieutenant Rupert Murdoch Smith of the Royal Engineers through Nathan Davis, Smith having just arrived in Malta from his excavations with the British Museum's Keeper of Antiquities, Charles Newton, at Halicarnassus and Cnidus (Thorn 17). Inspired by their recent archaeological activities, Porcher and Smith devised a plan to explore the ancient archaeological sites of Cyrene: "I have formed a project of going to examine Cyrene and the Pentapolis and hope to be able to carry it out. The only information about it is Captain Beechey's book… I should like to go and make plans of the principal sites between Cyrene and Bengazi but chiefly Cyrene itself" (R.M. Smith to Charles Newton, 18th May 1860, British Mus. G.R. Dept. Orig. Lett. II (1861-1868) fol. 705). The Hibernia log-book includes entries for the HMS Boxer, which took Porcher and Smith as far as Benghazi. Their self-funded ten month expedition yielded the earliest photographic views of the Necropolis at Cyrene and at least 89 drawings (views and plans), a number of which Porcher donated to the British Museum in 1865. Smith and Porcher arrived in Cyrene on Dec 23, 1860 and began clearing debris from rock-cut tombs, using a tomb near the Fountain of Apollo as their "tomb of residence", and a range of rock-cut chambers as kitchen, stables, and store rooms.</p>
         <p>When the British Museum learned of Porcher and Smith's discoveries, the Trustees awarded them 100 pounds towards expenses and 500 pounds to hire a team of workmen to carry out more extensive excavations (see Thorn). 148 sculptures and sculptural fragments were retrieved at their dig sites, which forms an important component of the British Museum's antiquities collection. An illustrated publication of their expedition, <title render="italic">
               History of the Recent Discoveries at Cyrene Made During an Expedition to the Cyrenaica in 1860-61
            </title> was published by Day &amp; Son in 1864. The lithographic plates are adapted from Porcher's watercolors, plans, and maps. In October 1861, Porcher sailed back to Malta via the HMS Melpomene, which also transported 63 cases of antiquities (22 cases were shipped with the Assurance in June 1861) (see log book, YCBA). There is indication that he was assigned to the Hibernia once more, and reported for duty on the Bustler and Redpole, steam tugs tendered to the Hibernia (Smith 5). As of 1861, Porcher was classified with the Transport Service Agents Afloat and on Dec 27 1861, he was appointed to rank of Commander.</p>
         <p>Between 1862-3, Porcher produced images of Ireland and the English south coast. On January 12, 1863, he was elected Fellow of Royal Geographic Society (Athenaeum, January 17 1863, 89).  He received his own command on March 4, 1865, becoming Captain of the HMS Sparrowhawk, based in the Northern Pacific station of Esquimalt, Vancouver Island, British North America. A ship's log indicates he traveled the customary trans-Atlantic route via Rio de Janeiro, with stops at Madeira, the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands. The ship called at Valparaiso on the Chilean coast, which was the southern Pacific headquarters of the British Navy, and Callao, Peru. After reaching Hawaii, Porcher sailed on to the Pacific Northwest. A personal diary housed at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library provides an account of Porcher's activities between March 9, 1865, and October 14, 1868.</p>
         <p>Reproduced in its entirety (with edits and annotations) by Dwight L. Smith in <title render="italic">
               A Tour of Duty in the Pacific Northwest
            </title>, and in typed transcript form at the Beinecke (Box  5, folder 1), the diary chronicles Porcher's travels and relations with the local indigenous populations. In July of 1867, Porcher delivered a lecture at the Mechanics' Institute on the formation of coral reefs in Australia, demonstrating his interest in the promotion of scientific knowledge: "Capt Porcher very minutely described the process, illustrating his lecture by chalk drawings on the blackboard… The lecturer was listened to with the greatest attention, and whenever a pause occurred the gratified audience loudly applauded" (<title render="italic">
               British Colonist
            </title>, July 31, 1867).</p>
         <p>During this tour of duty, Porcher was given additional diplomatic responsibilities. He was invited by the Governor of Vancouver Island to investigate a property dispute between the Canadian Company and the Flume Company referred to by the local press as the "Grouse Creek War" (<title render="italic">
               British Colonist
            </title>, August 2, 1867). He was also made a magistrate before a northward journey to territories where relations with indigenous groups were seen as contentious. This allowed him to arbitrate in disputes with indigenous groups and in inter-tribal conflicts impeding on British activities. Several views of the Christian mission at Metlakatla (Maaxłakxaała, which means "saltwater pass") and Fort Simpson were produced. A few of Porcher's drawings were published as engravings in <title render="italic">
               The Columbia Mission Annual Report
            </title> (10th and 11th volumes, 1868, 1869). He departed Esquimalt in April, 1868, and arrived back in England on October 14.</p>
         <p>During his travels (in 1865 and 1866), Porcher's residence was listed at 50 Montague Square, London, so it is possible that he returned to reside there upon his return to civilian life (Yule). He was promoted to Captain on October 16, 1868, and married in the spring of 1869 in Alton, Hampshire (England &amp; Wales, FreeBMD Marriage Index, 1837-1915). By 1871, he and Elizabeth Porcher were living in Marylebone, London, with his sister Agnes Rick and their five servants (1871 England Census). He officially retired from service in 1872. It appears that  Porcher had a child by the name of Frances Mary Kotar, who is listed in 1873 as "an infant by Edwin Augustus Porcher esq (a Captain in the Royal Navy) her guardian George Du Pre Porcher" in the legal case "Stratton v. Ravenscroft" (C 16/897/S297, Cause # 1873 S297, National Archives, Kew). Although it does not appear that Porcher conducted any further official Royal Navy business, he had not withdrawn from public life. He attended meetings of the Royal Geographic Society, and the Council of the Hakluyt Society, for which he was listed as  member in 1876 and 1877 (listed in Council, Yule and Veer). 
 
Never tiring from travel, it appears that Porcher's last sketching tour in continental Europe was conducted for pleasure, as many of his drawings depict resort and spa towns. This body of work, dating from 1869 to 1877, consists of views of cultural sites and picturesque landscapes in Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Italy. Porcher died on August 13, 1878, at Homburg, Germany, aged 53 (England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar, 1878).</p>

         <p>E.A. Porcher donated 16 drawings related to his Cyrene expedition to the British Museum in 1865. He left his remaining papers and watercolor works to Lieut. Col. Cecil Du Pre Penton Powney (b. 1862), his sister's surviving son, who donated views, plans and elevations from the Cyrene expedition to the British Museum in 1894. The remaining manuscripts and drawings were inherited by Powney's daughter, Beryl Wyndham Powney (c. 1896 -1976). Several components of the Porcher collection were sold by private dealers beginning in the 1970s (see 'Related Archival Materials Note' for Porcher holdings in other institutional collections).</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents</head>
         <p>The collection comprises: one watercolor frontispiece and 84 watercolors depicting scenes from Porcher's voyages (36 watercolors from 1850-53, 48 watercolors from 1857-60). Also present is a Porcher's diary with descriptions of the ports visited between September 1851 and April 1853, including Hong Kong, Borneo, Shanghai, and Rangoon. The journal includes eight meticulously drawn maps, charts, and diagrams. There are also three letters written by Porcher to his sister Madelina: two from Hong Kong in 1849 and 1852 and the other from Moulmein in April 1853. The collection also includes two logbooks and three certificates, which document Porcher's service to the Royal Navy.</p>
         <p>Note on attribution: the frontispiece drawing includes an erased signature at bottom right: "H.S. Melville." It matches the known signature of Harden S. Melville and indicates that Porcher and Melville may have collaborated on this, or possibly many, of Porcher's watercolors. Harden S. Melville was trained by his father, the London engraver, lithographer and watercolor painter Henry Melville (1826-41). Unlike Porcher, Melville was a trained artist, having earned a medal from the Society of Artists and exhibiting three paintings at the Royal Academy exhibitions between 1837 and 1841.  In 1841, he accepted the position as draughtsman on board HMS Fly, where he would have likely met Edwin Augustus Porcher, who was Mate on the voyage. Melville supplied nineteen drawings and two maps for Joseph Beete Jukes's <title render="italic">

         <p>The preparatory watercolor for a frontispiece, "Sketches taken during my voyages &amp; travels. E.A. Porcher" (see: Series III Miscellaneous) suggests that Porcher intended to publish a set of watercolors representative of his entire body of work. In the 1970s, the Porcher collection was sold in separate lots to various repositories. As the YCBA's collection is mounted and labeled in an identical manner to other collections of Porcher material, these collections will be briefly outlined below.</p>

         <p>Call numbers: NLA MS 4602</p>
         <p>Comprises: 30 watercolors; official logs of HMS Prince George (247 pages) and HMS Fly (219 pages); 4to private journal (66 pages); 8vo extract from an exercise book giving the dimensions of the HMS Fly and daily positions of the voyage from England to Van Diemen's Land, Sydney and back to Plymouth; certificate of official appointment of Porcher as Mate dated June 8, 1844 (folded foolscap). Accessioned in 1972.</p>
         <p>The HMS Fly completed the first hydrographic survey of the Northeastern Australian coast and offshore islands (1842-5). Porcher's journal describes making scientific and surveying observations in and around Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania), up  the coast of (present-day) Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. There are also images of locations Porcher encountered en-route such as the Brazil coast, Java, New Guinea, Porto Praya and Madeira. He describes the establishment of astronomical and magnetic observations in Van Diemen's Land and at Cape Upstart. His watercolors include a depiction of Ross Observatory, Hobart, Van Diemen's Land and the stone lighthouse tower at Raine Island (Great Barrier Reef) erected by members of the Fly, Bramble and 20 convicts lent from New South Wales. Possibly with the instruction of the naturalist Joseph Beete Jukes, Porcher's journal pays particular attention to flora and fauna, especially species of trees and birds. Porcher's journal is valuable for its description of natural history and engagements with local Aboriginal tribes, particularly on the North-east coast of Australia.</p>

         <p>Includes: 12 watercolors dating from 1847-1849; logbook from HMS Sidon steam frigate under Captain William Honyman Henderson during his tour of the Middle East; three letters written to his sister, Madelina, during the voyage. Porcher's watercolors represent monuments in Egypt (Pyramids at Giza, Cleopatra's needles, Pompey's Pillar) and  coastal views of Morocco. It also depicts the harbor of Santa Lucia in Naples. The log book was removed from a larger volume (contiguous with the HMS Fly log at the National Library of Australia, which includes the first page of the Sidon log). His letters to Madelina indicate that the ship's party visited monuments such as St. Paul's, the Arch of Constantine, Trajan's Pillar, and the Pyramid of Caius Cestus "where we remained some little time looking at the different relics that are supposed to have been brought from the Holy Land."</p>

         <p>Comprises watercolor drawings from E.A. Porcher and R. Murdoch Smith's archaeological expedition to Cyrene (Libya) in 1860-1, some of which became the basis for engravings and lithographs in the publication <title render="italic">
               History of the Recent Discoveries at Cyrene made during an Expedition to the Cyrenaica in 1860-1
            </title> (London, 1864). Extant are 89 drawings on Whatman paper in three sizes (58 views and 31 plans). 16 of these were donated by Porcher to the British museum in 1865 (5 watercolor views, 9 plans, 1 elevation, and 1 drawing of an inscription). The remaining 73 drawings (52 watercolor views, 20 plans, and 1 elevation) have been assigned new registration numbers by museum staff (2012,5033.1-73) (Celeste Farge, British Museum, Email Correspondence, May 20, 2013). A portion of these were donated to the Museum in 1894 by Cecil Du Pre Penton Powney (Porcher's nephew) and include Porcher's duplicates of drawings (with signature). A list on blue foolscap accompanying the watercolors identifies a total of 112 drawings, including a small sketchbook of 29 drawings from the Cyrene expedition. By all indications, the sketchbook was broken up  and the drawings were individually mounted after it was obtained by the British Museum. Based on current holdings, some of the 112 watercolors are presumed lost (see Thorn 224). Unpublished illustrations fall under a numbering system (Porcher's system) as 87-137. The YCBA watercolors include a set numbered 70-86, possibly contiguous with the British Museum's watercolors.</p>

         <p>Two views of Metlakatla (one a copy of a view in private collection) and an album containing 27 watercolors inscribed in ink and dated 1862-9. Duplication of subjects and compositions in the sketchbook indicates that some of these were preparatory versions for later works (now housed at the Beinecke Library). In 1863-4, Porcher produced images of the English south coast and Brazil (including Rio de Janeiro). He travelled through the Straits of Magellan and northwards up the coast of South America. After reaching Honolulu, Porcher sailed on to Esquimalt, Vancouver Island. Some of the 1866 views from these travels were engraved for the tenth and eleventh <title render="italic">

         <p>Call number: WA MSS S-1972</p>
         <p>Comprises 53 watercolors dated April 1865 – September 1868, depicting subjects from Porcher's tour of duty to Esquimalt, the Royal Naval base on Vancouver Island, British Columbia aboard the HMS Sparrowhawk. Also includes: a journal, 240 pages, 8vo.; logbook 47 pages, 8vo.; and four documents commending Porcher's conduct, one of which promotes him to the standing of Captain, RN. The collection was acquired in 1972.</p>
         <p>The Royal Navy was deployed in the Pacific to protect Britain's commercial and political interests in the Pacific, while also serving as diplomatic agents when necessary. A Crown colony of Vancouver Island was established to prevent American advancement into disputed territory and Esquimalt became the strategic base for British in the North Pacific. Porcher was made a magistrate so that he could arbitrate in disputes between tribal groups and the European populace (see E.A. Porcher journal, Beinecke Library). His interest in Northwest Coast cultural expressions is evident in his watercolors, where he documents Haida, Tsimshian and Coast Salish totem poles and house posts.</p>

            <emph render="bold">Danforth Art Museum, Framingham</emph>
         </p>
         <p>Consists of 57 watercolors gifted in 1976 and 1977 by Robert Pirie. Exhibited as "The Grand Tour, Watercolors by E.A. Porcher" at the Danforth Art Museum in 1977. These drawings date to Porcher's later years, after his retirement from the Royal Navy (1872).  The images represent sites encountered during travels to European spa and resort towns, cultural monuments, fortifications, and beauty spots such as Lake Como, Drachenfels mountain (on the Rhine), and Isola Bella. The recorded sights in Germany, Belgium, Bohemia, Austria and Italy reveal Porcher's abiding interest in local history. He takes great interest, for instance, in the Wurtemberg fortifications at Ulm, Castle of Godesberg Bacharach, San Vitale at Ravenna, Church of Santa Maria Assunta, Ehrenbreitstein Fortress, Aix-La-Chapelle.</p>

                     <p>Porcher describes the pagodas of Rangoon in his journal: "The town of Rangoon is situated on the north shore of a considerable branch of the river that extends to the westward about a league, and is about 24 miles from the entrance. The Dagon Pagoda supposed to be the finest in this part of the country, and held in high veneration by the natives by its containing light true hairs of Gautama, is about 2 miles from the town in a NNW direction, on an elevation of 487 feet above high water level, part of which is supposed to be artificial. It commands a fine view of the surrounding country, and both branches of the river" (65). Porcher has pictured himself sitting, sketching the scene depicted. George Hunt's illustrations for <title render="italic">

                        </title> (1825-26) may have been an artistic model for Porcher's view.</p>

                     <p>Porcher describes the significance of the significance of the Martaban river as "the boundary between the Burmese dominions, and the territory ceded to the British Government" (66). The date of the watercolor roughly corresponds to a letter sent to his sister, Madelina, in which he briefly describes conditions following the Second Anglo-Burmese war (see Miscellaneous series, 1853 letter).</p>

                     <p>This representation illustrates the fashion of British colonial modes of transport by the early 1850s.  Chinese figures carry a palanquin, while a horse-drawn carriage also charges by. Happy Valley was the site of a British racecourse and a Protestant Cemetery (see watercolor "11").</p>

                     <p>The Hong Kong Cemetery (also known as the Protestant Cemetery and the Colonial Cemetery) was opposite the oldest racecourse in Hong Kong in Happy Valley, and in the middle of a line of cemeteries that included the Roman Catholic cemetery (founded 1848) and later Islamic cemetery (1870). In 1853 (a year after this view), the captain and crew  of the HMS Cleopatra erected a monument to Scottish trader and explorer Robert Burns, grandson of the poet, who was killed by pirates of the Tunku River (for which the Cleopatra was dispatched to avenge, see watercolors '25' and '27').</p>

                     <p>Jardine &amp; Matheson Co. were the most powerful opium merchants in Hong Kong. They founded their company in 1832, grew rapidly by exporting tea and silk to England, and by smuggling opium. They purchased land in the Causeway area when Britain acquired Hong Kong after the Treaty of Nanking, at the conclusion of the first opium war. Porcher's journal describes the "patent slip" at Jardine's Establishment, where "ships of about 500 tons… can be hauled up" and repaired (6). A drawing of the purchase for hauling the vessels is included on page 7 (diary).</p>

                     <p>"Joss House" was the derogatory term used by the British to refer to Chinese temples. The word "Joss" was derived from the Portuguese deos or God, adapted in the pidgin trading language at Chinese ports (Whitworth 463-464). Tai Ping Shan means "peace hill" and was named after the area's peaceful settlement after the conclusion of an 1810 sea battle between pirates and Qing Dynasty warships. This peace was interrupted when British warships arrived, and the street became a traditional Chinese enclave in the Victoria Peak region otherwise dominated by the British garrison. Taoist, Confucian and Buddhist worshippers happily co-mingled along the street, and Porcher's view likely depicts the temple devoted to "Jai Kung", or "poor man's Buddha", constructed in 1851 as a temporary repository for the stone tablets of Hong Kong's deceased, whose remains were far from their ancestral burial grounds. A statue of the god Tai Chong Wong presided over the souls of the deceased (Ingham 107-109).</p>
                     <p>The image of the Chinese barber may have been inspired by the work of George Chinnery (1774-1852), who completed several sketches and at least one oil of the subject.</p>

                     <p>Shek-Pai-Wan is a bay between Hong Kong and Aberdeen Island. The British were initially attracted to waterfall at Aberdeen because it was a source of fresh water supply. A short journey from Aberdeen, Hap-Lee-Chow (Ap Lei Chau Island) was an important maritime center. Temples (called "Joss Houses" by the British) were important places of prayer for local fishermen, who would give offerings to ensure plentiful catches (Ingham 142).</p>

                        </title>, October 4, 1851, which reported an "Attack on Chinese Pirates by the Boats of Her majesty's Ship 'Cleopatra,'" (402). On June 24th, the Superintendent of the police received news that fishermen at Mir's Bay had been attacked by a fleet of junks led by  "Shap-'ng-tchi" (Shap-ng-tsai, the infamous pirate). Captain Massie of the Cleopatra ordered the barge, cutter, and pinnace (manned by Porcher and Hon. C. Crofton) armed and deployed. When the pirate junks were sighted near Bias Bay, a five hour chase ensued.</p>
                     <p>Three junks were run up to the head of the bay and driven on shore, while their escaping crews ran into the hills. "Weichow and Tamshuy" were taken as prisoners to the Victoria Gaol. <title render="italic">

The sails of the boats have suffered the most, and bear sufficiently honourable testimony to the severity of the encounter" (<title render="italic">

The Royal Navy's destruction of pirate fleets was controversial, as the monetary rewards ("head money") distributed to officers was seen as a questionable private motivation. Concern was raised over the deaths of innocent people on board (captives of pirates).</p>

                     <p>As Porcher notes in his diary, Amoy (today called Xiamen) was the most important harbor in the province of Fujian and was dominated by foreign trade at the turn of the 18th century. The island of Kulang Su (Gulangyu), on the western side of Xiamen's harbor, was once occupied by British troops after the capture of the city in 1841 until it was restored to Chinese in 1845 (Nield 99). Its five British batteries are still visible in Porcher's view. In his diary, he expounds the strategic advantages of this location: "In case of another misunderstanding with the Chinese the island of Kulang-su would be well adapted for a settlement, the channel between it and Amoy being only 672 yards wide – the ridge of hills on the island being higher than those opposite. There are two distinct ridges which might be separately defended, the highest point being 280 feet above the sea. The island is principally granite, and the soil being formed of it in a decomposed state…. Fresh water from wells are plentiful, and artificial channels conduct it to boats" (53).</p>

                     <p>Whampoa was the way-station between Macau and Canton before the institution of the treaty port system. It was a popular subject among European and Chinese export artists, as foreign ships would anchor there before sending goods on smaller boats  to Canton. A typical merchant ship's journey up the Pearl River Delta would first dock at Macau, then to Lintin Island, then travelling onwards through the estuary of the Bocca Tigris (Human), finally anchoring at Whampoa. In 1844, Chinese authorities proposed rules to prevent smuggling via Portuguese lorchas, requiring they bear registration numbers and report for examination. Lorchas had been involved in the importation of cannon for native insurgents and sometimes passed themselves off as British (Perdue, n.p.).</p>

                     <p>On September 12, 1851, the HMS Dolphin was attacked in Maladu Bay by Illanun pirates. Captain Robertson and Supercargo Robert Burns (grandson of the poet) and the crew were murdered by pirates from Tunku. In response, the Cleopatra, Semiramis and Pluto were dispatched from Singapore on January 10th and arrived at Labuan by the 20th, sailing on to Mengatal to hold a meeting with local ruler Pangeran Madand about bartering with the Iranun (Illanun) Pirates and providing them a boat. A "Mr. Melrum" accompanied the diplomatic party to negotiate the repayment of a debt (see Porcher's diary, page 30). Porcher depicts the British crews firing a salute upon arrival at the Pangeran Madand's village.</p>

                     <p>The incident Porcher depicts was reported in the <title render="italic">
                           Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle
                        </title> for 1852 (222-223). Porcher and the crew of the Cleopatra, Pluto and Semiramis were traveling up the Tunku river in pursuit of the Illanun [Iranun] pirates responsible for the murder of the HMS Dolphin's crew (see "25. Official visit of the Boats of the Cleopatra to the Pangeran Madoud's house"). When they arrived at the residence of Rajah Muda, marines and armed men landed to find white flags hoisted on the roof of the houses. Porcher reports: "In retaliation for their having fired at us the day before, when white flags were flying, both at the Chief's house, and also in our boats, about 40 houses were burned, and the little property that was found in them destroyed, as well as their paddy, fruit trees, etc." (34). The pirates returned fire again, killing one man and wounding two others. Porcher continues with a detailed description of the Iranun pirates from Mindanao, who were known for murdering crews of vessels "except those they are able to sell as slaves". The entire landscape is frenetic with action; figures are hiding behind foliage with guns, while gunfire issues from the British vessels in the river.</p>

                     <p>Penang, an island off the coast of the Malaysian Peninsula, was first occupied by the British East India Company in 1786, and became a British 'Straits Settlement" along with Province Wellesley, Malacca and Singapore when the Anglo-Dutch Treaty (1824) brought these under the administration of the British East Company. It became an important trading center under the British, its commercial architecture dotting the shoreline of Porcher's watercolor.</p>

                     <p>Singapore is at the crossroads of Indian and Pacific Oceans, the Malacca, Sunda and Lombok Straits, and the South China Seas, which made it a key trading center in the India-China route. This view overlooking the Singapore River was taken from an observation point on Mount Wallich, named after Nathaniel Wallich who founded the settlement's Botanical and Experimental Garden. Today the view is no longer replicable, as Mount Wallich was levelled in 1885. Significantly, Porcher's view pre-dates one of the most well-known panoramic paintings of this viewpoint by Percy Carpenter, Singapore from Mount Wallich, 1856. Many of the same structures are visible in both the Porcher and Carpenter: Government Hill and Governor's House, the colonial residence built in 1822 by G.D. Coleman, which itself provided the colonial administration with an uninterrupted view (most view of Singapore were commissioned from this vantage point). The elevated vantage point also eliminated the unattractive mangrove swamps that dominated low-lying areas. The spires of the Armenian Church of St. Gregory the Illuminator and the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd; the broad esplanade of Telok Ayer street; the Telok Ayer market, also built after designs by Coleman, on the spit of land jutting into the basin (Pieris 43-45; Wong and Waterson 96).</p>

                     <p>Government Hill features prominently in views of Singapore, often as the apex of the composition, as Porcher has done in this view from the South Boat Quay near the junction with Market Street. Raffles had established his presence and political control by appropriating the traditional elevated domain of the Malay Rulers, who occupied it (then called Bukit Larangan 'Forbidden Hill') in the fourteenth century (Wong 37). In Porcher's view, the river is bustling with traffic: small sampans ferry passengers to the arched landing and a Malay perahu-mayang fishing boat brings in its catch at lower right. A number of warehouses lining the banks of the river are accessible by the Thomson's Bridge – the only access to the commercial town. Porcher labeled the Master Attendant's building (at right), which was the headquarters of the Master Attendant of the British entrepot and a post office. In a lithographed version of Porcher's view by Vincent Brooks, a nakhoda (boat captain) was added in the foreground, and a Javanese trading vessel at left. Several boats filled with cargo, and a display of tropical fruits perched dockside entices viewers to the 'exotic' goods flowing in and out of the port (see Hong Suen Wong page 72 for Vincent Brooks lithograph).</p>

                     <p>The Grand Harbour was the cultural, administrative and business center of the island. The Order of St. John urbanized the space around the Harbour in the 16th century, and Valletta was constructed as the capital of the islands following the Ottoman Siege of 1564. As the administrative core of the Matese islands, Valletta's city planners stressed efficiency and centralization (Cassar 125-6).</p>

                     <p>"In fine, it may be said that Malta is as defensible as nature and art combined can render it" (Martin 159). Fort St. Angelo, also known as Castrum Marus, was first constructed in 878 AD as an Arab fortification and was built up by successive waves of invaders, and became the headquarters of the Grand Master.

                     <p>A set of caves described as "Calyspo's Grotto" were so called because they were thought to be described by Homer: "large was the grot in which the nymph be found" (fifth book) (Badger 288). In 1838, a British traveler writes: "Any admirer of natural scenery will be delighted with the prospect which stretches before the sight from the summit of this hill. The green spot beneath, washed at its base by the Bay of Mellieha, the islands of Gozo and Comino in the distance, and the rugged heights around, form a coup d'oeil not everywhere to be enjoyed in the island of Malta" (Badger 289).</p>

                     <p>Porcher's image represents an artifact from the Siege of Rhodes (1522), when the Ottomans under Sultan Suleyman I expelled the Order of St. John from the Island of Rhodes (now Greece). Sir Ernest Barker describes the events: "Early in the morning of New Year's Day, 1523, the trumpet of the Knights sounded for the last time in Rhodes; their fleet of thirty-one ships, with the refugees on board, put out to sea." (Baker 51). Fifty vessels and approximately 5000 Rhodians departed the island, which was of strategic importance to the Turks, lying between Constantinople and Alexandria. In 1530, Charles V of Spain gave the Knights of St John control of the Maltese islands, but they became vassals of the King and pledged oath to the King of Sicily (Atauz 82).</p>

                     <p>Turgut Reis (also known as Dragut Rais) was a privateer and head of the Barbary Corsairs who led the victorious campaign against Tripoli in 1551 for Suleyman the Magnificent. He also led the Siege of Malta, the culmination of struggles in the Mediterranean beginning with Ottoman control of Tunisia (Keyvanian 49). In 1565, Suleyman ordered the Siege of Malta. After leading the capture of Fort St. Elmo, Turgut Reis was struck by shot from cannon fire from Fort St. Angelo that fell near the Turkish battery. He was mortally wounded, creating a tremendous set-back for Turkish forces.</p>

                           Carthage and Her Remains
                        </title>. Davis writes that the remains of the Molech structure was being used as materials for modern buildings (he includes a ground plan on page 148 of his publication). Described as vaulted structure, most likely surmounted by a triple dome, Davis concludes it must have contained a series of galleries and circular pilasters: "twelve to represent the twelve months, and four times twelve the forty-eight weeks of the ancient year." Its circular form symbolic of the earth's orbit, Davis is certain that it is a temple of Saturn, "the Baal Hammon of the Carthaginians, or Cronus… the God of Time" (Davis 231). Davis imagines that the temple once contained a terrifying image of Baal. A plan of the Dais, interpreted as the Temple of Saturn in the Carthage, is included facing page 177. The date of the watercolor (post-dating the Davis expedition, 1856-59) suggests Porcher was commissioned to return to the site to produce the watercolor for the publication.</p>

                     <p>After arriving at Carthage, Nathan Davis complains of the conditions of the two existing villages, Moalkah and Dowar-Eshutt: "irregular mass of hovels chiefly built of ancient materials". He begins digging at Carthage, and takes up residence at Dowar-Eshutt. The drawing was published in Davis's account as "Village of Dowar-Eshutt (Scene of the First Excavation)" (page 59).</p>

                        </title> (page 387). Whereas Porcher's watercolor is in a very loose style, and includes three figures, the engraving adds two additional figures conversing. It also renders the palace on the hill more visible. Davis describes the "Jebel Khawi," the Catacomb Hills at Camart as a vast network of catacombs. "To the right in our sketch" the excavations unearthed the ruins of a Roman mausoleum, and remove some pavement and a broken statue. The date of Porcher's watercolors suggests that he returned to the site to produce additional watercolors for Davis's publication (post-dates Davis expedition).</p>

                     <p>This watercolor was engraved and published as "A View of the Site of Utica" in Nathan Davis' <emph render="italic">Carthage and Her Remains</emph> (page 414). The engraving omits the seated figures and inverts the two main figures and the horse, adding a running figure with a musket. Davis writes: "At the exact time specified by Lord Lyons, HM steamer "Harpy" arrived. She was commanded by Lieut. Porcher, who was instructed by the admiral not only to convey me to the sites of the various ancient cities above named, but to render me every assistance in his power – instructions which this officer was ready to carry out, and did carry out to the best of his abilities." Porcher and his  crew (praised by Davis as "sturdy marines") assisted with the removal and transportation of a number of mosaics and sculpture from the excavation site at Utica, which according to Davis was once on the water but now "seven or eight  miles' distance from the sea". Utica aided Rome in the destruction of Carthage. Davis describes the area as already "ransacked of building materials," and yet "marble and granite shaft, capitals, and cornices of every order, size and dimension, which lie about here in all directions, are certainly a great attraction for antiquarian research" (409).</p>

                     <p>A wash drawing diagram of the 'hunters mosaic' found in Utica. This may have been used to prepare the engraving "Plan of a Chamber Discovered at Utica" for Nathan Davis' <emph render="italic">Carthage and Her Remains</emph> (page 417). "On close inspection of this ruin, I decided on sinking a shaft at a spot which I believed was beyond the wall. A few hours of careful digging brought to light another mosaic, placed upon a raised semicircular alcove, appertaining to the same chamber. It represents a water-scene, and contains eleven different sorts of animals, among which I may mention the board, the leopard, the ostrich, the stag, etc." A net with floats, hauled by two men in 'curiously shaped canoes', led Davis to call this the 'Hunters Mosaic.' Positing that the scene represents an 'inundation,' the mosaic lends further proof to Davis's theory that Utica was originally a maritime city (419).</p>

                     <p>Mounted with Porcher's diagram of the "hunters mosaic", this watercolor was the basis for an engraving of the same name in Nathan Davis' <emph render="italic">Carthage and Her Remains</emph> (page 405). Davis
describes the site: "In the direction of the cape we have the remains of a theatre, which must have been gorgeously decorated, judging from the numerous fragments of rich marbles which are here found" (408). The archaeologist forms the theory that the theater was practical for the representation of naval battles, as water could be dispensed from the nearby aqueduct into the amphitheater, then emptied into the harbor below. He concludes: "A double object was thus attained: the people were gratified by an attractive exhibition, and the public reservoirs were regularly cleansed" (407).</p>

                  <p>Holograph diary, labelled: "E.A. Porcher. Notes on Ports Visited in H.M.S. CLEOPATRA, September 1851 – circa 1853". Includes the following small pen and ink drawings: "purchase for hauling vessels up at Jardine's slip" (page 7), chart (18), map of Labuan (20), diagram (25), 2 sketches (26), sketch of a lighthouse (45) and a map of Amoy (55).</p>
                  <p>Porcher provides general descriptions of the ports visited by the Cleopatra, including hydrographical information, natural resources, natural history, and inhabitants. The diary is roughly divided into sections describing the following topics: the island and harbor of Hong Kong; monsoons, currents, and other weather patterns affecting navigation of the China Sea; Labuan; A Conflict with Pirates in Borneo, 1852; the Straits of Singapore; Shanghai; Amoy; Macau; Hong Kong's population; Burma.</p>
                  <p>Porcher begins with Hong Kong, describing its general topographical character, soil, climate, measurements, demographics, and geology. The main feature of the island is "the secure and convenient harbor," which he notes has "induced the English plenipotentiary to select this island, and owing to the few inhabitants becomes a much safer retreat for the English in case of another misunderstanding with the Chinese" (1-2). Hong Kong is preferable to nearby Chusan, in Porcher's view, which had a number of islands where pirates could easily hide or escape. Upriver at Whampoa, an island where foreign traders would unload their cargo onto smaller vessels to take up the narrow Straits to Canton, Porcher lists some foreign vessels at the dry dock such as the "Villa de Bilboa" (a Spanish frigate), a patent slip in Jardine's establishment, and the "Royalist," the steamer "Canton" (6). As a result of the European populace who resided there for several months of each year, Whampoa became a cosmopolitan way-station between the Chinese city of Canton and the Portuguese colony of Macau.</p>
                  <p>The diary provides valuable insight into how naval ships negotiated changing weather conditions in Hong Kong and in travel between South China sea ports. Pages 7-15 are devoted to explanations of meteorological information: the South-West monsoon, which occurs from April to October; the North-East Monsoon, which prevails from September or October in the north; typhoons on the southern coast in June and July; Gales that blow steadily in September on the China coast; and variable currents which depend on local wind, shoreline, and monsoon conditions. Porcher's log might have been intended for use by future officers in determining the best seasonal  routes and naval maneuvers in the region.</p>
                  <p>He provides a general description of the Island of Labuan, off the coast of Borneo, which was originally proposed as a British base against piracy in 1840 and became a Crown Colony in 1848. His descriptions strike a note of interest in the natural products and cultivation – information useful for determining Labuan's suitability for settlement and resource extraction. Particularly interested in raw materials such as camphor wood - valuable for its gum, oil, and use as insect repellent – and rattan for rigging and furniture, Porcher stresses that "the most important product is certainly the coal," he writes, "both in a political as well as commercial view" (23). This point was of strategic importance to the British navy, as a steady supply of coal was essential for steamship operations, and "should the steam route through the Eastern Archipelago come into practice, this coal district would be of vast importance" (24). Porcher also speculates that the island could be conducive to the lucrative cultivation of cotton, sugar, rice, coffee (27). Another of its exports is leeches, evidently still used to treat disease.</p>
                  <p>Pages 29-44 of Porcher's diary are devoted to incidents in early 1852, in which members of the Cleopatra's crew was dispatched on the steamers Semiramis and Pluto to seek out pirates who had murdered the crew of a small trading schooner, the HMS Dolphin. With the Political Agent for Borneo and Captain Brooke from Sarawak accompanying the expedition, the Cleopatra first stopped at Gaya Bay in late January to meet with the Chief Pangeran Madand, "about his rendering the Illanun [Iranun] pirates assistance, particularly in selling them a boat in which they went pirating in" (30). Some marines disembark, but then all at once "the men in the boats were suddenly fired upon from the jungle, that grew close down to the water on each side, and one man killed and two wounded." (33). The next day (February 18), the boats return to the chief's house and burn forty houses and property in revenge for the previous day's ambush. The men in boats were again shot upon from the jungle – one killed, two wounded. Porcher illustrates select episodes from this incident (see "25. Official visit of the boats of the Cleopatra to the Pangeran Madoud's house […]" and "27. Borneo. Skirmish with the Illanoon pirates at Tooncoo […]"). Devoting pages 37-44 to a lengthy description of the Iranun pirates, he explains the details of the pirate escape routes, hideouts, vessels, and fighting weapons (42).</p>
                  <p>With its rapidly increasing trade as a result of treaty port status, the formerly isolated trading center of Shanghai "is likely erelong to become the principal emporia in China" (48), speculates Porcher. Its advantageous position at the junction of two rivers allow communication with Suchow-fu, the capital, as well as Yunnan and Su'chuen [Sichuan?]. Merchandise such as silk, cotton, bamboo, bronze and earthenware attract interest, but food products most of all – "dining rooms, tea houses, and bakers shops are met with in at every step" (49). A temperature table "from Dr. Lockhart's hospital report" is included for comparison with Hong Kong's climate.</p>
                  <p>Porcher describes the southwest corner of the island of Amoy [Xiamen] as "the most important harbor in the province of Fuhkien [Fujian]," delighting in the "picturesque" scenery  caused by the number of pagoda-topped islands dotting the bay (52). At the western side of the harbour is Kulang-su [Gulanyu], littered with batteries and once occupied by  English troops after the city's capture in 1841. Porcher is quick to recommend Kulang-su for English settlement, "in case of another misunderstanding with the Chinese," for its strategic position between high ridges and as a source of fresh water (53). Moreover, the location's lack of significant waves makes it an ideal spot for repair docks (54).</p>
                  <p>Porcher describes Macau, the Portuguese colony, as "a far more healthy and agreeable residence than Hong Kong, on account of its being open to all breezes" (56). The lack of harbor in the vicinity is one drawback, however, that forces ships to anchor four miles away from the main town. He describes the means by which ships might pass the Typa anchor in the low water, and in monsoons. This description is followed by a population chart of Hong Kong for 1851, broken down into the demographics: Europeans and Americans (647); Goa and Macao Portuguese (489); Indians, Malays and Natives of Manita (221); aliens or temporary residents (13) and Chinese (31,983). The Chinese are then broken down by locations and occupations. A "map of Canton, Macao, Hong Kong, and the adjacent islands" on page 62 is in Porcher's characteristic, meticulous hand.</p>
                  <p>In his last pages, Porcher conveys the dangers of running aground along the Rangoon (Burma/Myanmar) coast in the Southwest Monsoon, due to its "many creeks and rivers with reef and shoal water" (64). And yet braving this is well worth the trouble for the traveler, as the town is situated on the shore of a great river, and the magnificent Dagon Pagoda is "supposed to be the finest in this part of the country" (65). During the "last war," East India Company surveys penetrated up the river, and the town has "every prospect of being a very flourishing place, after it has been our possession a few years, it will make a good building establishment" (65). The area known as the Martaban or Salween river was ceded to the British government and the village of Amherst built on a peninsula on the mouth of the river. Moulmein [Mawlamyine], about 25 miles from Amherst, was founded as the principle British settlement on the northern boundary. A description and table of rainfall at Moulmein during the Southwest monsoons from 1845-52 completes Porcher's description of Rangoon's physical geography and meteorology.</p>

                  <p>Logbook recording daily positions during the HMS Cleopatra's tour of duty. It commences with an account of the weight of various articles on board and the dimensions of the HMS Cleopatra, 26 Guns. The vessel departed Plymouth on May 13, 1849. It  anchored at Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, and Labuan before arriving at Hong Kong October 15, 1849. The vessel sailed to Bombay, Malacca, Penang and Madras in 1850 and made repeat trips to Singapore and the South China Seas. The Cleopatra made  its return voyage to England (via Cape of Good Hope), and docked in September 1853.</p>

                  <p>Navigational logbook recording daily positions during his tour of duty in Malta and the Middle East on the HMS Hibernia, H.M. Paddle wheel Harpy, HMS Schooner Kertch, and HMS Boxer. Porcher departed England for Malta on the Screw Steam Ship Colombo (February 20, 1857). Joining the Harpy in May 1858, he sailed with the Rev. Nathan Davis to Goletta, Tunisia, to assist with the archaeological expedition. On October 29, 1859, he departed for Livorno ("Leghorn") and Naples, returning November 22 the same year. He sailed twice to Tunis on the Schooner Kertch, once in February 1860, and in June, 1860. He departed for Benghazi in the HMS Boxer in November 1860. The dates of Porcher and Smith's expedition to Cyrene are omitted, likely because it was not under the auspices of Her Majesty's Service, but the  logbook picks up again on their return to Malta via the HMS Melpomene (under command of Captain Ewart) in October 1861.</p>

                  <p>This drawing, a frontispiece study for an unpublished publication or collection, combines visual elements from select locations of Porcher's travel, repeating motifs from his own work. Depicted are scenes from Australia (Aboriginal Australians or Torres Strait Islanders, upper left corner), Burma (stupa, center), India (elephant and howdah, lower right corner), Hong Kong (Chinese junk, center), the Middle East (scene from Tunisia or Libya, lower left). The albatross, while possibly a reference to Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, could also be a quotation of Porcher's watercolor "The Wandering Albatross of the Indian Ocean, July 1842," (National Library of Australia). An erased signature "H.S. Melville" at bottom right matches existing signatures by Harden S. Melville.</p>

                  <p>Headed: "HMS Cleopatra, Hong Kong."</p>
                  <p>A letter from Porcher to his sister, Madelina, in London. He expresses concern about the cholera epidemic in Europe. He also describes a trip to Canton with some fellow officers, which he obtained leave to conduct. He relates an outsider's view of the city around the 'factories' area, where foreigners were permitted to stay. He also describes Whampoa, the location where foreign boats docked: "This is a very stupid place… As the town is built on piles on a mud flat, but all the merchant shipping remains here, as they cannot get nearer Canton on account of the river being  shallow about this." Hong Kong leisure activities is a topic of interest for Porcher, who lists a dinner with the Governor and the Club as the "chief amusement." However, he is careful to note the danger which the island presents to Englishmen: "it is not safe at present to go far into the country as there have been many murders lately."</p>
